...which I guess happens in patch 35 now?

When do we have items with the same id?

I guess that happens if we have multiple transactions adding items to
the cil at the same time?  I guess that's not a big deal since each of
those threads will hold a disjoint set of locks, so even if the order
ids are the same for a bunch of items, they're never going to be
touching the same AG/inode/metadata object, right?

If that's correct, then:
