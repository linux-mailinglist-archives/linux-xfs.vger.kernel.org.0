Thanks!

Welllp... the defer ops code only logs up to 16 extents per EFI log item
due to my, er, butchering of max_items.  So in the end, we log up to 8x
EFI items, each of which has up to 16y EFIs...

...and by my estimation, those eight items consume a fraction of the
reservation available with tr_itruncate:

16 x xfs_extent_64_t   = 256 bytes
1 x xfs_efi_log_format = 8 bytes
                       = 272 bytes per EFI

8 x EFI                = 2176 bytes

So far, I haven't seen any overflows with the reaping code -- for the AG
btree rebuilders, we end up logging and relogging the same bnobt/cntbt
buffers over and over again.  tr_itruncate gives us ~320K per transaction,
and I haven't seen any overflows yet.

This might actually become more of a problem if we want to reap an
inode-rooted btree, each block is in a different AG, and there are (say)
more than 128 AGs... but I think the solution to that will be to
xrep_defer_finish between AGs.
