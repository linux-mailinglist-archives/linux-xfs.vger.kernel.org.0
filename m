Hmm, so this all has me a a bit concerned over the value proposition for
these particular feature checks. The current reflink/rmap feature
situation may work out Ok in practice, but it sounds like that is partly
due to timing and a little bit of luck around when the implementations
and interdependencies landed. This code will ultimately introduce a
verification pattern that will likely be followed for new features,
associated log item types, etc. and it's not totally clear to me that
we'd always get it right (as opposed to something more granular like
incompat bits for intent formats). Is this addressing a real problem
we've seen in the wild or more of a fuzzing thing?

That sounds like an odd thing to do to a stable kernel, but that's just
my .02.
