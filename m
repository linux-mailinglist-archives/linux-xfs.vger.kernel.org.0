Sure, I am not opposed to alternate propositions as long as people are 
generally in agreement with the direction that its moving.  I think this 
was kind of a tough series for people to grok and review, so I certainly 
want to be mindful of everyone's feelings on it moving forward.  You are 
certainly welcome to send out some more ideas.  Let me see if I can get 
the below code compiled and getting through the test case.  Lots of 
times ideas can end up looking different in practice and it tends to 
shape opinions about how to move forward with it.  Thanks for the reviews!
