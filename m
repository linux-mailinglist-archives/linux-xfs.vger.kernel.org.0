Yeah, I ran xfs_repair together as well, For smaller sizes, it seems
all fine, but I did observe some failure when much larger values
passed in, so as a formal patch, it really needs to be solved later.

Anyway, this patch tries to show if the overall direction is acceptable
for further development / upstream. And I could get some more
suggestion from it..

Actually, I did in the same way (use xfs_alloc_vextent()) in my previous
hack version
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/xiang/linux.git/commit/?id=65d87d223a4d984441453659f1baeca560f07de4

yet Dave pointed out in private agfl fix could dirty the transaction
and if the later allocation fails, it would be unsafe to cancel
the dirty transaction. So as far as my current XFS knowledge, I think
that makes sense so I introduce a separate helper
xfs_alloc_vextent_shrink()...

I tend to avoid bury all shrinking specfic logic too deep in the large
xfs_alloc_vextent() logic by using another new bool or something
since it's rather complicated for now.

Intoduce a new helper would make this process more straight-forward
and bug less in the future IMO... Just my own current thought about
this...

Yeah, currently I don't tend to defrag or fix agfl in the process but rather
on shrinking unused space (not in AGFL) and make the kernel side simplier,
since I think for the long term we could have 2 options by some combination
with the userspace prog:
 - lock the AG, defrag / move the AG, shrinking, unlock the AG;
 - defrag / move the AG, shrinking, retry.

I thought about this topic as well, yeah, anyway, I think it needs
some clearer documented words about the behavior (round down or round
up). My original idea is to unify them. But yeah, increase the size
of the shrink might cause unexpected fail.

In my previous random version, I once renamed it to bdelta, but I found
the modification is large, I might need to clean up growfs naming first.

Yeah, actually my previous hack version
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/xiang/linux.git/commit/?id=65d87d223a4d984441453659f1baeca560f07de4

did like this, but in this version I'd like to avoid touching unrelated
topic as much as possible.

xfs_buf_delwri_submit() is not no-op for empty lists. Anyway, I will
use 2 independent logic for entire extend / shrink seperately.

Thanks for your suggestion!

Thanks,
Gao Xiang
