I'm not sure what this means.

Are you saying that log shutdown wakes up iclog waiters before it
processes pending callbacks?  And then anyone who waits on an iclog (log
forces, I guess?) will wake up and race with the callbacks?

Hmm.  I think my guess above is correct, then.  I /think/ the code looks
ok based on my above guess at comprehension.
