Future patches use the the perag that is passed down through these
functions. e.g. the next series of patches that pass a perag to the
btree cursor init functions rather than the plain AG. Passing the
pag down the stack ehre means that the lower layers modified in this
patch don't need to look up the perag again.

i.e. read this "don't have to add lookups in future", not as "will
remove existing lookups right now".

Cheers,

Dave.
