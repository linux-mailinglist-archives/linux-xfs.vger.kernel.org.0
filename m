I decided against changing the shortform directory verifier to ignore
the dotdot pointer on nlink==0 directories because older kernels will
still have the current behavior and that will cause recovery failure for
the following sequence:

1. create A and B and delete A as per above, leave B open
2. shrink fs so that A is no longer a valid inode number
3. flush the shrink transaction to disk
4. futimens(B) (or anything to dirty the inode)
5. crash
6. boot old kernel
7. try to recover fs with old kernel, which will crash since B hadn't
   been inactivated

But I guess I'll have to go write an fstest to prove that I'm not
making this up...
