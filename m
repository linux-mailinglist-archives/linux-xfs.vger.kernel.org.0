It has been pointed out to me that this appears to make it sound like I think 
the whole conference is useless.  I would like to make it clear that this is not 
the case at all.  This is still the only conference that I make sure to make it 
to every year, because all of the reasons I list.

The point of me posting this is to get us to put some real thought into what 
would be the most optimal way to accomplish the same things in a different way. 
Maybe I should have titled it "Make LSFMMBPF great again!" instead.

I feel that there is a lot of fat to trim here, and many voices not being heard 
because of the way the conference is organized.  If I'm the only one then that's 
cool, but if I'm not I'd like people to think really hard about what the ideal 
meetup looks like, and how we can move in that direction.  Thanks,

Josef
