If you want to take a pull request, then use "git pull" (or "git fetch"
followed by "git merge") which will create a merge commit committed by
you.  The above commits were applied to your tree by you as patches (or
rebased) and so need your sign off.  The commits in a branch that you
just merge into your tree only need the SOBs for their author(s) and
committer.

If you then rebase your tree (with merge commits in it), you need to
use "git rebase -r" to preserve the merge commits.  alternatively, you
can rebase the commits you applied as patches and then redo the
pulls/merges manually.  You generally should not rebase other's work.

Of course, you should not really rebase a published tree at all (unless
vitally necessary) - see Documentation/maintainer/rebasing-and-merging.rst
