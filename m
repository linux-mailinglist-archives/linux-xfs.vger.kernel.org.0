Source kernel commit: e6fff81e487089e47358a028526a9f63cdbcd503

When we replay unfinished intent items that have been recovered from the
log, it's possible that the replay will cause the creation of more
deferred work items.  As outlined in commit 509955823cc9c ("xfs: log
recovery should replay deferred ops in order"), later work items have an
implicit ordering dependency on earlier work items.  Therefore, recovery
must replay the items (both recovered and created) in the same order
that they would have been during normal operation.

For log recovery, we enforce this ordering by using an empty transaction
to collect deferred ops that get created in the process of recovering a
log intent item to prevent them from being committed before the rest of
the recovered intent items.  After we finish committing all the
recovered log items, we allocate a transaction with an enormous block
reservation, splice our huge list of created deferred ops into that
transaction, and commit it, thereby finishing all those ops.

This is /really/ hokey -- it's the one place in XFS where we allow
nested transactions; the splicing of the defer ops list is is inelegant
and has to be done twice per recovery function; and the broken way we
handle inode pointers and block reservations cause subtle use-after-free
and allocator problems that will be fixed by this patch and the two
patches after it.

Therefore, replace the hokey empty transaction with a structure designed
to capture each chain of deferred ops that are created as part of
recovering a single unfinished log intent.  Finally, refactor the loop
that replays those chains to do so using one transaction per chain.
