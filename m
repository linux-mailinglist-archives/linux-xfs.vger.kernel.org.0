My benchmarking was limited to working with a maximum of 1,000,000 xattrs. I
will address the review comments provided on this patchset and then run the
benchmarks once again ... but this time I will increase the upper limit to 100
million xattrs (since we will have a 32-bit extent counter). I will post the
results of the benchmarking (along with the benchmarking programs/scripts) to
the mailing list before I post the patchset itself.
