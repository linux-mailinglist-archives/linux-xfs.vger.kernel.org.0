I think need to engage SuSE support and engineering, then, as this
is not a kernel supported by upstream devs. I'd be saying the same
thing if this was an RHEL frankenkernel, too.

Storage layers returned -EIO a second before things went bad.
Whether that is relevant cannot be determined from the information
provided.

And there are unknown proprietary modules loaded, so we can't trust
the code in the kernel to be operating correctly...

I'm not sure there's really anything upstream developers can help
with without any idea of how to reproduce this problem on a current
kernel...

Cheers,

Dave.
