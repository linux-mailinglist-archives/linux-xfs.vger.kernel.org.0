Maybe killing it off is indeed the better option.  And in that case this
patch to disable it for RT devices would be a good start.

I always found the protofile stuff really weird and not actually useful.

mke2fs -D actually does seem useful if you want to generate an xfs
file systems and fill it without having admin privileges.  I think that
is what the mke2fs feature is used for.
