From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

Recently, the upstream kernel maintainer has been taking a lot of heat on
account of writer threads encountering high latency when asking for log
grant space when the log is small.  The reported use case is a heavily
threaded indexing product logging trace information to a filesystem
ranging in size between 20 and 250GB.  The meetings that result from the
complaints about latency and stall warnings in dmesg both from this use
case and also a large well known cloud product are now consuming 25% of
the maintainer's weekly time and have been for months.

For small filesystems, the log is small by default because we have
defaulted to a ratio of 1:2048 (or even less).  For grown filesystems,
this is even worse, because big filesystems generate big metadata.
However, the log size is still insufficient even if it is formatted at
the larger size.

Therefore, if we're writing a new filesystem format (aka bigtime), bump
the ratio unconditionally from 1:2048 to 1:256.  On a 220GB filesystem,
the 99.95% latencies observed with a 200-writer file synchronous append
workload running on a 44-AG filesystem (with 44 CPUs) spread across 4
hard disks showed:

Log Size (MB)	Latency (ms)	Throughput (MB/s)
10		520		243
20		220		308
40		140		360
80		92		363
160		86		364

For 4 NVME, the results were:

10		201		409
20		177		488
40		122		550
80		120		549
160		121		545

Hence we increase the ratio by 16x because there doesn't seem to be much
improvement beyond that, and we don't want the log to grow /too/ large.
This change does not affect filesystems larger than 4TB, nor does it
affect formatting to older formats.
