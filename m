Naive question:

Obviously, the spec of stradard xattrs does not allow duplicate keys,
but dabtree does allow duplicate keys, does it not?

So if you were to allow duplicate parent pointer records, e.g.:

(parent_ino, parent_gen) -> dirent_name1
(parent_ino, parent_gen) -> dirent_name2

Or to optimize performance for the case of large number of sibling hardlinks
of the same parent (if that case is worth optimizing):

(parent_ino, parent_gen, dirent_name[0:178]) -> (dirent_name1[179:255])
(parent_ino, parent_gen, dirent_name[0:178]) -> (dirent_name2[179:255])

Then pptr code should have no problem walking all the matching
parent pointer records to find the unique parent->child record that it
needs to operate on?

I am sure it would be more complicated than how I depicted it,
but having to deal with even remote possibility of hash collisions sounds
like a massive headache - having to maintain code that is really hard to
test and rarely exercised is not a recipe for peace of mind...

Thanks,
Amir.
