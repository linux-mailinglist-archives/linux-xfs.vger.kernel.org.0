Under what circumstances do they eat up that much memory?  And is that
per-class?  Or per-tracepoint?

TBH it'd be really nice if there was /something/ in the build path that
would complain about disused tracepoints.  I often put in tracepoints
while developing a feature, then the code gets massively rewritten
during review, and none of us remember to rip out the orphaned traces...

...oh, you /do/ have a program and it's coming down the pipeline.
Excellent <tents fingers>. :)
