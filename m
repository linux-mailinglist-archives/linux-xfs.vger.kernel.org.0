That's one of the goals. The other goal is to avoid needing to
account for log op headers separately in the high level CIL commit
code.

Yes.

Thanks!

How is that any different from sending out 6-7 separate dependent
patchsets one immediately after another?  A change to one patch in
one series results in needing to rebase at least one patch in each
of the smaller patchsets, so I've still got to treat them all as one
big patchset in my development trees. Then I have to start
reposting patchsets just because another patchset was changed, and
that gets even more confusing trying to work out what patchset goes
with which version and so on. It's much easier for me to manage them
as a single patchset....

Cheers,

Dave.
