I can certainly help with QA the upgrade scenarios.

How convenient :)
I can start testing already.

I think that would make a lot of sense. We do need to reduce the upgrade
test matrix as much as we can, at least as a starting point.
Our customers would have started with at least 1TB fs, so should not
have a problem with minimum logsize on upgrade.

BTW, in LSFMM, Ted had a session about "Resize patterns" regarding the
practice of users to start with a small fs and grow it, which is encouraged by
Cloud providers pricing model.

I had asked Ted about the option to resize the ext4 journal and he replied
that in theory it could be done, because the ext4 journal does not need to be
contiguous. He thought that it was not the case for XFS though.

Thanks,
Amir.
