Ok. I guess that makes sense here because these are sync I/Os and this
appears to be the only way to wait on a partially constructed chain
(that I can tell).

Sure, a failure in a bio chain is essentially a partial write similar to
if one such bio in the chain had failed. What about the non-chaining
case? What happens on submission of an empty read/write bio? Does
behavior depend on the underlying storage stack?

Note that I see this patch is likely going away. I'm just saying I think
we should have some confirmation on how the block layer behaves in these
situations before we take an approach that relies on it. Is an empty bio
essentially a no-op that serves as a serialization mechanism? Does the
block layer return an error? Etc.

Right, that is the behavior I was referring to above.

In this case, we return an error that the caller will handle and
shutdown the fs. That's reasonable behavior here since these are sync
I/Os.

Oops, this comment was misplaced. I meant to write this in response to
the changes to xlog_map_iclog_data(), not xfs_buf_ioapply_map() (hence
the note about handling log I/O errors above).

The former has no such error checks that I can see. AFAICT, if we
construct a partial or empty bio here, we'd warn and return.
xlog_map_iclog_data() is a void function so the caller has no indication
anything went wrong and submits the bio. If an empty (?) or partial bio
doesn't return an error on bio completion, we've completely failed to
account for the fact that we've written a partial iclog to disk.
