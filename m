Sure.. I can put that next on the list. Is the latest release pending a
post or already posted? Being out for over a month (effectively closer
to two when considering proximity to the holidays) caused me to pretty
much clear everything in my mailbox for obvious reasons. ;) As a result,
anything that might have been on my radar prior to that timeframe has
most likely dropped completely off it. :P
