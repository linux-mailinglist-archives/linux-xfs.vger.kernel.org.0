I'm on the fence about that, but probably.  I've though that generic/
can have a test that formats a small fs and fills it with files until it
hits ENOSPC, and this test (with its weird calculations) can move to xfs/.

But I haven't been around long enough to know if there's a specific
reason why we calculate the number of files to create?  Is this test
really a regression test for some long-ago bug?  Or that weird noalloc
dir update mode thing that we ripped out last year?
