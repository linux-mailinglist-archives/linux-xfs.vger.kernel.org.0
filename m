My prime idea was to attach them to the transaction and keep them
over transaction roles.  Then see what is left and probably use an
on-stack struct containing three dquots.  At that point I know if
that idea was feasible, because if we have too many deep callstacks
where we need to pass that struct it obviously isn't.

Most of our ops really just have one transaction / set of rolled
over permanent transactions, because if they didn't they wouldn't
be atomic..
