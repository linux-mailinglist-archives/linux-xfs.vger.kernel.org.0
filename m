Ok, now we're finally getting somewhere.  You kick off fsstress, and
only *then* turn on the debugging knob.  If it happens that the knob
gets turned on after the cntbt lookup succeeds but before the call to
xfs_btree_islastblock, then we *can* end up in the situation where a
previously checked btree block suddenly starts returning EFSCORRUPTED
from xfs_btree_check_block.  Kaboom.

Looking back at commit 27d9ee577dcce, I think the point of all this was
to make sure that the cursor has actually performed a lookup, and that
the btree block at whatever level we're asking about is ok.

If the caller hasn't ever done a lookup, the bc_levels array will be
empty, so cur->bc_levels[level].bp pointer will be NULL.  The call to
xfs_btree_get_block will crash anyway, so the "ASSERT(block);" part is
pointless.

If the caller did a lookup but the lookup failed due to block
corruption, the corresponding cur->bc_levels[level].bp pointer will also
be NULL, and we'll still crash.  The "ASSERT(xfs_btree_check_block);"
logic is also unnecessary.

If the cursor level points to an inode root, the block buffer will be
incore, so it had better always be consistent.

If the caller ignores a failed lookup after a successful one and calls
this function, the cursor state is garbage and the assert wouldn't have
tripped anyway.

So get rid of the assert, and please edit the commit message to include
all these details.
