Some. Maybe many. Unfortunately the number is largely
unquantifiable. However, when it happens it dumps corruption reports
dumped in the log, so I'd say that there aren't that many of them
out there because we aren't getting swamped with corruption reports.

Uh, the previous discussion ended at "considering inode chunks
overlapping the end of the runt AG as valid requires an incompat
feature flag as older kernels cannot access inodes in that
location". i.e. older kernels will flag those inodes as corrupt if
we don't add an incompat feature flag to indicate they are valid.

At that point, we have a situation where they are forced to upgrade
userspace tools to do anything with the filesytsem that the kernel
added the new incompat feature flag for on upgrade.

That's a much worse situation, because they might not realise they
need to upgrade all the userspace tools and disaster recovery
utilities to handle this new format that the kernel upgrade
introduced....

The repair/scrub/whatever code already detects and fix the issue by
removing the bad cluster from the runt AG. We just need to stop the
kernel creating the bad clusters again.

IOWs, it just simpler for everyone to fix the bug like this and
continue to consider the sparse inode cluster at the end of the AG
is invalid.

Alternatively, if users can grow the block device, then they can
simply round up the size of the block device to a whole inode
chunk. They don't need to run repair to fix the issue; the cluster
is now valid because a whole chunk will fit at end of the runt AG.
