Fine by me.

You forgot to add the V4 format to the deprecation schedule in
Documentation/filesystems/.....

<nggggh>

(where TF has this bit of XFS documentation been moved to???)

in Documentation/admin-guide/xfs.rst.

-Dave.

[ Why did that file get moved rather than just linked from it's
original spot in all the -filesystem- documentation?  Can we move it
back, please, like all the other <filesystem>.rst files in
Documentation/filesystems/ ? ]
