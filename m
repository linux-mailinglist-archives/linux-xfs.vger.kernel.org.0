Yes, they're /nearly/ identical in the helper functions they call, but
they're not so similar in intent and how they handle @error values:

xchk_setup_inode prepares to check or repair an inode record, so it must
continue the scrub operation even if the inode/inobt verifiers cause
xfs_iget to return EFSCORRUPTED.  This is done by attaching the locked
AGI buffer to the scrub transaction and returning 0 to move on to the
actual scrub.  (Later, the online inode repair code will also want the
xfs_imap structure so that it can reset the ondisk xfs_dinode
structure.)

xchk_get_inode retrieves an inode on behalf of a scrubber that operates
on an incore inode -- data/attr/cow forks, directories, xattrs,
symlinks, parent pointers, etc.  If the inode/inobt verifiers fail and
xfs_iget returns EFSCORRUPTED, we want to exit to userspace (because the
caller should be fix the inode first) and drop everything we acquired
along the way.

A behavior common to both functions is that it's possible that xfs_scrub
asked for a scrub-by-handle concurrent with the inode being freed or the
passed-in inumber is invalid.  In this case, we call xfs_imap to see if
the inobt index thinks the inode is allocated, and return ENOENT
("nothing to check here") to userspace if this is not the case.  The
imap lookup is why both functions call xchk_iget_agi.

So yes, we do need the complexity of both functions because the
postconditions of the two functions are rather different.
