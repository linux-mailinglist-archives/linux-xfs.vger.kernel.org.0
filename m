Yeah, I noticed that too.  There are two bugs -- the first one is that
the "Block directories only have a single block at offset 0" check in
xchk_directory_blocks is wrong -- they can have a single *dir* block at
offset 0.  The correct check is (I think):

	if (is_block && got.br_startoff >= args.geo->fsbcount) {
		xchk_fblock_set_corrupt(...);
		break;
	}

The second problem is ... somewhere in the bmbt scrubber.  It looks like
there's a file with a data fork in btree format; the data fork has a
single child block; and there are few enough key/ptrs in that child
block that it /could/ fit in the root.  For some reason the btree code
didn't promote it, however.  Seeing as nobody's touched that code
lately, that probably means that scrub is wrong, but OTOH that /does/
seem like a waste of a block.

But, that's as far as I've gotten on that second one and it's late.
Thanks for taking a look! :)
