From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

Currently, the only way to lock an allocation group is to hold the AGI
and AGF buffers.  If a repair needs to roll the transaction while
repairing some AG metadata, it maintains that lock by holding the two
buffers across the transaction roll and joins them afterwards.

However, repair is not like other parts of XFS that employ the bhold -
roll - bjoin sequence because it's possible that the AGI or AGF buffers
are not actually dirty before the roll.  This presents two problems --
First, we need to redirty those buffers to keep them moving along in the
log to avoid pinning the log tail.  Second, a clean buffer log item can
detach from the buffer.  If this happens, the buffer type state is
discarded along with the bli and must be reattached before the next time
the buffer is logged.   If it is not, the logging code will complain and
log recovery will not work properly.

An earlier version of this patch tried to fix the second problem by
re-setting the buffer type in the bli after joining the buffer to the
new transaction, but that looked weird and didn't solve the first
problem.  Instead, solve both problems by logging the buffer before
rolling the transaction.
