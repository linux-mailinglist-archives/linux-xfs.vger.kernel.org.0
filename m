So should we combine both: minimal FS size and those XFS variables which would
allow to use lower size for XFS? I wonder which which size would be relevant,
it might be safer to use 64 MB:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/xfs/xfsprogs-dev.git/tree/mkfs/xfs_mkfs.c
/*
 * Realistically, the log should never be smaller than 64MB.  Studies by the
 * kernel maintainer in early 2022 have shown a dramatic reduction in long tail
 * latency of the xlog grant head waitqueue when running a heavy metadata
 * update workload when the log size is at least 64MB.
 */

Because there is really not a big difference between 256MB and 300MB.

Kind regards,
Petr
