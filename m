We might run into that, but I'm perhaps naively willing to tell people that
if they were hard-coding reverse-engineered filesystem heuristics to the
nearest kilobyte, too bad so sad, they were doing it wrong.

I (maybe also naively) think it's reasonable to increase the log size for
small filesystems, given that they often as not become large filesystems
these days, and the ultimate % increase in size will be negligible.

(It's somewhere on my todo list to figure out how various products and
provisioning mechanisms actually create, transport, and expand these
minimized images, to see what the requirements really are ...)

I do agree. I just think that if the concern is a distro noticing the
difference, then the distro can carry the patch to get rid of that difference.
That's something I have had to do as well a times. With my upstream hat on, I
would rather keep distro version concerns out of the upstream patch, is all.

I'd miss you a lot if that happened. :(
