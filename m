I'm not sure -- if someone set (say) a 256k cowextsize and later wants
to unshare a single 4k block of that, they might think it's useful for
the fs to try to push surrounding writes to the same 256k region to
combat fragmentation.

OTOH if the cowextsize is (say) 2M (or 1G) then that might be excessive?
Particularly if the cow reservation shadows an already unshared data
fork block, in which case (as you point out) this turns a cheap
overwrite into an expensive cow.  IOWs, we're trading less fragmentation
for higher individual write times.

Hmm, maybe there's another aspect to think about -- for a directio cow
write, I think we skip the cowextsize thing and only allocate the exact
range the caller asked for.  If that's correct, then perhaps unshare
should follow the directio write allocation pattern if the struct file
has O_DIRECT set?
