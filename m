no problem... in the meantime, xfs_bmap finished as well,
resulting output has 1.5GB, showing total of 25354643 groups :-O

those are streams from many cameras, somehow multiplexed by processing software.
The guy I communicate with, whos responsible unfortunately does not know
many details

thanks for the tip, I'll check that!

anyways I'll rather preallocate files fully for now, it takes a lot of time, but
should be the safest way before we know what exactly is wrong.. and I'll also
avoid creating such huge filesystems, as it leads to more trouble.. (like needs of huge
amounts of RAM for fs repair)
