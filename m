That is my understanding. I had similar questions when first passing
through the covering code and realizing the detection of the covering
commit was sort of implicit in and of itself (hence the additional state
checking and iclogs_changed logic). I think the bigger picture with
regard to this series was that it doesn't really matter because nothing
else is happening during quiesce, but I might revisit that from the
background covering perspective now that I have a better handle on how
the covering mechanism works...
