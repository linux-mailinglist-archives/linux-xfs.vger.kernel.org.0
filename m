- resv->total_dablks = XFS_DAENTER_BLOCKS(mp, XFS_ATTR_FORK); 

  This gives the number of dabtree blocks that we might need to allocate. If
  we do indeed allocate resv->total_dablks worth of blocks then it would mean
  that we would have split blocks from the root node to the leaf node of the
  dabtree. We would then need to log the following blocks,
  - Blocks belonging to the original path from root node to the leaf node.
  - The new set of blocks from the root node to the leaf node which resulted
    from splitting the corresponding blocks in the original path.
  Thus the number of blocks to be logged is 2 * resv->total_dablks.

- Double split
  If the size of the xattr is large enough to cause another split, then we
  would need yet another set of new blocks for representing the path from root
  to the leaf.  This is taken into consideration by 'resv->total_dablks *= 2'.
  These new blocks might also need to logged. So resv->log_dablks should be
  incremented by number of blocks b/w root node and the leaf. I now feel that
  the statement could be rewritten in the following manner, 'resv->log_dablks
  += XFS_DAENTER_BLOCKS(mp, XFS_ATTR_FORK)' if that makes it easier to
  understand.

Log reservation calculation for xattr set operation in XFS is
incorrect because,

- xfs_attr_set() computes the total log space reservation as the
  sum of 
  1. Mount time log reservation (M_RES(mp)->tr_attrsetm.tr_logres)
     Here, XFS incorrectly includes the number of blocks from root
     node to the leaf of a dabtree. This is incorrect because the
     number of such paths (from root node to leaf) depends on the
     size of the xattr. If the xattr is local but large enough to
     cause a double split then we would need three times the
     number of blocks in a path from root node to leaf. Hence the
     number of dabtree blocks that need to be logged is something
     that cannot be calculated at mount time.

     Also, the mount log reservation calcuation does not account
     for log space required for logging the AGF.
     
  2. Run time log reservatation
     This is calculated by multiplying two components,
     - The first component consists of sum of the following
       - Superblock
       - The number of bytes for logging a single path from root
         to leaf of a bmbt tree.
     - The second component consists of,
       - The number of dabtree blocks
       - The number of bmbt blocks required for mapping new
         dabtree blocks.
     Here Bmbt blocks gets accounted twice. Also it does not make sense to
     multiply these two components.

The other bug is related to calcuation performed in
xfs_log_calc_max_attrsetm_res(),
1. The call to XFS_DAENTER_SPACE_RES() macro returns the number of
   blocks required for a single split of dabtree and the
   corresponding number of bmbt blocks required for mapping the new
   dabtree blocks.
2. The space occupied by the attribute value is treated as if it
   were a remote attribute and the space for it along with the
   corresponding bmbt blocks required is added to the number of
   blocks obtained in step 1.
3. This sum is then multiplied with the runtime reservation. Here
   again Bmbt blocks gets accounted twice, once from the 'run time
   reservation' and the other from the call to
   XFS_DAENTER_SPACE_RES().
4. The result from step 3 is added to 'mount time log
   reservation'. This means that the log space reservation is
   accounted twice for dabtree blocks.

To solve these problems, the fix consists of,
1. Mounting time log reservation now includes only
   - Inode
   - Superblock
   - AGF
   i.e. we don't consider the dabtree logging space requirement
   when calculating mount time log reservation.

2. Run time log reservation
   To calculate run time log reservation we change xfs_attr_calc_size()
   to return, 
   1. Number of Dabtree blocks required.
   2. Number of Dabtree blocks that might need to be logged.
   3. Number of remote blocks.
   4. Number of Bmbt blocks that might be required.

   The values returned by xfs_attr_calc_size() is used by 
   - xfs_attr_set()
     - To compute total number of blocks required for attr set operation.
     - To compute the total log reservation (via a call to
       xfs_calc_attr_res()).
       - This uses dabtree blocks and bmbt blocks as input to calculate
         log space reservation for free space trees.
       - The total log space reservation is then computed by
         adding up 
         - Mount time log reservation space.
	 - dabtree blocks that need to logged and 
	 - free space tree blocks required.
   - xfs_log_calc_max_attrsetm_res()
     - To compute the log reservation space for a maximum sized local xattr.
       It uses the helper function xfs_calc_attr_res() accomplish this.
	  
   i.e. xfs_attr_calc_size() is now a helper function which
   returns various sizes (dabtree blocks, dabtree blocks that
   need to be logged, bmbt blocks, and remote blocks) that could be used by
   other functions (xfs_attr_set() and xfs_log_calc_max_attrsetm_res()) to
   obtain various block reservation values associated with xattrs.

One of the cleanups included in this patch was the addition of
xfs_calc_attr_res() function so that the reservation code is limited to
xfs_trans_resv.c.

Please let me know if the above explaination does not answer your question
satisfactorily.
