I thought about that first, but I really, really dislike sprinkling
magic "+ 1" corrections into the code to address non-obvious
unexplained off-by-one problems.

Yup, and that's exactly the problem I had with doing this - it
relies on the implicit behaviour that by moving last byte of a block
to the first byte of the next block, round_up() won't change the end
offset.  i.e. the correct functioning of the code is just as
non-obvious with a magic "+ 1" as the incorrect functioning was
without it.

Look at it this way: I didn't realise it was wrong when I wrote the
code, and I couldn't find the bug round_up() introduced when reading
the code even after the problem had been bisected to this exact
change. The code I wrote is bad, and adding a magic "+ 1" to fix the
bug doesn't make the code any better.

Given this is a slow path, so I see no point in optimising the code
for efficiency. IMO, clarity of the logic and calculation being made
is far more important - obviously correct logic is better than
relying on the effect of a magic "+ 1" on some other function to
acheive the same thing....

Cheers,

Dave.
