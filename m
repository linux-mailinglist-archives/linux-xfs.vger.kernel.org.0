I'm sure.. :P Note that the first patch was more smaller tweaks and
refactoring with the existing model in mind. For the set path, the
challenge IMO is to make the code generally more readable. I think the
remove path accomplishes this for the most part because the states and
whatnot are fairly low overhead on top of the existing complexity. This
changes considerably for the set path, not so much due to the mechanism
but because the baseline code is so fragmented and complex from the
start. I am slightly concerned that bolting state management onto the
current code as such might make it harder to grok and clean up after the
fact, but I could be wrong about that (my hope was certainly for the
opposite).

Regardless, that had me shifting focus a bit and playing around with the
current upstream code as opposed to shifting around your code. ISTM that
there is some commonality across the various set codepaths and perhaps
there is potential to simplify things notably _before_ applying the
state management scheme. I've appended a new diff below (based on
for-next) that starts to demonstrate what I mean. Note again that this
is similarly fast and loose as I've knowingly threw away some quirks of
the code (i.e. leaf buffer bhold) for the purpose of quickly trying to
explore/POC whether the factoring might be sane and plausible.

In summary, this combines the "try addname" part of each xattr format to
fall under a single transaction rolling loop such that I think the
resulting function could become one high level state. I ran out of time
for working through the rest, but from a read through it seems there's
at least a chance we could continue with similar refactoring and
reduction to a fewer number of generic states (vs. more format-specific
states). For example, the remaining parts of the set operation all seem
to have something along the lines of the following high level
components:

- remote value block allocation (and value set)
- if rename == true, clear flag and done
- if rename == false, flip flags
	- remove old xattr (i.e., similar to xattr remove)

... where much of that code looks remarkably similar across the
different leaf/node code branches. So I'm curious what you and others
following along might think about something like this as an intermediate
step...
