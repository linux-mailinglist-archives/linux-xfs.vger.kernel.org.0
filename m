Ok, interesting. I guess it would be nice if we had a test that somehow
or another more effectively exercised this codepath.

I know it waits on the work to complete. I poked around a bit for an
interface to "kick" a workqueue, so to speak (as opposed to flush), but
I didn't see anything (not surprisingly, since it probably wouldn't be a
broadly useful mechanism).

That aside, where would this wait on the CIL to flush to disk? AFAICT
the only thing that might happen here is log buffer submission. That
only happens when the log buffer is full (regardless of the current CIL
push writing its commit record). In fact if we did wait on I/O anywhere
in here, then that suggests potential problems with async log force.

Yes, I'm just exploring potential to reuse this code..

It looks to me that occurs regardless of whether there's a return
statement or not. AFAICT, this branching aready happens in the fast exit
path of this function as well as for the queue_work() branch. So if it
matters that much, perhaps the rest of the function should change
appropriately..

Hasn't the [un]likely() stuff been considered bogus for a while now?

Either way, we're already under spinlock at this point so this isn't a
fast exit path. We're talking about branching to an exit path that
still requires a function call (i.e. branch) to unlock the spinlock
before we return. Combine that with the rest of the function and I'm
having a hard time seeing how the factoring affects performance in
practice. Maybe it does, but I guess I'd want to see some data to grok
that the very least.

Fair enough, it's not technically a problem with this patch.

I don't see any reasoning about why this implementation was chosen over
a hard limit in the commit log description (of this patch or the
previous version). FWIW, I think it makes perfect sense to include it in
the commit log description.

I generally don't find value in code comments that explain why we didn't
do X or Y in code that ultimately does Z (that kind of thing belongs in
the commit log description IMO), but if somebody finds the content
useful then it's not a big deal to me.
