Hmm, yeah.. the inode chunk allocation code in particular can make
multiple attempts at xfs_alloc_vextent() before the higher level
operation ultimately fails.

Seems reasonable to me in general..

Any reason this is reinitialized only when the caller doesn't care about
alignment? This seems more like something that should be reset on each
allocation call..

BTW I'm also wondering if this is something that could be isolated to a
single location by looking at perag state instead of plumbing the logic
through the allocator args (which is already a mess). I guess we no
longer have the allocator's perag reference once we're back in the inode
allocation code, but the xfs_ialloc_ag_select() code does use a perag to
filter out AGs without enough space. I wonder if that's enough to assume
alignment is the problem if we attempt a chunk allocation and it
ultimately fails..? We could also just consider looking at the perag
again in xfs_dialloc() if the allocation fails, since it looks like we
still have a reference there.

Perhaps this should be ratelimited vs. printed once? I suppose there's
not much value in continuing to print it once an fs is in this inode
-ENOSPC state, but the tradeoff is that if the user clears the state and
maybe runs into it again sometime later without a restart, they might
not see the message and think it's something else. (What about hitting
the same issue across multiple mounts, btw?). I suppose the ideal
behavior would be to print once and never again until an inode chunk has
been successfully allocated (or the system reset)..?
