I originally had that and while the code looked kinda weird
opencoding an ophdr everywhere we wanted the size of a start record,
that wasn't an issue. The biggest problem was that using a boolean
resulted in _several_ logic bugs that I only tracked down once I
realised I'd forgotten to replace existing the start record size
variable that now wasn't initialised inside the inner loop.

So, yes, it gets converted to a boolean inside that function call,
but I think the code in this set of nested loops is more reliable if
it carries the size of the structure rather than open coding it
everywhere. Making it a boolean doesn't improve the readability of
the code at all.

Ok.

Cheers,
