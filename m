That is not required functionality - it is an implementation
optimisation.

WRITE_ZEROES requires that the subsequent write must not need to
perform filesystem metadata updates to guarantee data integrity.
How the filesystem implements that is up to the filesystem....

No, it is not like the current glibc posix_fallocate() fallback.
That is a compatibility slow-path, not an IO path performance
optimisation.

i.e. WRITE_ZEROES is for applications that overwrite in place and
are very sensitive to IO latency.  The zeroing is done
in a context that is not performance sensitive, and it results in
much lower long tail latencies in the performance sensitive IO
paths.

WRITE_ZEROES is a more efficient way of running
FALLOC_FL_ALLOC_RANGE and then writing zeroes to convert the range
from unwritten to written extents because it allows ithe kernel to
use hardware offloads if they are available.

Applications that need pure overwrite behaviour are not going to be
using COW files or storage that requires always-COW IO paths in the
filesystems (e.g. on zoned storage hardware).

Hence we just don't care that:

... COW files cannot support WRITE_ZEROES functionality because
optimisations for overwrite-in-place aren't valid for COW-based
IO...

Ah, that's not a "zeroing fallocate()" like was suggested. These are
the existing FALLOC_FL_ALLOCATE_RANGE file extension semantics.

AFAICT, this is exactly what the proposed patch implements - it
short circuits the bit we can't guarantee (ENOSPC prevention via
preallocation) but retains all the other aspects (non-destructive
truncate up) when it returns success.

I don't see how a glibc posix_fallocate() fallback that does a
non-desctructive truncate up though some new interface is any better
than just having the filesystem implement ALLOCATE_RANGE without the
ENOSPC guarantees in the first place?

Yes. However:

	fallocate(fd, FALLOC_FL_WRITE_ZEROES, old_eof, new_eof - old_eof);

is exactly the "zeroing truncate up" operation that was being
suggested. It will not overwrite any existing data, except if the
application is racing other file extension operations with this one.
In which case, the application is buggy, not the fallocate() code.
