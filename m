Hi Linus,

Can you please pull the changes for XFS from the tag below? I
apologise for not sending this rather large update much earlier in
the merge window; we had a late regression report which uncovered a
serious omission from our regular test matrix. Determining the
seriousness of the problems that followup testing then uncovered
delayed the pull request. The most likely problem that anyone would
see was the original regression that was reported, and that is fixed
in this pull request.

That said, we know that there are still unfixed regressions that
this addition testing has uncovered, but they are all in relatively
niche configurations so shouldn't impact the majority of people
running 6.3 kernels. I will follow up with another pull request to
address these issues either late in the remaining merge window
period or soon after -rc1 is released.

This tree consists mainly of online scrub functionality and the
design documentation for the upcoming online repair functionality
built on top of the scrub code. I explicitly choose to use fine
grained merges for that series to retain all the context/cover
letter information for each part of the series that Darrick had
included in the tags for his pull requests. While it means there are
lots of merge commits, it also means the context and some of the
reasoning behind the series of changes is kept in the git tree with
the rest of the code history.

The tree at the tag below merges cleanly with your tree as of a few
minutes ago (head commit f20730efbd30), but results in a slightly
different diffstat to the pull request below. i.e.

pull-req:
 85 files changed, 10520 insertions(+), 1890 deletions(-)

merge into your tree:
 85 files changed, 10550 insertions(+), 1920 deletions(-)

I have confirmed that the resultant merge into your tree ends up
with identical code in fs/xfs after ignoring the few changes to the
XFS code that are already in your tree (mm_account_reclaimed_pages,
FMODE_DIO_PARALLEL_WRITE, sysctl table cleanup, .filemap update and
posix acl changes), so it doesn't look like the difference in the
diffstat is anything to worry about. If you see anything different,
please let me know!

-Dave.

  xfs: fix livelock in delayed allocation at ENOSPC (2023-04-27 09:02:11 +1000)

----------------------------------------------------------------
xfs: New code for 6.4

o Added detailed design documentation for the upcoming online repair feature
o major update to online scrub to complete the reverse mapping cross-referencing
  infrastructure enabling us to fully validate allocated metadata against owner
  records. This is the last piece of scrub infrastructure needed before we can
  start merging online repair functionality.
o Fixes for the ascii-ci hashing issues
o deprecation of the ascii-ci functionality
o on-disk format verification bug fixes
o various random bug fixes for syzbot and other bug reports
