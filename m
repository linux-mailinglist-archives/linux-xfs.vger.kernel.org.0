To my earlier point... please just don't call this fixed mount value
"set_aside" if that's not what it actually is. Rename the field and
helper to something self-descriptive based on whatever fixed components
it's made up of (you could even qualify it as a subcomponent of
set_aside with something like ".._agfl_bmap_set_aside" or whatever) then
reserve the _set_aside() name for the helper that calculates and
documents what the actual/final/dynamic "set aside" value is.
