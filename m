Yes, that tells me that the device can be configured for dax. Not if the
filesystem will use it.

Or the bock size does not match page size. Or whatever other requirement
the filesystem might have is not met.

No, it is not the case. That is why it would make sense for the kernel
to make the information about DAX availability accessible somewhere.

See, it is not property of the block device. It is property of the mount
point. The availability on the device is one requirement but the
filesystem options affect availability to the user in the end.

Or the kernel could just tell the user. But right, information is power,
and keeping the user in the dark is much more entertaining.

OK

I guess I have exhausted sane discussion options here.
