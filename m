Well, in the last version of the set, I did keep it around, but it was 
so small, Darrick suggested cleaning it out all together.  Here is the 
same patch in the last set:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11231511/

Maybe when more folks get back from break they can chime in about 
keeping it or not.  I think I commented pretty well on "monster 
function" in the last patch.  It is in all in the pursuit of pulling 
things up and then breaking them back down again.

I always assumed it to be a figure of speech in reference to factoring 
out common code, sort of like how one might factor out a common 
denominator or common multiple from an algebraic expression. If it 
really bothers folks though, I don't mind changing it.
