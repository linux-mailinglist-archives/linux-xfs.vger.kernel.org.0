No, it's good. See my rant emails.

Case insensitivity is a subject near and dear to my heart.

And when I say "near and dear to my heart", I obviously mean "I
despise it, and I have spent _decades_ ranting against it and trying
to explain why it's a problem".

I've ranted against it before, but it's been probably a decade since I
needed to. I was hoping this was long behind us.

I'm surprised people still think it's even acceptable.

FAT isn't known for being a great filesystem. HFS+ was garbage, but
even Apple eventually got the message and tried to make APFS better.
I'm not sure Apple succeeded (maybe the case insensitivity is still
the default on OS X, but apparently at least iOS got the message).

Every single case-insensitive filesystem in the world HAS BEEN CRAP.
Please. Learn from literally decades of reality, and stop doing it.

And if you have to do it for some legacy reason, at least understand
the problems with it. Understand that you DO NOT KNOW what the user
space locale is.

Limiting yourself to US-ASCII is at least technically valid. Because
EBCDIC isn't worth worrying about.  But when the high bit is set, you
had better not touch it, or you need to limit it spectacularly.
