Ok, I can see what this is doing, but the code is nasty - zeroing
info.stat via *stat = 0, then having
xfs_rmap_lookup_le_range_helper() modify *stat via info.stat and
then relying on that implicit update to skip the very next if
(!(*stat)) clause is not very nice.

xfs_rmap_lookup_le_range_helper() returns -ECANCELED when it's
found a match, so we can use this rather than relying on *stat
to determine what to do:

	error = xfs_rmap_lookup_le(cur, bno, owner, offset, flags, irec, stat);
	if (error)
		return error;

	info.irec = irec;
	info.stat = 0;
	if (*stat)
		error = xfs_rmap_lookup_le_range_helper(cur, irec, &info);
	if (!error)
		error = xfs_rmap_query_range(cur, &info.high, &info.high,
				xfs_rmap_lookup_le_range_helper, &info);
	if (error == -ECANCELED)
		error = 0;

	*stat = info.stat;
....

Cheers,

Dave.
