Sorry, I/O wait might matter for what?

I'm really not sure what you're objecting to - you've hand-waved
about hardware that doesn't need cache flushes twice now and
inferred that they'd be adversely affected by removing cache
flushes. That just doesn't make any sense at all, and I have numbers
to back it up.

You also asked what storage it improved performance on and I told
you and then also pointed out all the software layers that it
massively helps, too, regardless of the physical storage
characteristics.

I have numbers to back it up. You did not reply to me, so I'm not
going to waste time repeating myself here.

> What is the argument against making this conditional?

There is no argument for making this conditional. You've created an
undefined strawman and are demanding that I prove it wrong. If
you've got anything concrete, then tell us about it directly and
provide numbers.

Cheers,

Dave.
