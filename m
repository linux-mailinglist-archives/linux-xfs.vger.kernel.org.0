Looks good, couple of minor nits you can take or leave.

This is better done as

		if (err2 && !error)
			.....

Because we only care about the value of error if err2 is non zero.
Hence for normal operation where there are no errors, checking err2
first is less code to execute as error never needs to be checked...
