Heh, that should've been dirent_name[179:254].

Update:

After some subtle prodding from Dave, I realized that there's a simpler
solution to this problem: extend the xattr match predicate to check both
the xattr name /and/ the xattr value.  Parent pointers cannot be remote
format because the amount of data are never larger than 3/4 of 1FSB, so
the value of an ATTR_PARENT attribute is always immediately available.

The pptr ondisk format becomes one of:

    (parent_ino, parent_gen, dirent_name) -> NULL
    (parent_ino, parent_gen, dirent_name[0:242]) -> (dirent_name[243:254])

Matching on both xattr name and value is only useful* for parent
pointers, so I introduced a new XFS_DA_OP_VLOOKUP flag to gate this new
mode.  No more sha512 in the attr name, no more worrying about collision
resistance of sha*, and one less dependency for xfs.

The next challenge was to log the VLOOKUP flag when we're doing xattr
operations and to recover that state when replaying an ATTRI log item.
This I did by creating new "NV" variants of ATTRI_OP_FLAGS_{SET,REMOVE}.
The NVSET and NVREMOVE opcodes require VLOOKUP, and NVREMOVE can log
an xattr value buffer.  Since parent pointers is an unmerged incompat
feature, we don't need a new log-incompat feature to protect them.

The last thing was to update NVREPLACE so that we can handle rename
operations.  Here too we need VLOOKUPs, but I also needed to log both
the old value and the new value, so I changed the attri ondisk format.
For NVREPLACE, the old and new name lengths are two u16 overlaid atop
the alfi_name_len field; and the new value length is a u32 that replaces
the old pad (and what Allison called alfi_nname_len).

I'm going to run QA on this over the weekend, and figure out how to
collapse this patchset with the new one.  I'll rebase the whole branch
on pptrs v10 whenever it comes out.

--D

* Unless someone has a usecase for cmpxchg of extended attributes?
