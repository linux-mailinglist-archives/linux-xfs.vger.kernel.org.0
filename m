*nod*

The change is not useful anymore as a result of folding in your
previous suggestions. I'll revert it.

That was one of your previous suggestions :)

I'll push it back up one patch into the cleanup patch and leave this
as an optimisation only patch.

Agreed - the next patch does that with the reversal of the search
order. The end result is what you're asking for, so I'll leave this
alone for now....

I hadn't noticed that - I was more concerned with ending up with
readable code :)
