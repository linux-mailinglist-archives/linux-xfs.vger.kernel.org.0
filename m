Add the fs_context_operations method .reconfigure that performs
remount validation as previously done by the super_operations
.remount_fs method.

An attempt has also been made to update the comment about options
handling problems with mount(8) to reflect the current situation.

+/*
+ * There have been problems in the past with options passed from mount(8).
+ *
+ * The problem being that options passed by mount(8) in the case where only
+ * the the mount point path is given would consist of the existing fstab
+ * options with the options from mtab for the current mount merged in and
+ * the options given on the command line last. But the result couldn't be
+ * relied upon to accurately reflect the current mount options so that
+ * rejecting options that can't be changed on reconfigure could erronously
+ * cause mount failure.
+ *
+ * The mount-api uses a legacy mount options handler in the VFS to handle
+ * mount(8) so these options will continue to be passed. Even if mount(8)
+ * is updated to use fsopen()/fsconfig()/fsmount() it's likely to continue
+ * to set the existing options so options problems with reconfigure could
+ * continue.
+ *
+ * For the longest time mtab locking was a problem and this could have been
+ * one possible cause. It's also possible there could have been options
+ * order problems.
+ *
+ * That has changed now as mtab is a link to the proc file system mount
+ * table so mtab options should be always accurate.
+ *
+ * Consulting the util-linux maintainer (Karel Zak) he is confident that,
+ * in this case, the options passed by mount(8) will be those of the current
+ * mount and the options order should be a correct merge of fstab and mtab
+ * options, and new options given on the command line.
+ *
+ * So, in theory, it should be possible to compare incoming options and
+ * return an error for options that differ from the current mount and can't
+ * be changed on reconfigure to prevent users from believing they might have
+ * changed mount options using remount which can't be changed.
+ *
+ * But for now continue to return success for every reconfigure request, and
+ * silently ignore all options that can't actually be changed.
