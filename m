I can't say I've seen it for a long time now - I want to say "years"
but I may well have simply missed it on the rare occasion it has
occurred and fstests hasn't captured it. i.e. fstests is supposed to
capture unusual things like this appearing in dmesg during a
test....

Yeah - xlog_verify_grant_tail() will the report reservation
overruns, but the serious log space problems (i.e. head overwritting
the tail) are detected by xlog_verify_tail_lsn() when we stamp the
tail_lsn into the current iclog header. That's still done under the
icloglock and the AIL lock, so the comparison of the tail with the
current log head is still completely serialised.

You can test that just by removing the XLOG_TAIL_WARN flag setting,
then it will warn on every reservation overrun rather than just the
first.

Well, it's fundamentally an unserialised check, so it can race with
other reservation grants, commits that release grant space and tail
lsn updates. Hence it's not a 100% reliable debug check.

It also used to be run at all times, not just under
XFS_CONFIG_DEBUG=y, which is why it has a panic tag associated with
it. When we first deployed it, we weren't 100% sure there weren't
customer workloads that would trip over this and hang the log, so
we gave ourselves a way of triggering kernel dumps the instant an
overrun was detected. Hence a site that had log hangs with this
message in the logs could turn on the panic tag and we'd get a
kernel dump to analyse...

Since then, this code has been relegated to debug code but the panic
tag still exists. It could be turned back into a ASSERT now, but
it's still useful the way it is as it means debug kernels don't fall
over the moment a spurious overrun occurs...

Cheers,

Dave.
