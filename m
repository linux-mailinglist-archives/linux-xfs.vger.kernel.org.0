Indeed, the xfs_force_shutdown is a no-op both for the old and this
new check.

Now the real question, which is a bit out of scope for this patch is
why we even have XLOG_STATE_IOERROR?  Wouldn't it make more sense
to just user the shutdown flag in the mount structure and avoid the
extra state complexity and thus clean up this whole mess?
