I don't think you need to take it away in this patch. What I'm
suggesting is breaking existing code into something like this:

int
__xfs_attr_rmtval_remove()
{
	...
	error = xfs_bunmapi(...);
	...

	if (!done)
		return -EAGAIN;

	...
}

int
xfs_attr_rmtval_remove()
{
	error = xfs_attr_rmtval_invalidate();

	do {
		error = __xfs_attr_rmtval_remove();
		...
		xfs_defer_finish();
		...
		xfs_trans_roll_inode(...);
	} while (-EAGAIN);

	...
}

So we can continue to use both as needed without duplication and remove
the bits that become unused as the series progresses. Eventually we
could rename __xfs_attr_rmtval_remove() back to xfs_attr_rmtval_remove()
to maintain that it's essentially the same function and only the
transaction rolling bits are being factored out and eventually removed.
