<shrug> For boolean flags that don't change value in the function body
I'd rather they be initialized at declaration time so that code
maintainers don't have to remember if a variable is initialized or not.
need_inactive has scope and a valid value wherever you are in the
function body.

So far in my evaluation, deferred inactivation has improved reclaim
behavior because evict_inodes can push all eligible inodes all the way
to IRECLAIMABLE without getting stuck behind xfs_inactive, and the
shrinker can free other cached inodes sooner.  I think we're still
mostly reliant on xfs_inode_alloc looping when memory is low to throttle
the size of the inode cache, since I think mass deletions are what push
the inodegc code the hardest.  If reclaim can't free inodes fast enough,
I think that means the AIL is running slowly, in which case both
frontend and background workers will block on the log.

There's no direct link between the shrinker and the inodegc worker,
which means that it can't push the inodegc worker to get even more
inodes to IRECLAIMABLE.  I've played with racing directory tree
deletions of a filesystem with 8M inodes against fsstress on VMs with
512M of memory, but so far I haven't been able to drive the system into
OOM any more easily than I could before this patch.  The unlink calls
seem to get stuck under xfs_iget, like I expect.

The VFS still has this (erroneous) notion that calling ->destroy_inode
will directly reclaim inodes from XFS, but the only difference from
today's code is that it can take longer for inodes to get to that state.
To fix that, I've also thought about making xfs_fs_free_cached_objects
requeue the inodegc worker immediately (but without waiting for it), but
so far I haven't needed to do that to avoid trouble.

It's an optimization to avoid stalling quotaoff on NEEDS_INACTIVE
inodes.  This means that quotaoff can now cause the background inodegc
worker to have to loop again, but seeing as quotaoff can pin the log
tail, I decided that was a reasonable tradeoff.
How does this rewording sound to you?

I've gotten a lot of use out of the tracepoints to debug all sorts of
weird mis-interactions between freeze, remounts, and the inodegc worker.

The bitflag isn't racy, though why isn't obvious.  There are seven
places where we change the INODEGC_RUNNING state:

- For freeze and ro remount, the VFS will take s_umount before calling
  into XFS, and XFS then calls inodegc_flush to complete all the queued
  work before changing the bit state.

  During the v6 review Dave wondered if we even needed the INODEGC
  RUNNING flag, and I concluded that we need it for freeze, since we
  allow inodes to sleep under xfs_inactive() while trying to allocate a
  transaction.  Under the new scheme, inodes can be queued for
  inactivation on a frozen fs, but we need xfs_inodegc_queue to know not
  to kick the worker without having to mess around with VFS locks to
  check the freeze state.

- For thaw and rw remount, the VFS takes s_umount and calls XFS, which
  re-enables the worker.

- Mount and unmount run in isolation (since we can't have any open files
  on the filesystem) so there won't be any other threads trying to call
  into the filesystem.

- I think xchk_{start,stop}_reaping is racy though.  That code probably
  has to sb_start_write to prevent freeze or ro remount from messing
  with the INODEGC_RUNNING state.  That would still leave a hole if
  fscounters scrub races with a rw remount and immediately files start
  getting deleted, but maybe that's just not worth worrying about.
  Scrub will try again a few times, and in djwong-dev I solve that by
  freezing the filesystem if the unlocked fscounters scrub fails.
