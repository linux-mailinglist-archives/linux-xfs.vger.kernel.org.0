I think it's reasonable for a test focused on various arguments/modes of
an application to do such things. If that's the intent here, that just
wasn't clear to me from the current construction of the tests. I.e., it
seems to me there's a mix of testing feature functionality, feature
compatibility and various params etc. that makes it difficult to
determine the purpose of the test (or more specifically, the difference
in purpose between the two). Perhaps further separation will make things
more clear.

Heh, I barely have enough time for meaningful development work as it is.
I generally don't use or test realtime. Any time I've played with it in
the past it's been pretty much broken.

I do occasionally take a similar approach for logging and/or shutdown
functionality because the tests that tend to trigger problems in such
code don't do so on-demand. So inevitably things break over time, QE
finds a problem in one of the associated stress tests that usually takes
a while to reproduce, and then one or more of those related tests end up
reproducing multiple similar problems. I'll usually try to use that as
an opportunity to run those tests in the background for a couple weeks
or so and try to work through any issues that might have creeped in
since the last go around. I don't mind trying to incorporate more
external log testing in those sequences if that would be of help.
