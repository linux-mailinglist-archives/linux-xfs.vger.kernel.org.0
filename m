I'd rather make this function static to inode.c and export a const
global struct xchk_meta_ops pointing to this function.  There's really
no need for the external declaration aside from populating the
meta_scrub_ops table in scrub.c.  The reason why I haven't done that
already is that doing that cleanup will likely cause ~23 merge conflicts
all the way down the branch as I add online repair functions.  Perhaps
the next time I make a branchwide change.

Second, xchk_setup_inode doesn't necessarily return a cached inode,
which is what most iget functions do -- if the read fails, it'll lock
the AGI buffer to the scrub transaction.

I haven't any strong objections to renaming this
xchk_setup_inode_record, if that's what's needed to get this patchset
through review.

I'll make this change, however.
