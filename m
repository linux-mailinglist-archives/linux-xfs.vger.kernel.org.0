FWIW I patched xfs_check out of fstests years ago.

Once Eric merges the large(ish) pile of xfs_repair patches I sent him
for 5.10 I think we'll be at the point where there aren't any
corruptions caught by xfs_check but not by xfs_repair.

Soon I'll also submit my rewrite of the fstests fuzzer code to Eryu, and
when that lands upstream then the rest of you will be able to check my
assertion.

Assuming none of you find new coverage holes that I didn't, we will
finally be able to drop xfs_check (which is bitrotting) from fstests
entirely.
