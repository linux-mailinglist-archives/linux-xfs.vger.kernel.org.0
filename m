I noticed it while I was running the freespace defrag code in djwong-dev
with tracepoints turned on.  THere was a math bug that I was trying to
sort out that resulted in FUNSHARE being called on a hole, and I was
surprised that it would create a delalloc reservation and then convert
it to an unwritten extent instead of going straight to an unwritten
extent.

AFAICT it has no user visible effect other than not wasting cycles on
pointless work.
