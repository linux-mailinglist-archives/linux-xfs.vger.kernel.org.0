Pretty much.. it's mostly just breaking the assumption that the task
that allocates a log ticket is necessarily the one that acquires log
reservation (or regrants it). The purpose of this change is so that any
particular task could allocate (and reserve) a relog ticket and donate
it to the relog mechanism (a separate task) for use (i.e. to roll it).

I think we've discussed this in the past, though I'm not clear on
whether it rely on this sort of change. Either way, there's a big
difference in scope between the tweak made by this patch and the design
of a generic async XFS front-end. :)
