Similarly, this fell off my radar screen once the three of us started
lobbing log refactoring patchsets at each other. :)

AFAICT the goal of the WSYNC/DIRSYNC logic is basically to annotate the
transaction to say "sysadmin wants all (write|namespace) operations to
commit synchronously", so at first I was a little surprised that this
added a flags argument to xfs_trans_commit instead of adding a couple of
flags to capture the "I'm a write op" or  "I'm a namespace op" to
xfs_trans_alloc.

/Then/ I realized that xfs_trans_alloc lets you set t_flags directly
with almost no validation and died a little inside.  Then it occurred
to me that maybe this is deliberately done just prior to the final
commit so that the intermediate transaction rolls are not committed
synchronously, just one big log force at the end.

/And then/ I noticed that in the places where we set SYNC just prior to
xfs_trans_commit, each deferred op that gets run via xfs_trans_commit's
call to xfs_defer_finish_noroll blocks waiting for xfs_log_force_lsn,
when we could probably get away with only forcing the log at the very
end of the transaction chain.

So, uh, my question is, would it make more sense to (a) create a
separate trans_alloc flags namespace so that (b) we can add the
wsync/dirsync annotations from the outset, while keeping in mind that
(c) we could possibly let the intermediate transaction rolls commit in
the usual asynchronous fashion so long as the last one forces the log?
