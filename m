Ok, I spent half the day prototyping this and it passes basic sanity
checks:

http://git.infradead.org/users/hch/misc.git/shortlog/refs/heads/xfs-multiple-delwri-lists

My conclusions from that is:

 1) it works
 2) I think it is the right to do
 3) it needs a lot more work
 4) we can't block the online repair work on it

so I guess we'll need to go with the approach in this patch for now,
maybe with a better commit log, and I'll look into finishing this work
some time in the future.
