It's true, a snapshot created with these patches will not have their unlinked
inodes processed if mounted on an older kernel. I'm not sure how much of a
problem that is; the filesystem is not inconsistent, but some space is lost,
I guess. I'm not sure it's common to take a snapshot of a frozen filesystem on
one kernel and then move it back to an older kernel.  Maybe others have
thoughts on this.
