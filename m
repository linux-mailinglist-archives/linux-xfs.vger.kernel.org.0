Even that isn't stating the whole truth. b_maps[0].bm_bn contains
the current daddr for all buffers, regardless of whether they are
cached or not. This is what the IO path uses to provide the physical
address for the bio we submit...

Looking at the kernel code, there is still a lot of users of
bp->b_bn, and we've still got inconsistent use of XFS_BUF_ADDR, too.
I think fixing this all up needs a separate patchset - there's relatively
little outside libxfs/ in userspace that uses bp->b_bn directly
(largely repair, which is a 50/50 mix of b_bn and XFS_BUF_ADDR(bp))
so we should be able to clean this up entirely.

I suspect that converting all the external users to a
xfs_buf_daddr(bp) helper is the way to go here, and then renaming
b_bn to something else and use it only in xfs_buf.c for cache
indexing...

I'll put together another patchset to clean this up - it's separate
to the mount features rework, and this patch is only here because
when I change the feature check in the || case of this check to use
mount flags, the primary superblock buffer verification on first
read no longer flags CRC errors....

Cheers,

Dave.
