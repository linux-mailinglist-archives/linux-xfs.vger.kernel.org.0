5.17-rc1 came out and I saw regressions across the board when xfs/049
and xfs/073 ran.

xfs/049 formats XFS on a block device, mounts it, creates a sparse file
inside the XFS fs, formats the sparse file, mounts that (via automatic
loop device), does some work, and then unmounts both the sparse file
filesystem and the outer XFS filesystem.

The first unmount no longer waited for the loop device to release
asynchronously so the unmount of the outer fs fails because it's still
in use.

So this series fixes xfs/049, but xfs/073 is still broken.  xfs/073
creates a sparse file containing an XFS filesystem and then does this in
rapid succession:

mount -o loop <mount options that guarantee mount failure>
mount -o loop <mount options that should work>

Whereas with 5.16 this worked fine,

 [U] try mount 1
 loop0: detected capacity change from 0 to 83968
 XFS (loop0): Filesystem has duplicate UUID 924e8033-a130-4f9c-a11f-52f892c268e9 - can't mount
 [U] try mount 2
 loop0: detected capacity change from 0 to 83968
 XFS (loop0): Mounting V5 Filesystem
 XFS (loop0): resetting quota flags
 XFS (loop0): Ending clean mount

in 5.17-rc1 it fails like this:

 [U] try mount 1
 loop0: detected capacity change from 0 to 83968
 XFS (loop0): Filesystem has duplicate UUID 0b0afdac-5c9c-4d94-9b8d-fe85a2eb1143 - can't mount
 [U] try mount 2
 I/O error, dev loop0, sector 0 op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x1000 phys_seg 1 prio class 0
 XFS (loop0): SB validate failed with error -5.
 [U] fail mount 2

I guess this means that mount can grab the loop device after the backing
file has been released but before a new one has been plumbed in?  Or,
seeing the lack of "detected capacity change" for mount 2, maybe the
backing file never gets added?
