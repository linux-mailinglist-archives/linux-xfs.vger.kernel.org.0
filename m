Hmm, I suppose if the secondary sb scan didn't produce any usable values
then we could just try increasing powers of two until the computed
rootino value >= sb_rootino in the hopes of finding one.

I'm not sure how I feel about repair guessing values until it finds one
that shuts off the warning light, though.  Is doing so foolishness, or
is it AI? :)
