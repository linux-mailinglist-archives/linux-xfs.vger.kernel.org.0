I can follow up with a PATCH v1 to do this kernel level deduplication.
I focused my initial attempt at changing as little as possible.

The short answer is that the format strings need to be known at
compile time, as this printk index is added into a section of the
resultant ELF binary.

I can't really comment as to the commit history of the printk
indexing, though I think it's a fair criticism that there doesn't
currently seem to be any in-tree Documentation file about the
functionality yet.
The best references I could point to are commit
337015573718b161891a3473d25f59273f2e626b and this LWN article:
https://lwn.net/Articles/857148/

Your concern about ABI commitments is totally valid, and is (to me)
rather ironic in this context. This printk indexing effort was started
so that end user-operators can more reliably capture critical event
data *without* asking developers to commit to anything. The hope here
is that developers can change format strings and parameters at will,
and that from release-to-release end user-operators can compare the
printk index to see if there are any changes in printk index entries
that they care about for their environment.

It is my genuine hope that by merging a change like what I'm proposing
here, that end users can more reliably detect and react to XFS events
without XFS developers needing to know about this or commit to
anything. The only reason this change is needed is because XFS wraps
printk() for its own formatting.
