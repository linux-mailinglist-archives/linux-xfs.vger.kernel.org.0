Can we use another dummy parent inode value in xfs_repair? It looks to
me that we set it to zero in phase 4 if it fails verification and set
the parent to NULLFSINO (i.e. unknown) in repair's in-core tracking.
Phase 6 walks the directory entries and explicitly sets the parent inode
number of entries with an unknown parent (according to the in-core
tracking). IOW, I don't see where we actually rely on the directory
header having a parent inode of zero outside of detecting it in the
custom verifier. If that's the only functional purpose, I wonder if we
could do something like set the bogus parent field of a sf dir to the
root inode or to itself, that way the default verifier wouldn't trip
over it..
