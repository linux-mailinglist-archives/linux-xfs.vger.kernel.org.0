It's probably the best we can do.  Recover as far as everything validated
and then give up.

discard_zeroes_data was unfortunately always broken as no standard
gives you any such guarantee.  The best you get is a guarantee that
it returns zeroes if it actually deallocated the block, but if it
deallocates a given block or not is a black box.

If the device reports a queue/write_zeroes_max_bytes it supports a hardware
offload.  That could still write zeroes to the media if the device
is stupid enough, but hopefully not many are.
