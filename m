On further reflection, "filesystems can return ENOSPC at any time" is 
certainly something apps need to be prepared for (and in this case, it's 
doing the right thing, by logging the error and aborting), but it's not 
really a "not a bug" excuse for the filesystem in all circumstances (or 
this one?), is it? E.g. a write(fd, buf, 1) returning ENOSPC on an fresh 
filesystem would be considered a bug, no?

...or maybe your "suboptimal" was entirely tongue in cheek?

I decided to stop being lazy and look into taking the strace option 
further. I can script looking for the right process as it starts up, and 
with judicious use of "-Z" for failed calls only, and filtering out 
commonly failing syscalls (futex, stat etc.), the output volume is reduced 
to just about nothing. This could be the solution - but it'll probably 
take a week or so for it to fail again and see if I can catch what's going 
on.

Thanks for the inspiration / kick in the pants to get this going.

Strace has grown more options since the last time I looked at the man 
page: "-Z" is fantastic!

Cheers,

Chris
