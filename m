That's pretty much what this series does. It only modifies the generic
tests because I didn't want to mess with the others (all btrfs, I think)
that might not have any issues, but I wouldn't be opposed to burying the
logic into the dmlogwrites bits so it just always creates a thin volume
behind the scenes. If we were going to do that, I'd prefer to do it as a
follow up to these patches (dropping patch 1, most likely) so at least
they can remain enabled on XFS for the time being.

OTOH, perhaps the thinp behavior could be internal, but conditional
based on XFS. It's not really clear to me if this problem is more of an
XFS phenomenon or just that XFS happens to have some unique recovery
checking logic that explicitly detects it. It seems more like the
latter, but I don't know enough about ext4 or btrfs to say..

Do you mean BLKZEROOUT? I see that is more efficient than writing zeroes
from userspace, but I don't think it's efficient enough to solve this
problem. It takes about 3m to manually zero my 15GB lvm (dm-linear)
scratch device on my test vm via dd using sync writes. A 'blkdiscard -z'
saves me about half that time, but IIRC this is an operation that would
occur every time the logwrites device is replayed to a particular
recovery point (which can happen many times per test).
