I agree, FWIW. I've no issues with the original patch provided we fix up
the xfs_info behavior. I think the "historical behavior" argument is
reasonable, but at the same time how many people rely on the historical
behavior of updating the superblock? It's not like this changes the
mount api or anything. A user would just have to continue using the same
mount options to persist behavior.

Eric pointed out offline that we do refer to using the mount options to
"reset" su/sw in at least one place (repair?), but I don't see why we
couldn't rephrase that and/or provide a repair/admin script that updates
on-disk values. Still just my .02. :)
