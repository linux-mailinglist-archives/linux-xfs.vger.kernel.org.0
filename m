I'll have to come back and respond to your other reviews in depth later 
when I have a little more time, but I think responding to this one 
quickly will help answer a lot of questions.  The set actually has a lot 
more history as a delayed attributes series, and even more as parent 
pointers.  I try to keep the whole set up to date because parent 
pointers is sort of a good test case for the rest it.  And also because 
I want to make sure things still work for the future uses they are 
intended for.

To give you an idea, this is the same series + delayed attrs + parent pptrs:
https://github.com/allisonhenderson/xfs_work/tree/pptrs_restart41

I usually just send out the "delay ready" portion of it just to cut down 
on the amount of code that people have to review (because I know people 
are swamped with review backlog).  And also because some time ago, folks 
felt that trying to push it in all at once was a little unwieldy, so 
they requested that I chop it down to this sub series that focuses on 
refactor only with no functional change.  And then that would give it 
time to stabilize before proceeding too.

I hope the history of it helps a bit.  Otherwise I can see where it 
looks like a whole bunch of craziness for nothing, but that's the long 
term plan for it.  And while I think people agree that it's not the 
prettiest at the moment, the function that we are trying to achieve with 
it isn't simplest either, so people have been pretty active in shaping 
it as it goes along.  I'll go through your set and see which bits I can 
pick up and sort of integrate so that we don't have so much conflict. 
Thanks!

Allison
