Agreed, this needs to be a v5 feature bit.

If the current kernel ignores xattr leaf entries with namespaces it
doesn't know about, *then* this could be an rocompat feature.
Otherwise, it has to be incompat.

As it is, I think the attr list functions will return *every* xattr
regardless of namespace, so I think it's not safe to let old kernels
mount pptr filesystems even in readonly mode.
