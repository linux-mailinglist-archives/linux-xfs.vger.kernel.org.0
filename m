Not sure what you mean by caller state, but I kind of just view it as a
poorly named force scan (not that that's a better name). All that really
matters in this context is the non-force/sync/wait mode that is run by
the background scanner. Nothing prevents userspace from running a sync
scan via ioctl() whenever, so it's hard to assume behavior.

Also just a random thought.. you could consider something like a FLUSH
flag (and/or scan) if you wanted to be more selectively aggressive for
any of the -EDQUOT handling cases.

Thanks, makes sense. With that, I'd make _prep_free_cowblocks() look
more something like:

        /*
         * A cowblocks trim of an inode can have a significant effect on
         * fragmentation even when a reasonable COW extent size hint is set.
         * Therefore, we prefer to not process cowblocks unless they are clean
         * and idle. We can never process a cowblocks inode that is dirty or has
         * in-flight I/O under any circumstances, because outstanding writeback
         * or dio expects targeted COW fork blocks exist through write
         * completion where they can be remapped into the data fork.
         *
         * Therefore, the heuristic used here is to never process inodes
         * currently opened for write from background (i.e. non-sync) scans. For
         * sync scans, use the pagecache/dio state of the inode to ensure we
         * never free COW fork blocks out from under pending I/O.
         */
        if (!sync && inode_is_open_for_write(VFS_I(ip)))
                return false;
        if ((VFS_I(ip)->i_state & I_DIRTY_PAGES) ||
            mapping_tagged(VFS_I(ip)->i_mapping, PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY) ||
            mapping_tagged(VFS_I(ip)->i_mapping, PAGECACHE_TAG_WRITEBACK) ||
            atomic_read(&VFS_I(ip)->i_dio_count))
                return false;

... but again, not clear to me if upstream wants the patch or not. v2 or
shall I drop it?
