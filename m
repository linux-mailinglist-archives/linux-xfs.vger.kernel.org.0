So of course 5 minutes after sending this grouchy message I notice that
everthing you asked for can be done pretty easily by having each btree
type call a generic btree function that does:

int __init
xfs_btree_create_cursor_cache(xfs_btnum_t btnum, const char *name,
		unsigned int maxlevels)
{
	struct xfs_btree_cur_cache		*cc;

	cc = &xfs_btree_cur_caches[btnum];
	cc->name = name;
	cc->maxlevels = maxlevels;
	cc->alias = false;

	return 0;
}

and a similar destructor function to null all that out.

Then the xfs_db callout becomes:

unsigned int
xfs_btree_absolute_maxlevels(xfs_btnum_t btnum)
{
	return xfs_btree_cur_caches[btnum].maxlevels;
}

printf("rmap maxlevels %u\n",
		libxfs_btree_absolute_maxlevels(XFS_BTNUM_RMAP));

So yeah, I'll do that.
