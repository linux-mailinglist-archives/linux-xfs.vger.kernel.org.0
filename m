Right.

Write isolation is not that much of a constraint.  Qemu can set up the
sidecar internally and commit the sidecar back into the original image.
libvirt wraps this functionality.

Right.  The only modifications it does is to fsync the range, and that's
only an implementation detail of ocfs2 & xfs.

I think pnfs layouts and DAX writes also take IOLOCK_EXCL, right?  So
once reflink breaks the layouts, we're good there too?

I think that'll work.
