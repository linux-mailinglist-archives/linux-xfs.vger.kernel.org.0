Dear Sir,

I am Barr. Usman Bello an attorney to my late client Robert Norman the former managing director of Shell oil company Plc whom died after battling from COVID 19 and eventually died at the isolation center on the 26th/January/2021 which his daughter that was his next of kin also died on 22nd/February/2021 from the same COVID 19 virus disease.

In fact, why i contacted you is that want to front you as my client next of kin which it will be very easy for me to front you as his next of kin so that we can apply for this claim of his funds of $29.350m with his bank here in Nigeria hence his next of kin is no more existing.

So if you accept to make this deal with me in other to claim the stated funds then i shall change the next of kin documents to your name/favor then after the success of this deal you will take 35% and 5% shall be set aside for any expenses which might arise during this transaction and 60% will be my own share.

Waiting to receive your reply if you accept this deal and condition.
Barr. Usman Bello.
