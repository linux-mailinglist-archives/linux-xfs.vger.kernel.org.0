Yes, this is vital information to have in the commit message.

I'm guessing it has something to do with the fact that 'make dist' tries
to create source tarballs, which is a strange thing to do during the
binary build, and in any case it ultimately fails because tarball
generation now requires .gitcensus, which is cleaned out and then
requires git to regeneration, which you can't do when you're building
from a source tarball?

<shrug> Hm?
