I'm also a little confused about the use after free in the first place.
Doesn't xfs_bui_recover() look up the inode itself, or is the issue that
xfs_bui_recover() is fine but we might get into
xfs_bmap_update_finish_item() sometime later on the same inode without
any reference? If the latter, similarly to Christoph I wonder if we
really could/should grab a reference on the inode for the intent itself,
even though that might not be necessary outside of recovery.

Either way, more details about the problem being fixed in the commit log
would be helpful.
