The new log transaction to say "the new log is over there" so log
recovery knows that the old log is being replaced and can go find
the new log and recover it to free the old log.

IOWs, there's a heap of log recovery work needed, a new
intent/transaction type, futzing with feature bits because old
kernels won't be able to recovery such a operation, etc.

Then there's interesting issues that haven't ever been considered,
like having a discontiguity in the LSN as we physically switch logs.
What cycle number does the new log start at? What happens to all the
head and tail tracking fields when we switch to the new log? What
about all the log items in the AIL which is ordered by LSN? What
about all the active log items that track a specific LSN for
recovery integrity purposes (e.g. inode allocation buffers)? What
about updating the reservation grant heads that track log space
usage? Updating all the static size calculations used by the log
code which has to be done before the new log can be written to via
iclogs.

The allocation of the new log extent and the freeing of the old log
extent is the easy bit. Handling the failure cases to provide an
atomic, always recoverable switch and managing all the runtime state
and accounting changes that are necessary is the hard part...

Cheers,

Dave.
