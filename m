I agree with Brian, there ought to be some kind of warning that some
error happened with inode XXX even if we do end up shutting down
immediately afterwards.

I was wondering that too -- if filemap_flush, we'd stop immediately, but
now we keep going.  That certainly seems like a behavior change that
ought to be a separate patch from combining the two release functions?
