Yup, as documented in Documentation/filesystems/dax.txt. Specifically:

 6. When changing the S_DAX policy via toggling the persistent FS_XFLAG_DAX flag,
    the change in behaviour for existing regular files may not occur
    immediately.  If the change must take effect immediately, the administrator
    needs to:

    a) stop the application so there are no active references to the data set
       the policy change will affect

    b) evict the data set from kernel caches so it will be re-instantiated when
       the application is restarted. This can be achieved by:

       i. drop-caches
       ii. a filesystem unmount and mount cycle
       iii. a system reboot

Because of unfixable races in the page fault path that prevent
changing the caching behaviour of the inode while concurrent access
is possible. The only way to guarantee races can't happen is to
cycle the inode out of cache.

As per the documentation, that's exactly what the dax=always mount
option does.

Cheers,

Dave.
