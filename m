I think it's fair if something like XFS (not meant for tiny systems AFAIK?)
excludes SLOB (meant for tiny systems). Clearly nobody tried to use these
two together last 5 years anyway.
Maybe we could also just add the 4 bytes to all SLOB objects, declare
kfree() is always fine and be done with it. Yes, it will make SLOB footprint
somewhat less tiny, but even whan we added kmalloc power of two alignment
guarantees, the impact on SLOB was negligible.
