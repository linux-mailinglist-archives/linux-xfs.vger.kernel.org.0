Yeah, I think I misread this jumping between diffs, commits, the
historic tree, etc. got tangled up in the twisty, gnarly branches of
the code...

Yup, that seems reasonable to me - getting rid of all the
lazysbcount checks everywhere except the mount path would simplify
the code a lot...

Yeah, that's why I think we just turn it on unconditionally. It's
already deprecated, and all supported long term kernels support lazy
counters, so there's no reason for needing lazy-count=0 anymore...
