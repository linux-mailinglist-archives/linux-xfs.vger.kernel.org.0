Agreed, the callsites would be a bit more obvious if they looked like:

	error = xchk_should_terminate(sc);
	if (error)
		break;

Though I'm working on some tweaks of that function, since it was pointed
out to me that cond_resched() and fatal_signal_pending() aren't entirely
free.  What I've been testing out the last three weeks is:

	unsigned long now = jiffies;

	if (time_after(sc->next_poke, now)) {
		sc->next_poke = now + (HZ / 10);

		cond_resched();

		if (fatal_signal_pending(current))
			return -EINTR;
	}
	return 0;

So far I haven't seen much improvement, but the callsite change is
something that I think I could promote to the end of online repair
part 2.

Oops, lemme get rid of that dead code...
