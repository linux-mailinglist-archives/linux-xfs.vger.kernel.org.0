I've kinda avoided refactoring these early patches because they
cascade into non-trivial conflicts with later patches in the series.
I've spent too much time chasing bugs introduced in the later
patches because of conflict resolution not being quite right. Hence
I want to leave cleanup and refactoring to a series after this whole
line of development is complete and the problems are solved.

The inode iodone function changes almost immediately. I did it this
way so that the process of changing the inode buffer completion
functionality did not, in any way, impact on other types of buffers.
We need to go through the same process with dquot buffers, and then
once that is done, we can look to refactor all this into a more
integrated solution that largely sits in xfs_buf.c.

Cheers,

Dave.
