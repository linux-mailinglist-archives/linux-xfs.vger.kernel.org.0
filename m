Subject: [GIT PULL] xfs: new features for 5.2

Hi Linus,

Here's a big pile of new stuff for XFS for 5.2.  XFS has grown the
ability to report metadata health status to userspace after online fsck
checks the filesystem.  The online metadata checking code is (I really
hope) feature complete with the addition of checks for the global fs
counters, though it'll remain EXPERIMENTAL for now.

There are also fixes for thundering herds of writeback completions and
some other deadlocks, fixes for theoretical integer overflow attacks on
space accounting, and removal of the long-defunct 'mntpt' option which
was deprecated in the mid-2000s and (it turns out) totally broken since
2011 (and nobody complained...).

The branch merges cleanly against this morning's HEAD (as well as HEAD +
iomap-5.2-merge) and survived an overnight run of xfstests.  Let me know
if you run into anything weird along the way.  FYI, I will also be out
for about 10 days starting Thursday, so if anything urgent comes up
during that time, please don't hesitate to ask Dave or Eric.

  xfs: change some error-less functions to void types (2019-05-01 20:26:30 -0700)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for Linux 5.2:

- Fix some more buffer deadlocks when performing an unmount after a hard
  shutdown.
- Fix some minor space accounting issues.
- Fix some use after free problems.
- Make the (undocumented) FITRIM behavior consistent with other filesystems.
- Embiggen the xfs geometry ioctl's data structure.
- Introduce a new AG geometry ioctl.
- Introduce a new online health reporting infrastructure and ioctl for
  userspace to query a filesystem's health status.
- Enhance online scrub and repair to update the health reports.
- Reduce thundering herd problems when writeback io completes.
- Fix some transaction reservation type errors.
- Fix integer overflow problems with delayed alloc reservation counters.
- Fix some problems where we would exit to userspace without unlocking.
- Fix inconsistent behavior when finishing deferred ops fails.
- Strengthen scrub to check incore data against ondisk metadata.
- Remove long-broken mntpt mount option.
- Add an online scrub function for the filesystem summary counters,
  which should make online metadata scrub more or less feature complete
  for now.
- Various cleanups.
