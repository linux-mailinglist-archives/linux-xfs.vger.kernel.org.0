/me notes that a lot of the Oracle-copyright files are actually GPL-2+,
not GPL-2.  That might not be obvious because I bungled some of the SPDX
tags when spdx deprecated the "GPL-2.0+" tag and we had to replace them
all with "GPL-2.0-or-later", though it looks like they've all been
cleaned up at this point.

Question: How can we autogenerate debian/copyright from the source files
in the git repo?  In the long run I think it best that this becomes
something we can automate when tagging a new upstream release.
