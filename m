I admit I haven't actually looked at that.  A more precise way to handle
this would be for each intent recovery function to store its own worst
case resblks estimation in the recovery freezer so that we'd be using
roughly the same space requirements as the pre-crash transaction, but
that's also a lot more complicated than this kludge.

It tends to steer allocations towards whichever AGs were less full at
the start of each transaction.  Were we to shift to scanning the AGs
once for the entire recovery cycle, I think I'd probably pick a smaller
ratio.
