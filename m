Right - I've completely reimplemented the caching and LRUs so that
global bcache thingy goes away.

Which bits are they? THe bcache init stuff is gone, yes, but right

dev_ts to xfs_buftarg_alloc() for it to initialise similar to the
way the kernel initialises the buftarg.

I'm not afraid of them - I've got to at least get it to the compile
stage with all the infrastructure in place and that's been the hold
up. :P
