The space required in the iclog includes an extra ophdr, but *len
tracks the amount of region data we've copied. The continuation
ophdr space is not included in the region data, so that space does
not affect how we account for copied data.

However, we do need account for the space used by the continuation
ophdr in the space we use - reservation space, *log_offset and
*data_cnt - because those are used to track offset into the iclog,
data space used in the iclog and transaction reservation consumed.
The continuation header accounting is done separately ....

.... right here, immediately after we write it into the iclog data
buffer.
