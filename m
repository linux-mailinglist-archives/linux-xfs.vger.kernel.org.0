Yes, that is intended.

Right, we can add but we should never remove on-disk feature bits at
runtime. Getting rid of the noattr2 shenanigans dropped the only
case where we remove feature bits at runtime. Also, see below....

Nope, because a couple of patches further down the series,
mp->m_features will already contain all the mount features that have
been set and we do not want to overwrite them.
