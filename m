Fixed.

If the AIL is empty, then it's a no-op because pushing on the AIL is
not going to make more log space become free. Besides, that's not
the problem being solved here - reservation wakeups on first insert
into the AIL are already handled by xfs_trans_ail_update_bulk() and
hence the first patch in the series. This patch is addressing the
situation where the bulk insert that occurs from the callbacks that
are about to run -does not modify the tail of the log-. i.e. the
commit moved the head but not the tail, so we have to update the AIL
push target to take into account the new log head....

i.e. the AIL is for moving the tail of the log - this code moves the
head of the log. But both impact on the AIL push target (it is based on
the distance between the head and tail), so we need
to update the push target just in case this commit does not move
the tail...

Two things that I see straight away:

1. if the AIL is empty, the first insert does not set mlip_changed =
true and and so there will be no wakeup in the scenario you are
posing. This would be easy to fix - if (!mlip || changed) - so that
a wakeup is triggered in this case.

2. if we have not moved the tail, then calling xfs_log_space_wake()
will, at best, just burn CPU. At worst, it wll cause hundreds of
thousands of spurious wakeups a seconds because the waiting
transaction reservation will be woken continuously when there isn't
space available and there hasn't been any space made available.

So, from #1 we see that unconditional wakeups are not necessary in
the scenario you pose, and from #2 it's not a viable solution even
if it was required.

However, #1 indicates other problems if a xfs_log_space_wake() call
is necessary in this case. No reservations space and an empty AIL
implies that the CIL pins the entire log - a pending commit that
hasn't finished flushing and the current context that is
aggregating. This implies we've violated a much more important rule
of the on-disk log format: finding the head and tail of the log
requires no individual commit be larger than 50% of the log.

So if we are actually stalling on trasnaction reservations with an
empty AIL and an uncommitted CIL, screwing around with tail pushing
wakeups does not address the bigger problem being seen...

Cheers,

Dave.
