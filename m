Yeah, it's intended to return a sorting key, not do a sort. Naming
is hard, and this is an RFC so it's expected that the naming will
weird and need improvement. :)

As it is, I suspect that a generic filesystem object wide sorting
mechanism needs to be more complex than just returning a single 64
bit key. I think it will work generically if the key reference frame
is the same for all object - I kinda just chose the object's location
on disk for the reference frame and hence the use of the inode
number as the sort key value here.

However, I'm not 100% sure how that would end up working if we have
the object we are trying to sort doesn't have a defined physical
location.  That doesn't seem to be an issue right now - all of the
objects I want to sort have phsyical locations - so I've largely
ignored it this side of the problem. If we need to, we can change
how the sorting works when sorting by physical location is no longer
sufficient as this is purely an in-memory ordering issue...

Cheers,

Dave.
