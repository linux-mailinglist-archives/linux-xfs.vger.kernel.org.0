Yes. XFS stats are low overhead unsynchronised per-cpu counters,
never guaranteed to be perfectly accurate or consistent because,
well, unsycnhronised per-cpu counters are neither.

IOWs, individual counters are never "point in time" accurate because of
counter update races during aggregation. Multiple counters are never
"point in time" synchronised, either, as individual
counters are aggregated sequentially and hence have different,
unsynchronised sampling times.

IOWs, the stats are not really meaningful as aboslute values - they
are generally used for monitoring purposes via delta sampling (e.g.
"how many of these events happened in the last second") or checking
that certain operations have occurred as a basic code coverage check
for developers (e.g. did we split the freespace inode btree at all
during a fstests run?).....

Cheers,

Dave.
