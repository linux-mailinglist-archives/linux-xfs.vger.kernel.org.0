Note that you're reporting problems with a distro kernel and proprietary
hypervisor to an upstream mailing list (via an upstream bug tracker).
The feedback will likely be limited unless you can reproduce on an
upstream kernel.

In general, it's not really clear to me what you're reporting beyond the
writeback task using more CPU than anticipated. What is that based on?
What problematic functional or performance related behavior is observed?
If performance related, what exactly is the workload?

I think we've had some upstream patches to fix underflows and such in
space reporting paths fairly recently, but I'm not sure off hand if
those are associated with any functional issues beyond indication of
potential corruption. This suggests you should probably run 'xfs_repair
-n' on this filesystem if you haven't already.
