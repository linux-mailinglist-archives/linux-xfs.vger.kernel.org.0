I have been expecting to hear from you as regards to my previous message in view of Martin's Estate and inheritance claims, I had a problem with my email so I am not sure if you got it. Please respond to my message so I can give you further details on how to apply to the bank, this is very important.

Regards,
Ryan Jules.
