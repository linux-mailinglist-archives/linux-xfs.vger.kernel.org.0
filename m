The page-based caching still has to be supported anyway, since that's what the
other filesystems that support fsverity use, and it seems you don't plan to
change that.  The question is where the "block verified" flags should be stored.
Currently there are two options: PG_checked and the separate bitmap.  I'm not
yet convinced that removing the support for the PG_checked method is a good
change.  PG_checked is a nice solution for the cases where it can be used; it
requires no extra memory, no locking, and has no max file size.  Also, this
change seems mostly orthogonal to what you're actually trying to accomplish.

When part of the Merkle tree cache is evicted and re-instantiated, whether that
part is a "page" or something else, the verified status of all the blocks
contained in that part need to be invalidated so that they get re-verified.  The
existing code does that.  I don't see how your proposed code does that.
