Add some words, there might raise up some additional assistance
transactions (e.g. if we'd like to confirm bmbt has the only one extent
rather than just do some basic math to confirm the whole AG is empty)
we might need to put all AGFL free blocks from AGFL to bmbt as well. Yet
that process is independent from the main shrinking transaction. And
in principle have no visible impact to users.

I'll reply the rest suggestions tomorrow, thanks for the review again!

Thanks,
