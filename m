Yeah, you're probably right. I just wanted to give people some options
if they do not want (for whatever reason) to use systemd. Container
environment might be a good example of that, but I am not at all sure
how well is lvm2 supported in containers.

Ok, thanks for suggestion. Andreas was suggesting naming it as part of
e2fsprogs, that is - e2fsprogs-scrub but then it would be
e2fsprogs-scrub-systemd and that sounds a bit convoluted to me.

Thanks!
