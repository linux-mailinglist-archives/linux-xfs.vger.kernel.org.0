I cannot say too much of this, yet my current observation is that
shrinking tail empty AG [+ empty AGs (optional)] in one transaction
is practical (I don't see any barrier so far [1]). I'm implementing
an atomic all-or-nothing truncation and userspace can utilize it to
implement in all-or-nothing way (I saw Dave's spaceman work before) or
incremental way (by using binary search approach and multiple ioctls)...
In principle, supporting the ioctl with the extra partial shrinking
feature is practial as well (but additional work might need to be
done). And also, I'm not sure it's user-friendly since most end-users
might want an all-or-nothing shrinking (at least in the fs truncation
step) result.

btw, afaik (my limited understanding), Ext4 shrinking is an offline
approach so it's somewhat easier to implement (no need to consider
any runtime impact), which is also considered as an all-or-nothing
truncation as well (Although it also supports -M to shrink the
filesystem to the minimum size, I think it can be implemented by
multiple all-or-nothing shrink ioctls...)

Thanks,
Gao Xiang

[1] it's somewhat outdated yet I'd like to finish this tail AG patchset
first
