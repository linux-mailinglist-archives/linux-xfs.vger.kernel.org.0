Once the log has shut down, is there any reason we shouldn't consider
the filesystem shut down too?

IOWs, should xfs_is_shutdown be doing something like this:

bool
xfs_is_shutdown(struct xfs_mount *mp)
{
	return test_bit(XFS_OPSTATE_SHUTDOWN, &mp->m_opstate) ||
		xlog_is_shutdown(mp->m_log);
}

I could very easily envision myself reintroducing bugs w.r.t.
{xfs,xlog}_is_shutdown because it's not immediately obvious to me
(particularly in xfs_buf.c) which one I ought to use.

Another way to put this is: what needs to succeed between the point
where we set OPSTATE_SHUTDOWN and XLOG_IO_ERROR?  Is the answer to that
"any log IO that was initiated right up until we actually set
XLOG_IO_ERROR"?  Which means random parts of the buffer cache, and the
inode/dquot flush code?

IOWs the log flush and any AIL writeback that was in progress?

Does inode flush failure leading to immediate shutdown need to happen
with the dquot code too?  I /think/ we don't?  Because all we do is
