Interesting.  Off the top of my head, I assume that xfs is not looking at
current file space usage when deciding how much is needed to satisfy the
fallocate request.  While filesystems can return ENOSPC at any time for
any reason, this does seem a bit suboptimal.

Presumably you've tried stracing it and looking for ENOSPC returns from
syscalls?
