Insofar as this has revealed a whole ton of *more* problems in mkfs,
Reviewed-by: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

Specifically: if I set su=128k,sw=4, some tests will try to format a
512M filesystem.  This results in an 8-AG filesystem with a log that
fills up almost but not all of an entire AG.  The AG then ends up with
an empty bnobt and an empty AGFL, and 25 missing blocks...

...oh and the new test vms that run this config failed to finish for
some reason.  Sigh.
