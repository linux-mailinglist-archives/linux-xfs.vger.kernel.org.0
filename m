Ok, that works for me, but the extra close changes golder output
for overlayfs:

$ xfs_io -f x -c "open y" -c close
[000] x              (foreign,non-sync,non-direct,read-write)

So either we add more logic to filter that out or we just leave out the close
making the test in overlayfs depends on the fsync-all behavior of xfs_io
and leaving the test logic on xfs unchanged per your proposal.

If you are ok with that, I will test the version that you proposed and re-post.

Thanks,
Amir.
