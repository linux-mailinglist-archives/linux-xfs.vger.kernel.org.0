In theory, yes. But by now we're aware of the current convention of
assuming plain aligned writes up to word-size are atomic (which KCSAN
respects with default Kconfig).

Right. In reality, for mainstream architectures, it appears quite unlikely.

There may be other valid reasons, such as documenting the fact the
write can happen concurrently with loads.

Let's assume the WRITE_ONCE can be dropped.

The load is a different story. While load tearing may not be an issue,
it's more likely that other optimizations can break the code. For
example load fusing can break code that expects repeated loads in a
loop. E.g. I found these uses of i_size_read in loops:

git grep -E '(for|while) \(.*i_size_read'
fs/ocfs2/dir.c: while (ctx->pos < i_size_read(inode)) {
fs/ocfs2/dir.c:                 for (i = 0; i < i_size_read(inode) &&
i < offset; ) {
fs/ocfs2/dir.c: while (ctx->pos < i_size_read(inode)) {
fs/ocfs2/dir.c:         while (ctx->pos < i_size_read(inode)
fs/squashfs/dir.c:      while (length < i_size_read(inode)) {
fs/squashfs/namei.c:    while (length < i_size_read(dir)) {

Can i_size writes happen concurrently, and if so will these break if
the compiler decides to just do i_size_read's load once, and keep the
result in a register?

Thanks,
