Distros should be shipping that library, and configure asks you to
install it if it isn't present, just like it does for all the other
libraries xfsprogs depends on. We want users to install distro
libraries, not have to build dependencies from source and install
them...

Yeah, we need a lot more than just e2fsprogs-devel and UUIDs these
days. I'd prefer that doc/INSTALL just says "the configure script
will prompt you to install missing build dependencies" rather than
iterate them here and have the list be perpetually incomplete....

Cheers,

Dave.
