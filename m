Is there an intention to allow enabling parent pointers on existing systems
and run online repair to add the pptr xattrs?

If not, then you could avoid the entire complexity with
statp->f_namelen = XFS_MAX_PPTR_NAMELEN;
for pptr formatted fs.

Are those 12 bytes of namelen really going to be missed?
This limitation does not need to last forever.
It can be lifted later by special casing pptr namelen as you suggested
after a separate risk vs. benefit discussion.

Thanks,
Amir.
