Yup, I can see how that would happen, but patching the directory
code still smells like band-aid to me on multiple levels.

At first glance, this seems like the first step in a on-going game
of whack-a-mole. If shrink is changing how the on disk format needs
to be evaluated in ways that older kernels can't safely deal with,
then shrink needs to be setting an incompat feature bit to prevent
older kernels from crashing trying to parse the on-disk format.

On deeper consideration after looking at the code, why is it even
considered safe to be recovering pre- and post- shrink operations in
a single log recovery operation? i.e. I see nothing in the shrink
code that quiesces the log and flushes all the dirty metadata to
stable storage prior to logging the superblock geometry changes and
returning to userspace.

I can think of another situation where this might be problematic -
recovering buffers containing unlinked inode lists updates. If the
inode cluster buffers we recover from transactions before the shrink
point to inodes that are beyond EOFS after the shrink, we recover
them and write them to disk, only for them to be read again and
written to disk when recovering subsequent transactions prior
to shrink.

IOWs, we can have transient on-disk state during log recovery where
stuff before the shrink transaction points to objects beyond the
EOFS after the shrink, but are still considered to be valid by log
recovery. If the device has already been shrunk, then log recovery
has just created a transient corrupt on-disk state, so if log
recovery fails at this point (for whatever reason), we've got a mess
on our hands.

I suspect that this means we could also have problems in the AIL,
too, but I haven't thought that far through this right now. The
transient corrupt log recovery state can be fixed by forcing the AIL
to be written back before we execute the shrink transaction so the
shrink transaction ends up being written to the tail of the log.
Doing this would also fix any sort of transient AIL ordering issue
that might exist around a shrink operation....

So, yeah, I think this problem hints at bigger issues with shrink,
on disk format interpretation and transient log recovery states. I
think we need to finish off all the infrastructure shrink needs
before we go any further with it....

Cheers,

Dave.
