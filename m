Hi all!

During LSFMM 2022, I have had an opportunity to speak with developers
from several different companies that showed interest in collaborating
on the effort of improving the state of xfs code in LTS kernels.

I would like to kick-off this effort for the 5.10 LTS kernel, in the
hope that others will join me in the future to produce a better common
baseline for everyone to build on.

This is the first of 6 series of stable patch candidates that
I collected from xfs releases v5.11..v5.18 [1].

My intention is to post the parts for review on the xfs list on
a ~weekly basis and forward them to stable only after xfs developers
have had the chance to review the selection.

I used a gadget that I developed "b4 rn" that produces high level
"release notes" with references to the posted patch series and also
looks for mentions of fstest names in the discussions on lore.
I then used an elimination process to select the stable tree candidate
patches. The selection process is documented in the git log of [1].

After I had candidates, Luis has helped me to set up a kdevops testing
environment on a server that Samsung has contributed to the effort.
Luis and I have spent a considerable amount of time to establish the
expunge lists that produce stable baseline results for v5.10.y [2].
Eventually, we ran the auto group test over 100 times to sanitize the
baseline, on the following configurations:
reflink_normapbt (default), reflink, reflink_1024, nocrc, nocrc_512.

The patches in this part are from circa v5.11 release.
They have been through 36 auto group runs with the configs listed above
and no regressions from baseline were observed.

At least two of the fixes have regression tests in fstests that were used
to verify the fix. I also annotated [3] the fix commits in the tests.

I would like to thank Luis for his huge part in this still ongoing effort
and I would like to thank Samsung for contributing the hardware resources
to drive this effort.

Your inputs on the selection in this part and in upcoming parts [1]
are most welcome!

Thanks,
Amir.
