Yeah, and it's not quite as simple as just using PF_MEMALLOC_NOFS
at high levels - we'll still need to annotate callers that use KM_NOFS
to avoid lockdep false positives. i.e. any code that can be called from
GFP_KERNEL and reclaim context will throw false positives from
lockdep if we don't annotate tehm correctly....

Already changed it to uintptr_t when I did...

.... this. Well, not exactly this - I pass in the alignment required
as an int, and the callers get it from the request queue....

Yup, just smoke testing it now before I resend.

Cheers,
