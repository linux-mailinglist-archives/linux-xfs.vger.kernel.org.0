Ah, so it's recovery that trips this....

Yeah, OK, I think this is because we are combining attribute
creation with inode creation. When log recovery replays inode core
modifications, it replays the inode state into the cluster buffer
and writes it. Then when we go to replay the attr intent at the end
of recovery, the inode is read from disk via xlog_recover_iget(),
but we don't initialise the attr fork because ip->i_forkoff is zero.
i.e. it has no attrs at this point.

I suspect that we could catch that in xlog_recover_iget() when it is
called from attr recovery. i.e. we detect newly created inodes and
initialise the attr fork similar to what we do in
xfs_init_new_inode(). I was thinking something like this:

	if (init_xattrs && xfs_has_attr(mp)) {
		if (!ip->i_forkoff && !ip->i_nextents) {
			ip->i_forkoff = xfs_default_attroffset(ip) >> 3;
			ip->i_afp = xfs_ifork_alloc(XFS_DINODE_FMT_EXTENTS, 0);
		} else {
			ASSERT(ip->i_afp);
		}
	}

Would do the trick, but then I realised that the timing/ordering is
very different to runtime: we don't replay the attr intent until the
end of log recovery and all the inode changes have been replayed
into the inode cluster buffer. That means we could have already
replayed a bunch of data fork extent modifications into the inode,
and so the default attr offset is almost certainly not a safe thing
to be using here. Indeed, there might not be space in the inode for
the attr we want to insert and so we might need to convert the data
fork to a different format before we run the attr intent replay.

That does indeed take us down the path of needing to run a full attr
fork creation operation, because we aren't creating the parent attr
when the data fork is empty in recovery. i.e. recovery is changing
the temporal order of data fork vs attr operations because intent
recovery uses an eventual consistency model rather than the
immediate consistency model that runtime uses.

Hmmmm. I'm going to have to have a think about the implications of
that relevation. I think it does mean we need recovery to be able to
run an attr fork initialisation, but I suspect it also means that
the runtime fork initialisation might also need to include it, too.

I'll need to think on this a bit.

Yup, it most definitely helped. :)

You've pointed out something I had completely missed w.r.t. attr
intent replay ordering against replay of data fork modifications.
There's definitely an issue here, I think it might be a fundamental
issue with the recovery mechanism (and not parent pointers), and I
think we'll end up needing  something like this patch to fix it.
Let me bounce this around my head for a bit...

Cheers,

Dave.
