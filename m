I think you are right here:

     crash> p $s->name
     $84 = 0xffffffff82259401 "bio_integrity_payload"
     crash> p $s->refcount
     $88 = 8
     crash> p $s
     $92 = (struct kmem_cache *) 0xffff88bff92d2bc0
     crash> p sizeof(xfs_inode_log_item_t)
     $93 = 192
     crash> p $s->object_size
     $94 = 192

So if I understand you correctly, this is expected behavior with this kind of load and conceptual changes are already scheduled for kernel 5.9. I don't understand most of it, but isn't it true that with that planned changes the impact might be better limited to the filesystem, so that the performance of other areas of the system might improve? I'd love to test that with our load, but I don't want to risk our backup data and it would be difficult to produce the same load on a toy system. The patch set is not yet ready to be tested on production data, is it?

So I guess I'll try to put the backup processes into one or more cgroups to limit the memory available for their fs caches and leave some room for unrelated (maintenance) processes. I hope, that makes sense.

Thank you both four your analysis!
