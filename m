I'm not really sure how you're inferring what cases free the buffer vs.
what don't based on ->b_lru_ref. A buffer is freed when its reference
count (->b_hold) drops to zero unless ->b_lru_ref is non-zero, at which
point the buffer goes on the LRU and the LRU itself takes a ->b_hold
reference to keep the buffer from being freed. This reference is not
associated with how many cycles through the LRU a buffer is allowed
before it is dropped from the LRU, which is what ->b_lru_ref tracks.

Since the LRU holds a (single) reference to the buffer just like any
other user of the buffer, it doesn't make any direct decision on when to
free a buffer or not. In other words, the bug fixed by this patch is
related to when we decide to drop the buffer from the LRU based on the
LRU ref count. If the LRU ->b_hold reference happens to be the last on
the buffer when it is dropped from the LRU, then the buffer is freed.

Seems reasonable to me. Feel free to post a patch. :)
