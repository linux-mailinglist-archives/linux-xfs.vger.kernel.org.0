Hi all,

This patchset fills some gaps in our fuzz testing for XFS.  I forgot to
include fuzz testing the data fork mappings of directories and xattrs to
see how scrub responds to nonsensical file maps, and I omitted tests to
fuzz the realtime metadata.  Add those.

Finally, add a new fuzz testing strategy known as bothrepair.  This
simulates what system administrators are most likely to do upon
receiving a health alert about a pet filesystem -- try to repair it with
xfs_scrub, and if that doesn't work, unmount the filesystem and run
xfs_repair.  Between the two, we ought to be able to fix every possible
problem.

If you're going to start using this mess, you probably ought to just
pull from my git trees, which are linked below.

This is an extraordinary way to destroy everything.  Enjoy!
Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
