I think this is incorrect. The original C standard defines enums as
signed integers, not unsigned. And according to the GCC manual
(section 4.9 Structures, Unions, Enumerations, and Bit-Fields)
indicates that C90 first defines the enum type to be compatible with
the declared values. IOWs, for a build using C89 like the kernel
does, enums should always be signed.

This enum is defined as:

enum xfs_icwalk_goal {
        /* Goals that are not related to tags; these must be < 0. */
        XFS_ICWALK_DQRELE       = -1,

        /* Goals directly associated with tagged inodes. */
        XFS_ICWALK_BLOCKGC      = XFS_ICI_BLOCKGC_TAG,
        XFS_ICWALK_RECLAIM      = XFS_ICI_RECLAIM_TAG,
};

i.e. the enum is defined to clearly contain negative values and so
GCC should be defining it as a signed integer regardless of the
version of C being used...

Yup, smatch has definitely got that one wrong:

xfs_dqrele_all_inodes()
  xfs_icwalk(mp, XFS_ICWALK_DQRELE, &icw);
    xfs_icwalk_get_perag(.... XFS_ICWALK_DQRELE)
      xfs_icwalk_tag(... XFS_ICWALK_DQRELE, ...)

So this warning looks like an issue with smatch, not a bug in the
code...

Cheers,

Dave.
