Source kernel commit: 1ddd6c9a04ae0fed6790e1ba8294b0a2e6ed8066

TLDR: Revert commit 51e6104fdb95 ("xfs: detect empty attr leaf blocks in
xfs_attr3_leaf_verify") because it was wrong.

Every now and then we get a corruption report from the kernel or
xfs_repair about empty leaf blocks in the extended attribute structure.
We've long thought that these shouldn't be possible, but prior to 5.18
one would shake loose in the recoveryloop fstests about once a month.

A new addition to the xattr leaf block verifier in 5.19-rc1 makes this
happen every 7 minutes on my testing cloud.  I added a ton of logging to
detect any time we set the header count on an xattr leaf block to zero.
This produced the following dmesg output on generic/388:

XFS (sda4): ino 0x21fcbaf leaf 0x129bf78 hdcount==0!
Call Trace:

So now we know that someone is creating empty xattr leaf blocks as part
of converting a sf xattr structure into a leaf xattr structure.  The
conversion routine logs any existing sf attributes in the same
transaction that creates the leaf block, so we know this is a setxattr
to a file that has no attributes at all.

Next, g/388 calls the shutdown ioctl and cycles the mount to trigger log
recovery.  I also augmented buffer item recovery to call ->verify_struct
on any attr leaf blocks and complain if it finds a failure:

XFS (sda4): Unmounting Filesystem
XFS (sda4): Mounting V5 Filesystem
XFS (sda4): Starting recovery (logdev: internal)

And a moment later, the _delwri_submit of the recovered buffers trips
the same verifier and recovery fails:

I think I see what's going on here -- setxattr is racing with something
that shuts down the filesystem:

Thread 1                                Thread 2

xfs_buf_delwri_submit
_xfs_buf_ioapply(leaf)
xfs_attr3_leaf_write_verify
<trip over empty leaf buffer>
<fail recovery>

As you can see, the bhold keeps the leaf buffer locked and thus prevents
the *AIL* from tripping over the ichdr.count==0 check in the write
verifier.  Unfortunately, it doesn't prevent the log from getting
flushed to disk, which sets up log recovery to fail.

So.  It's clear that the kernel has always had the ability to persist
attr leaf blocks with ichdr.count==0, which means that it's part of the
ondisk format now.

Unfortunately, this check has been added and removed multiple times
throughout history.  It first appeared in[1] kernel 3.10 as part of the
early V5 format patches.  The check was later discovered to break log
recovery and hence disabled[2] during log recovery in kernel 4.10.
Simultaneously, the check was added[3] to xfs_repair 4.9.0 to try to
weed out the empty leaf blocks.  This was still not correct because log
recovery would recover an empty attr leaf block successfully only for
regular xattr operations to trip over the empty block during of the
block during regular operation.  Therefore, the check was removed
entirely[4] in kernel 5.7 but removal of the xfs_repair check was
forgotten.  The continued complaints from xfs_repair lead to us
mistakenly re-adding[5] the verifier check for kernel 5.19.  Remove it
once again.

[1] 517c22207b04 ("xfs: add CRCs to attr leaf blocks")
[2] 2e1d23370e75 ("xfs: ignore leaf attr ichdr.count in verifier
during log replay")
[3] f7140161 ("xfs_repair: junk leaf attribute if count == 0")
[4] f28cef9e4dac ("xfs: don't fail verifier on empty attr3 leaf
block")
[5] 51e6104fdb95 ("xfs: detect empty attr leaf blocks in
xfs_attr3_leaf_verify")

Looking at the rest of the xattr code, it seems that files with empty
leaf blocks behave as expected -- listxattr reports no attributes;
getxattr on any xattr returns nothing as expected; removexattr does
nothing; and setxattr can add attributes just fine.
