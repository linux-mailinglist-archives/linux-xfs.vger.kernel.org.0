-Introduction to Re-logging in XFS
-=================================
-
-XFS logging is a combination of logical and physical logging. Some objects,
-such as inodes and dquots, are logged in logical format where the details
-logged are made up of the changes to in-core structures rather than on-disk
-structures. Other objects - typically buffers - have their physical changes
-logged. The reason for these differences is to reduce the amount of log space
-required for objects that are frequently logged. Some parts of inodes are more
-frequently logged than others, and inodes are typically more frequently logged
-than any other object (except maybe the superblock buffer) so keeping the
-amount of metadata logged low is of prime importance.
-
-The reason that this is such a concern is that XFS allows multiple separate
-modifications to a single object to be carried in the log at any given time.
-This allows the log to avoid needing to flush each change to disk before
-recording a new change to the object. XFS does this via a method called
-"re-logging". Conceptually, this is quite simple - all it requires is that any
-new change to the object is recorded with a *new copy* of all the existing
-changes in the new transaction that is written to the log.
+==================
+XFS Logging Design
+==================
+
+Preamble
+========
+
+This document describes the design and algorithms that the XFS journalling
+subsystem is based on. This document describes the design and algorithms that
+the XFS journalling subsystem is based on so that readers may familiarize
+themselves with the general concepts of how transaction processing in XFS works.
+
+We begin with an overview of transactions in XFS, followed by describing how
+transaction reservations are structured and accounted, and then move into how we
+guarantee forwards progress for long running transactions with finite initial
+reservations bounds. At this point we need to explain how relogging works. With
+the basic concepts covered, the design of the delayed logging mechanism is
+documented.
+
+
+Introduction
+============
+
+XFS uses Write Ahead Logging for ensuring changes to the filesystem metadata
+are atomic and recoverable. For reasons of space and time efficiency, the
+logging mechanisms are varied and complex, combining intents, logical and
+physical logging mechanisms to provide the necessary recovery guarantees the
+filesystem requires.
+
+Some objects, such as inodes and dquots, are logged in logical format where the
+details logged are made up of the changes to in-core structures rather than
+on-disk structures. Other objects - typically buffers - have their physical
+changes logged. Long running atomic modifications have individual changes
+chained together by intents, ensuring that journal recovery can restart and
+finish an operation that was only partially done when the system stopped
+functioning.
+
+The reason for these differences is to keep the amount of log space and CPU time
+required to process objects being modified as small as possible and hence the
+logging overhead as low as possible. Some items are very frequently modified,
+and some parts of objects are more frequently modified than others, so keeping
+the overhead of metadata logging low is of prime importance.
+
+The method used to log an item or chain modifications together isn't
+particularly important in the scope of this document. It suffices to know that
+the method used for logging a particular object or chaining modifications
+together are different and are dependent on the object and/or modification being
+performed. The logging subsystem only cares that certain specific rules are
+followed to guarantee forwards progress and prevent deadlocks.
+
+
+Transactions in XFS
+===================
+
+XFS has two types of high level transactions, defined by the type of log space
+reservation they take. These are known as "one shot" and "permanent"
+transactions. Permanent transaction reservations can take reservations that span
+commit boundaries, whilst "one shot" transactions are for a single atomic
+modification.
+
+The type and size of reservation must be matched to the modification taking
+place.  This means that permanent transactions can be used for one-shot
+modifications, but one-shot reservations cannot be used for permanent
+transactions.
+
+In the code, a one-shot transaction pattern looks somewhat like this::
+
+	tp = xfs_trans_alloc(<reservation>)
+	<lock items>
+	<join item to transaction>
+	<do modification>
+	xfs_trans_commit(tp);
+
+As items are modified in the transaction, the dirty regions in those items are
+tracked via the transaction handle.  Once the transaction is committed, all
+resources joined to it are released, along with the remaining unused reservation
+space that was taken at the transaction allocation time.
+
+In contrast, a permanent transaction is made up of multiple linked individual
+transactions, and the pattern looks like this::
+
+	tp = xfs_trans_alloc(<reservation>)
+	xfs_ilock(ip, XFS_ILOCK_EXCL)
+
+	loop {
+		xfs_trans_ijoin(tp, 0);
+		<do modification>
+		xfs_trans_log_inode(tp, ip);
+		xfs_trans_roll(&tp);
+	}
+
+	xfs_trans_commit(tp);
+	xfs_iunlock(ip, XFS_ILOCK_EXCL);
+
+While this might look similar to a one-shot transaction, there is an important
+difference: xfs_trans_roll() performs a specific operation that links two
+transactions together::
+
+	ntp = xfs_trans_dup(tp);
+	xfs_trans_commit(tp);
+	xfs_log_reserve(ntp);
+
+This results in a series of "rolling transactions" where the inode is locked
+across the entire chain of transactions.  Hence while this series of rolling
+transactions is running, nothing else can read from or write to the inode and
+this provides a mechanism for complex changes to appear atomic from an external
+observer's point of view.
+
+It is important to note that a series of rolling transactions in a permanent
+transaction does not form an atomic change in the journal. While each
+individual modification is atomic, the chain is *not atomic*. If we crash half
+way through, then recovery will only replay up to the last transactional
+modification the loop made that was committed to the journal.
+
+This affects long running permanent transactions in that it is not possible to
+predict how much of a long running operation will actually be recovered because
+there is no guarantee of how much of the operation reached stale storage. Hence
+if a long running operation requires multiple transactions to fully complete,
+the high level operation must use intents and deferred operations to guarantee
+recovery can complete the operation once the first transactions is persisted in
+the on-disk journal.
+
+
+Transactions are Asynchronous
+=============================
+
+In XFS, all high level transactions are asynchronous by default. This means that
+xfs_trans_commit() does not guarantee that the modification has been committed
+to stable storage when it returns. Hence when a system crashes, not all the
+completed transactions will be replayed during recovery.
+
+However, the logging subsystem does provide global ordering guarantees, such
+that if a specific change is seen after recovery, all metadata modifications
+that were committed prior to that change will also be seen.
+
+For single shot operations that need to reach stable storage immediately, or
+ensuring that a long running permanent transaction is fully committed once it is
+complete, we can explicitly tag a transaction as synchronous. This will trigger
+a "log force" to flush the outstanding committed transactions to stable storage
+in the journal and wait for that to complete.
+
+Synchronous transactions are rarely used, however, because they limit logging
+throughput to the IO latency limitations of the underlying storage. Instead, we
+tend to use log forces to ensure modifications are on stable storage only when
+a user operation requires a synchronisation point to occur (e.g. fsync).
+
+
+Transaction Reservations
+========================
+
+It has been mentioned a number of times now that the logging subsystem needs to
+provide a forwards progress guarantee so that no modification ever stalls
+because it can't be written to the journal due to a lack of space in the
+journal. This is achieved by the transaction reservations that are made when
+a transaction is first allocated. For permanent transactions, these reservations
+are maintained as part of the transaction rolling mechanism.
+
+A transaction reservation provides a guarantee that there is physical log space
+available to write the modification into the journal before we start making
+modifications to objects and items. As such, the reservation needs to be large
+enough to take into account the amount of metadata that the change might need to
+log in the worst case. This means that if we are modifying a btree in the
+transaction, we have to reserve enough space to record a full leaf-to-root split
+of the btree. As such, the reservations are quite complex because we have to
+take into account all the hidden changes that might occur.
+
+For example, a user data extent allocation involves allocating an extent from
+free space, which modifies the free space trees. That's two btrees.  Inserting
+the extent into the inode's extent map might require a split of the extent map
+btree, which requires another allocation that can modify the free space trees
+again.  Then we might have to update reverse mappings, which modifies yet
+another btree which might require more space. And so on.  Hence the amount of
+metadata that a "simple" operation can modify can be quite large.
+
+This "worst case" calculation provides us with the static "unit reservation"
+for the transaction that is calculated at mount time. We must guarantee that the
+log has this much space available before the transaction is allowed to proceed
+so that when we come to write the dirty metadata into the log we don't run out
+of log space half way through the write.
+
+For one-shot transactions, a single unit space reservation is all that is
+required for the transaction to proceed. For permanent transactions, however, we
+also have a "log count" that affects the size of the reservation that is to be
+made.
+
+While a permanent transaction can get by with a single unit of space
+reservation, it is somewhat inefficient to do this as it requires the
+transaction rolling mechanism to re-reserve space on every transaction roll. We
+know from the implementation of the permanent transactions how many transaction
+rolls are likely for the common modifications that need to be made.
+
+For example, and inode allocation is typically two transactions - one to
+physically allocate a free inode chunk on disk, and another to allocate an inode
+from an inode chunk that has free inodes in it.  Hence for an inode allocation
+transaction, we might set the reservation log count to a value of 2 to indicate
+that the common/fast path transaction will commit two linked transactions in a
+chain. Each time a permanent transaction rolls, it consumes an entire unit
+reservation.
+
+Hence when the permanent transaction is first allocated, the log space
+reservation is increases from a single unit reservation to multiple unit
+reservations. That multiple is defined by the reservation log count, and this
+means we can roll the transaction multiple times before we have to re-reserve
+log space when we roll the transaction. This ensures that the common
+modifications we make only need to reserve log space once.
+
+If the log count for a permanent transaction reaches zero, then it needs to
+re-reserve physical space in the log. This is somewhat complex, and requires
+an understanding of how the log accounts for space that has been reserved.
+
+
+Log Space Accounting
+====================
+
+The position in the log is typically referred to as a Log Sequence Number (LSN).
+The log is circular, so the positions in the log are defined by the combination
+of a cycle number - the number of times the log has been overwritten - and the
+offset into the log.  A LSN carries the cycle in the upper 32 bits and the
+offset in the lower 32 bits. The offset is in units of "basic blocks" (512
+bytes). Hence we can do realtively simple LSN based math to keep track of
+available space in the log.
+
+Log space accounting is done via a pair of constructs called "grant heads".  The
+position of the grant heads is an absolute value, so the amount of space
+available in the log is defined by the distance between the position of the
+grant head and the current log tail. That is, how much space can be
+reserved/consumed before the grant heads would fully wrap the log and overtake
+the tail position.
+
+The first grant head is the "reserve" head. This tracks the byte count of the
+reservations currently held by active transactions. It is a purely in-memory
+accounting of the space reservation and, as such, actually tracks byte offsets
+into the log rather than basic blocks. Hence it technically isn't using LSNs to
+represent the log position, but it is still treated like a split {cycle,offset}
+tuple for the purposes of tracking reservation space.
+
+The reserve grant head is used to accurately account for exact transaction
+reservations amounts and the exact byte count that modifications actually make
+and need to write into the log. The reserve head is used to prevent new
+transactions from taking new reservations when the head reaches the current
+tail. It will block new reservations in a FIFO queue and as the log tail moves
+forward it will wake them in order once sufficient space is available. This FIFO
+mechanism ensures no transaction is starved of resources when log space
+shortages occur.
+
+The other grant head is the "write" head. Unlike the reserve head, this grant
+head contains an LSN and it tracks the physical space usage in the log. While
+this might sound like it is accounting the same state as the reserve grant head
+- and it mostly does track exactly the same location as the reserve grant head -
+there are critical differences in behaviour between them that provides the
+forwards progress guarantees that rolling permanent transactions require.
+
+These differences when a permanent transaction is rolled and the internal "log
+count" reaches zero and the initial set of unit reservations have been
+exhausted. At this point, we still require a log space reservation to continue
+the next transaction in the sequeunce, but we have none remaining. We cannot
+sleep during the transaction commit process waiting for new log space to become
+available, as we may end up on the end of the FIFO queue and the items we have
+locked while we sleep could end up pinning the tail of the log before there is
+enough free space in the log to fulfil all of the pending reservations and
+then wake up transaction commit in progress.
+
+To take a new reservation without sleeping requires us to be able to take a
+reservation even if there is no reservation space currently available. That is,
+we need to be able to *overcommit* the log reservation space. As has already
+been detailed, we cannot overcommit physical log space. However, the reserve
+grant head does not track physical space - it only accounts for the amount of
+reservations we currently have outstanding. Hence if the reserve head passes
+over the tail of the log all it means is that new reservations will be throttled
+immediately and remain throttled until the log tail is moved forward far enough
+to remove the overcommit and start taking new reservations. In other words, we
+can overcommit the reserve head without violating the physical log head and tail
+rules.
+
+As a result, permanent transactions only "regrant" reservation space during
+xfs_trans_commit() calls, while the physical log space reservation - tracked by
+the write head - is then reserved separately by a call to xfs_log_reserve()
+after the commit completes. Once the commit completes, we can sleep waiting for
+physical log space to be reserved from the write grant head, but only if one
+critical rule has been observed::
+
+	Code using permanent reservations must always log the items they hold
+	locked across each transaction they roll in the chain.
+
+"Re-logging" the locked items on every transaction roll ensures that the items
+attached to the transaction chain being rolled are always relocated to the
+physical head of the log and so do not pin the tail of the log. If a locked item
+pins the tail of the log when we sleep on the write reservation, then we will
+deadlock the log as we cannot take the locks needed to write back that item and
+move the tail of the log forwards to free up write grant space. Re-logging the
+locked items avoids this deadlock and guarantees that the log reservation we are
+making cannot self-deadlock.
+
+If all rolling transactions obey this rule, then they can all make forwards
+progress independently because nothing will block the progress of the log
+tail moving forwards and hence ensuring that write grant space is always
+(eventually) made available to permanent transactions no matter how many times
+they roll.
+
+
+Re-logging Explained
+====================
+
+XFS allows multiple separate modifications to a single object to be carried in
+the log at any given time.  This allows the log to avoid needing to flush each
+change to disk before recording a new change to the object. XFS does this via a
+method called "re-logging". Conceptually, this is quite simple - all it requires
+is that any new change to the object is recorded with a *new copy* of all the
+existing changes in the new transaction that is written to the log.
