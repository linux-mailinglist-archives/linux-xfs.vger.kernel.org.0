Ok, I'll make that clearer.

If the remote value checksum fails validation, xfs_trans_read_buf will
collapse EFSBADCRC to EFSCORRUPTED.  It'll also take care of releasing
the buffer.

I agree that xfs_buf_read is a more logical choice here, but it doesn't
do those things and I think we'd be better off changing xfs_buf_read
(and _buf_get) to return EFSBADCRC/EFSCORRUPTED/ENOMEM.

Ok.

Yeah, we could keep that in the caller.

"Find any incore buffers associated with the remote attr value and mark
them stale so they go away."

Yeah, I was 90% convinced of that too.  That'll be another prep patch.
