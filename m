Yes. Fedora is one. With it, we can use btrfs on zoned devices (and zonefs too)
but not XFS because they do not enable XFS_RT. So I can send a patch for their
kernel config to see if they would accept it. And do the same for many other
distros that have a similar config.

Or this patch to solve this in one go...

Yes, getting XFS_RT enabled through distros is the other solution. A lot more
painful though.

Sure, that can be done.

Hmmm... which would be a problem. But I guess I have to take that to the distros ?

So is it a hard no for the XFS_RT automatic select ?

At the very least, I will send a v2 with the KConfig help update only to
clarify the XFS_RT requirement for zoned devices.

OK. I can keep it in the same place it was and add the zoned device
clarification after it.
