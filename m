Looks fine to me.

THe only user I know of is xfsdump, and it will only use this
functionality if a special CLI option is given to it. Given that
this would just be writing zeros as this is what will be in the
inodes that are backed up by xfsdump, I don't see it a big problem
if this fails now.

Nothing else out there is likely to be using this ioctl - the DMAPI
state was specific to a long dead proprietary SGI HSM product and
that's the only thing I know of that used this ioctl to set non-zero
values in the first place. 

Hence I think removing this ioctl has very little risk of userspace
regression.
