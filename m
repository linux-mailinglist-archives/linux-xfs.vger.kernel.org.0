@Dave,


I would consider myself a beginner with Linux file systems.  I'm not 
sure how to implement your suggestions.  If you have any suggested 
places to dig deeper, let me know.


When you say 'mount -o ro,norecovery <dev>', do you mean to boot the VM 
I'm having problems with and add this from the prompt?  I'm not sure 
what <dev> is.  I assume you mean /dev/.... Also, I thought I had to add 
what is being mounted (e.g., image file).


So far, I've been using the xfs_repair that is build into the VM (CentOS 
7).  I've only accessed xfs_repair while in the emergency mode.  I'm not 
sure how to use another version; I didn't think the emergency mode had 
internet.


Can you give me more direction in how to execute on your suggestions?


Thank you again for your help.  I appreciate all the help.


Brian
