I don't think it is particular useful kernel wide. If it was, the
maintainer wouldn't have introduced a per-workqueue flag for this
functionality.

The reality is that very few workqueues in the system can expand out
into running thousands of kworker threads like the XFS workqueues
often do. And, really, there's nothing useful a typical user can do
at this point with the workqueue knobs to "tune" the behaviour - the
visibility/control the workqueue sysfs knobs provide at this point
is really only useful to XFS developers running tests in controlled
conditions...

Cheers,

Dave.
