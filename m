From what I'm seeing, a generic, arbitrary relogging mechanism based
on a reservation stealing concept similar to the CIL is going to be
simpler, less invasive, easier to expand in future and more robust
than this "limited scope" proposal.

I'm firmly in the "do it right the first time" camp here...
