Not that I can think of.  The SYNC/!SYNC decision is entirely based on
the caller's state, which (ime) makes me think harder any time I have to
reason about the {block,inode}gc function calls.

The dirty/writeback flag testing in xfs_prep_free_cowblocks exists for
correctness -- any time there's live cow staging blocks (as opposed to
speculative preallocations) it skips that inode.
