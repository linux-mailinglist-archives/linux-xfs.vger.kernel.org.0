Ah, right, because flags == 0, so we clear b_error anyway.

<nod> Thinking about this further -- if the earlier da3_node_read
reads a corrupt buffer off disk, it'll exit early, and if the AIL
happens to push the buffer and the write verifier fails, the log will be
dead, so there's no value added by probing bp->b_error.  I'll remove the
whole if block entirely.

xfs_trans_get_buf doesn't check b_error on the buffer it returns.  I
think only the _read_buf variants actually look at that.

Done.
