Even talking about it in terms on "inodegc" seems like
misdirection to me. Now I understand what this flush is working
around, it is clear to me that swapon could race the same way with
any other operation that removes extents from cloned files (e.g.
hole punch, truncate, etc).

however, from a user perspective, the only one that matters -right
now- is unlink because of the deferred processing of extent removal.

But even that isn't a guarantee - if something else has that cloned
file open, then the unlinked inode won't be queued for inodegc
and so swapon will still fail regardless of the inodegc flush.

Hence I think this needs to explain the race with extent removal and
cloned files, then explain that the inodegc flush is a workaround
that applies only to a specific corner case w.r.t. unlinking clones
before swapon is run. 

Something like:

/*
 * Swap file activation is can race against concurrent shared extent
 * removal in files that have been cloned. If this happens,
 * iomap_swapfile_iter() can fail because it encountered a shared
 * extent even though an operation is in progress to remove those
 * shared extents.
 *
 * This race becomes problematic when we defer extent removal
 * operations beyond the end of a syscall (i.e. use async background
 * processing algorithms). Users think the extents are no longer
 * shared, but iomap_swapfile_iter() still sees them as shared
 * because the refcountbt entries for the extents being removed have
 * not yet been updated. Hence the swapon call fails unexpectedly.
 *
 * The race condition is currently most obvious from the unlink()
 * operation as extent removal is deferred until after the last
 * reference to the inode goes away. We then process the extent
 * removal asynchronously, hence triggers the "syscall completed but
 * work not done" condition mentioned above. To close this race
 * window, we need to flush any pending inodegc operations to ensure
 * they have updated the refcountbt records before we try to map the
 * swapfile.
 */

This explains the race condition we are working around, and it gives
enough information to document that any other refcountbt updates we
defer to background processing (either removals or inserts!) are
going to need to be synchronised here.
