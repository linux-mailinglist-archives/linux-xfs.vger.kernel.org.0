Thanks, I've added this to for-next and I'll include it in the pull
req to Linus tomorrow because I don't want expose everyone using
merge window kernels to this ENOSPC issue even for a short while.

I used su=64k,sw=2 so I didn't see those specific issues. Mostly I
see failures due to mkfs warnings like this:

    +Warning: AG size is a multiple of stripe width.  This can cause performance
    +problems by aligning all AGs on the same disk.  To avoid this, run mkfs with
    +an AG size that is one stripe unit smaller or larger, for example 129248.

Yeah, I've had xfs_repair hang in xfs/155 a couple of times. Killing
the xfs_repair process allows everything to keep going. I suspect
it's a prefetch race/deadlock...
