I'll address the srcu vs. blocking choice in the thread for the next
patch.

I have plans to use the live hooks for more than just online scrub.
If we ever get around to reimplementing xfs_reno (see patchriver #4 for
a somewhat racy userspace version) in the kernel, it would be helpful
for reno to be able to keep an eye on any other directory link changes
while we're trying to renumber things.

As for DRAIN_INTENTS, userspace takes advantage of some of the
XFS_ONLINE_SCRUB code but doesn't need the intent drain because libxfs
isn't properly multithreaded.

You could even send it now; I don't think there's much chance that
Chandan will merge this patchset for 6.8, whereas I think the kconfig
cleanup would be fine for the merge window.
