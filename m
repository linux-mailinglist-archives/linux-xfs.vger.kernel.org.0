We discussed this in the original thread. See [1] (the tail end of my
mail is where we switch from general relogging discussion to the
quotaoff prototype) and your immediate reply for reference. The synopsis
is that I think a percpu rwsem around transaction allocation (what I've
replaced this patch with) is far more straightforward to audit, test and
maintain than annotating quota modifying transactions purely for the
purpose of quotaoff.

Sure, pause/resume seems fine to me.
