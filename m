I think it's funcionally harmless since this item would never be in a
situation where that flag has an effect. FWIW, I was never a big fan of
the iop_release() factoring and it hasn't really grown on me since. I
routinely have to double/triple check these callbacks where I didn't
before, especially when we have to consider things like this behavior
altering flag and cases where some of the other callbacks route back
into the release callback, etc.
