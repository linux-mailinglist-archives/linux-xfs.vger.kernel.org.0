That all sounds reasonable to me. You basically end up with a pass, fail
or "fs too busy/inconclusive, retry with blocking enabled" status. I
still don't really see the point of even temporarily putting the
variance check after the passing check though. If the current gap in the
feature is the blocking mechanism, as a user, I'd still prefer to see
the "too busy" status in the meantime over some semi-false "everything
checks out" status. At least then I know to either run a check during
downtime or to stop whatever fs activity is going on to get a legitimate
result. As it is, a user could be running this check repeatedly
concurrent with a workload that would never satisfy the variance check
even if it found something wrong and thus not even be aware the check is
simply a waste of time.

That said, it's not a big deal to me if this is all WIP and we're moving
in the direction where the "too much variance" state overrides the
pass/fail state (in the non blocking scrub) once all the parts are in
place..

That works for me. With those comment fixups in place:
