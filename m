xfs_log_write_unmount_record() clears the XLOG_TIC_INITED
flag before calling xlog_write(), so the current code never writes
out a start record for the unmount record. i.e. the unmount
record is a single region with the unmount log item in it, and
AFAICT this code does not change the behaviour of the unmount record
write at all.

FWIW, that error injection code looks dodgy - it turns the unmount
record into an XFS_LOG transaction type with an invalid log item
type (0). That probably should be flagged as corruption, not be
silently ignored by recovery. IOWs, I think the error injection code
was wrong to begin with - if we want to ensure the log is dirty at
unmount, we should just skip writing the unmount record altogether.

Cheers,

Dave.
