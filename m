Yeah, I don't quite like manually tromping through the defer ops state
machine here either.  Everywhere /else/ in XFS logs an EFI and finishes
it to free the space.  Just to make sure we're on the same page, newbt
will allocate space, log an EFI, and then:

1. Use the space and log an EFD for the space to cancel the EFI
2. Use some of the space, log an EFD for the space we used, immediately
   log a new EFI for the unused parts, and finish the new EFI manually
3. Don't use any of the space at all, and finish the EFI manually

Initially, I tried using the regular defer ops mechanism, but this got
messy on account of having to extern most of xfs_defer.c so that I could
manually modify the defer ops state.  It's hard to generalize this,
since there's only *one* place that actually needs manual flow control.

ISTR that was around the time bfoster and I were reworking log intent
item recovery, and it was easier to do this outside of the defer ops
code than try to refactor it and keep this exceptional piece working
too.

That's the final form of it.  The good news is that it's been stable
enough despite me tearing into the EFI code again in the rt
modernization patchset.  Do you have any further suggestions?
