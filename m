Yes, atomic clear+write new data. The ability to atomic clear requires
either a CPU with the ability to overwrite cachelines without doing a
RMW cycle (MOVDIR64B), or it requires a device with a suitable
slow-path mailbox command like the one defined for CXL devices (see
section 8.2.9.5.4.3 Clear Poison in CXL 2.0).

I don't know why you think these devices don't perform wear-leveling
with spare blocks?

It would because the implementations would need to be careful to clear
poison in an entire page before any of it could be accessed. With an
enlightened write-path RWF flag or custom fault handler it could do
sub-page overwrites of poison. Not that I think the driver should
optimize for multiple failed cachelines in a page, but it does mean
dax_clear_poison() fails in more theoretical scenarios.

Yes, but after the fight to even get copy_mc_to_kernel() to exist for
pmem_copy_to_iter() I did not have the nerve to push for wider usage.

All kernel accesses do use it. They either route to
pmem_copy_to_iter(), or like dm-writecache, call it directly. Do you
see a kernel path that does not use that helper?

dax_clear_poison() is at least ready to go today and does not preclude
adding the atomic and finer grained support later.
