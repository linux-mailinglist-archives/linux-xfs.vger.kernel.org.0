Oh, ok, so repair is walking the uncertain inode chunks to see if they
really correspond to inodes.  Having decided that the chunk is good, the
last little piece is to check that the uncertain chunk doesn't overlap
with any of the known-good chunks, and if /that/ passes, repair moves
the uncertain chunk to inode_tree_ptrs[]?  And therefore it makes no
sense at all to compare one uncertain chunk against the rest of the
uncertain chunks, because (a) that's where it just came from and (b) we
could discard any of the remaining uncertain chunks?

If the answers are yes and yes, then:

Though you might want to augment the commit message to include that last
sentence about why it doesn't make sense to check the uncertain ichunk
list, since that's where I tripped up. :/

Looks like a reasonably good candidate for an fstest :)
