We've not been especially consistent with that -- I think you can
"upgrade" to meta_uuid; at one point Christoph had a series to make it
possible to upgrade to reflink; but all the other features don't support
upgrades.

I picked inobtcount for the initial v5 upgrade support because it seemed
like a small enough feature that people could theoretically backport the
feature to old kernels.  That was supposed to go in ahead of y2038
support (which is my real motivation for allowing some upgrades) but
then they both landed at the same time. ;)

I think the only features that we've supported downgrading are attr2 ->
attr1 and (in the old days) unwritten extents.
