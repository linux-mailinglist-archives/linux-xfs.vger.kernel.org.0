I'd be happy to go through the sets and find the intersections. Or make 
a big super set if you like.  I got the impression though that Christoph 
didnt particularly like the delayed attr series or the idea of blending 
them.  But I do think it would be a good idea to take into consideration 
what the combination of them is going to look like.
