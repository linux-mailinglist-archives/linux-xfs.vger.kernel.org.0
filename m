Then could that part of the xfs code be converted to use
iomap->validity_cookie so that struct iomap_writepage_ctx can be
eliminated?

We don't need to validate an iomap "at any time". It's two specific
places in the code in which we need to check, and we're not going to
end up with ten more such places tomorrow. I'd prefer to keep those
filesystem internals in the filesystem specific code instead of
exposing them to the iomap layer. But that's just me ...

If we ignore this particular commit for now, do you have any
objections to the patches in this series? If not, it would be great if
we could add the other patches to iomap-for-next.

By the way, I'm still not sure if gfs2 is affected by this whole iomap
validation drama given that it neither implements unwritten extents
nor delayed allocation. This is a mess.

Thanks,
Andreas
