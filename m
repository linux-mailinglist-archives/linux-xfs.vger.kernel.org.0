Is a SYNC walk safe to run here? I know we run
xfs_blockgc_free_space() from XFS_IOC_FREE_EOFBLOCKS under
SB_FREEZE_WRITE protection, but here we have both frozen writes and
page faults we're running in a much more constrained freeze context
here.

i.e. the SYNC walk will keep busy looping if it can't get the
IOLOCK_EXCL on an inode that is in cache, so if we end up with an
inode locked and blocked on SB_FREEZE_WRITE or SB_FREEZE_PAGEFAULT
for whatever reason this will never return....

Cheers,

Dave.
