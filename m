The "noinline" here is really "noinline_for_stack", but it predates
the noinline_for_stack annotation and never got updated. i.e.
the noinline was added because of the historic stack usage problems
we had with 4k stacks on x86 and 8k stacks on x86-64. We had to
split large functions up to reduce the number of on-stack variables
in them, but that was then being undone by the compiler deciding to
automatically inline single use static functions.

I know the x86-64 stack issues have gone away now we have
CONFIG_VMAP_STACK, but people can still turn that off so we still
have to be careful about stack usage caused by inlining single use
functions...

Hence I'm not sure we can just remove this - we'd need to go back
and investigate what impact it has on stack usage in the writeback
allocation path and other historic problematic code paths to
determine if they should still be annotated or not. They could be
converted with s/STATIC/static noinline_for_stack/ on a case by case
basis, and then the rest could probably just be case converted with
sed...

Cheers,

Dave.
