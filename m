I'm sure you can find somewhere where it is remotely relevant. ;) The
only relevant bits I see here are the last few sentences or so that
describe how the function should behave. The rest of the background
doesn't belong here. ISTM that a more appropriate place would be either
the caller of ->reconfigure or perhaps the header where
fs_context_operations is defined. At minimum, you can always leave it in
the commit log.
