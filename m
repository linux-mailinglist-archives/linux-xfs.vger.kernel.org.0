Sorry about the missing signed-off-by, I really need to have a
check-list before posting patches...or send more patches :-).

OK, I'll do this in the next version.

OK, sincerely thank you for the 'rules-of-thump'. However, In the
first version of the patch set I grouped the changes into way less patches
and passed along a question about the preferred granularity of patches
and got the following answer:

However, I agree that I should have mentioned that some patches would
be too small and not blindly follow the request...I'll do better next
time.

I believe this is because of patch #6 - xfsprogs: Stop using 
platform_uuid_copy()

Here I dropped the usage of platform_uuid_copy() even in libxfs by:

1) removing the uuid_copy() macro that was implemented by calling
    platform_uuid_copy() in libxfs/libxfs_priv.h

  -#define uuid_copy(s,d) platform_uuid_copy((s),(d))

2) using directly standard uuid_copy() instead
    Which resulted into plenty of trivial changes all over libxfs, the
    core of the changes being that uuid params are passed-by-value to
    standard uuid_copy(), but to libxfs' uuid_copy() it is
    passed-by-reference.

    E.g.
- uuid_copy(&agf->agf_uuid, &mp->m_sb.sb_meta_uuid);
+               uuid_copy(agf->agf_uuid, mp->m_sb.sb_meta_uuid);
