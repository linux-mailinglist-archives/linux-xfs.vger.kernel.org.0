So my new test actually blows up before creating intents:

[   81.695529] XFS (nvme1n1): Mounting V5 Filesystem 07057234-4bec-4f17-97c5-420c71c83292

Because sb_dblocks hasn't been updated yet.  I'd kinda assume we run
into the intents next, but maybe we don't.  I can try how far just
fixing the sb would get us, but that will potentially gets us into
more problems late the more we actually use the pag structure.

I actually did that earlier, and it turned out to create a bit more
boilerplate than I liked, but I can revert to it if there is a strong
preference.

Mostly to keep the features in sync with the in-memory sb fields
updated above.  I'll switch to keep this as-is, but I fail to see how
updating features only after the entire reocvery is done will be safe
for all cases either.

Where would we depend on the old feature setting?

Yes, and the way how xfs_initialize_perag it is an entire no-op.
But I can add an extra explicit check to make that more clear.
