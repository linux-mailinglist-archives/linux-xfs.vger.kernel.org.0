Yep.. Just putting the async deferred operations aside, maybe it is too
big for this patch, and focusing on the bug. Of course, we have alternative
solutions for the bug, if this patch is overkill (adding the log incompat bit).
I will try the lightweight and appropriate approaches discussed in the other
subthread, for example refactoring the dir code and move the xfs_iunlink_remove()
call to between the xfs_dir_canenter() and xfs_dir_createname().
