Yeah, linux has this weird idea that semaphores can only be accessed
from a single process context, like a mutex. We've beaten our head
against this many times, and it's the only reason struct semaphore
still exists and everything isn't a mutex.

rwsems now do crazy stuff like track the owner for spinning
optimisations, despite the fact it's a semaphore and, by definition,
can be released by non-owner contexts....

No, that's not a bug, that's how semaphores work - semaphores
protect the object, not the process context that took the lock.

i.e. the difference between a mutex and a semaphore is that the
mutex protects a code path from running concurrently with other
processes, while a semaphore protects an object from other accesses,
even when they don't have a process context associated with them
(e.g. while they are under IO).

Not really, it's just another "lockdep behaviour is wrong" issue we
have to work around. When we switch to a worker, we need to release
and acquire the lockdep context so that it thinks the current
process working on the object owns the lock.

rwsem_release() when the work is queued, rwsem_acquire() when the
work is run. And vice versa when the work is done.

Cheers,

Dave.
