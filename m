Oh yeah, I'd forgotten about that one, probably because I was out on
vacation for nearly all of that.

Thank you Dave & Eric for fixing this quickly.

I mostly disagree -- nag emails are a bit annoying when I'm under
stress, yes, but OTOH I would not (and am not) saying no to another set
of eyes who some day might see something we don't see, and nudge us.
Like you did here.  Or someday you might be the first to spot (say) some
cross-fs problem that isn't so obvious to the rest of us who are
concentrating on a single subsys/fs/whatever.

You can choose not to nag Dave, but please keep sending me stuff. :)
I'd rather have you write something and say no than have you not write
something and then we never hear about it.

Yeah, too bad a lot of xfs bugs are mismatches in thinking between
subcomponent authors & require deep analysis.  Occasionally we get
"lucky" and it's closer to the surface like the 6.3 corruption thing.
Other times it's broken stuff hiding deep.

I won't.  We're severely understaffed, and that problem just got
worse.

I saw the 39 rhbz sub-bugs from that one.  Wow.  What an abuse of
process to make you all endure that.
