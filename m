There was a known xfs crash bug fixed by e001873853d8 ("xfs: ensure
we capture IO errors correctly"), so trys to cover this bug and make
sure xfs can capture IO errors correctly, won't panic and hang again.

Hi,

When I tried to tidy up our internal test cases recently, I found a very
old case which trys to cover e001873853d8 ("xfs: ensure we capture IO errors
correctly") which fix by Dave. At that time, we didn't support xfs injection,
so we tested it by a systemtap script [1] to inject an ioerror.

Now this bug has been fixed long long time ago (9+ years), and that stap script
is already out of date, can't work with new kernel. But good news is we have xfs
injection now, so I try to resume this test case in fstests.

I didn't verify if this case can reproduce that bug on old rhel (which doesn't
support error injection). The original case tried to inject errno 11, I'm
not sure if it's worth trying more other errors. I searched "buf_ioerror" in
fstests, found nothing. So maybe this bug is old enough, but it's worth covering
this kind of test. So feel free to tell me if you have any suggestions :)

Thanks,
Zorro

probe module("xfs").function("xfs_buf_bio_end_io")
{
        if ($error == 0) {
                if ($bio->bi_rw & (1 << 4)) {
                        $error = -11;
                        printf("%s: comm %s, pid %d, setting error 11\n",
                                probefunc(), execname(), pid());
                        print_stack(backtrace());
                }
        }
}
