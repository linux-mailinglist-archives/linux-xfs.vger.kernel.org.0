I think there would be noticeable overhead from anything that requires
a 64-bit division to update a timestamp, or to read it into an in-memory
inode, especially on 32-bit architectures.

I think the reason why separate seconds/nanoseconds are easy is that
this is what both the in-kernel and user space interface are based around.
We clearly don't use the precision, but anything else is more expensive
at runtime.

I think from a user perspective, it would be the nicest to just add the
extra high bits (however many, I don't care) and treat it as an ro-compatible
extension, possibly even as completely compatible both ways.

Note that for any released kernel (5.4 changes this), this matches
the existing behavior: setting a timestamp after 2038 using utimensat()
silently wraps the seconds back to the regular epoch. With the
extension patch, you get the correct results as long as the inode was
both written and read on a new enough kernel, while all pre-5.4
kernels produce the same incorrect data that they always have.
