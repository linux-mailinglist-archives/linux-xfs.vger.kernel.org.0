There are some use cases that really like sector aligned direct I/O,
what comes to mind is some data bases, and file system repair tools
(the latter on the raw block device).  So it is nice to support, but not
really required.

So for now I'd much prefer to initially support inline encryption for
direct I/O without that if that simplifies the support.  We can revisit
the additional complexity later.

Also note that for cheap flash media pretending support for 512 byte
blocks is actually a bit awwkward, so just presenting the media as
having 4096 sectors in these setups would be the better choice anyway.
