I find this comment a bit unclear -- aren't we looping backwards from
where we last checked *downwards*?  I was reading "where we are now" to
mean @i, which contains a negative value.

"When @i is negative, we try to find a free extent that starts in the
bitmap blocks before bbno.  Starting from the last bitmap block that we
checked in a negative scan (initially bbno - 1) and walking downwards
towards (bbno + i), try to allocate an extent of satisfactory length."

But now having worked my way through that, now I'm wondering what the j
loop is even doing.  Doesn't the sequence of blocks that we call
xfs_rtallocate_extent_block on alternate backwards and forwards?  e.g.

Try to find a satisfactory free extent that starts in:

bbno
bbno + 1
bbno - 1
bbno + 2
bbno - 2
...
etc?

Why not avoid the loop entirely by calling xfs_rtallocate_extent_block
on bbno + i once before switching back to positive @i?  What am I
missing here?

Changing the j > i to j >= i is what obviates the extra call to
xfs_rtallocate_extent_block below, correct?
