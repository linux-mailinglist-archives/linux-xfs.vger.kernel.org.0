Ok, that looks good - it definitely gets rid of a lot of the
nastiness, but I have to ask: why does it need to be based on
xfs_bufs?  That's just wasting 300 bytes of memory on a handle to
store a key and a opaque blob in a rhashtable.

IIUC, the key here is a sequential index, so an xarray would be a
much better choice as it doesn't require internal storage of the
key.

i.e.

	p = xa_load(key);
	if (p)
		return p;

	xfs_attr_get(key);
	if (!args->value)
		/* error */

	/*
	 * store the current value, freeing any old value that we
	 * replaced at this key. Don't care about failure to store,
	 * this is optimistic caching.
	 */
	p = xa_store(key, args->value, GFP_NOFS);
	if (p)
		kvfree(p);
	return args->value;

-Dave.
