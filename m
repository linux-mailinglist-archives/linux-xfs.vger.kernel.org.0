I can take the explanation which is in the git commit description and
move it into the comment.

Again, I believe patch #2 does what you want; if it doesn't can you
explain why passing I_DIRTY_TIME_EXPIRED to s_op->dirty_inode() isn't
"a new lazytime expired operation that makes very clear what is
happening"?

I separated out patch #1 and patch #2 because patch #1 preserves
current behavior, and patch #2 modifies XFS code, which I don't want
to push Linus without an XFS reviewed-by.

N.b.  None of the other file systems required a change for patch #2,
so if you want, we can have the XFS tree carry patch #2, and/or
combine that with whatever other simplifying changes that you want.
Or I can combine patch #1 and patch #2, with an XFS Reviewed-by, and
send it through the ext4 tree.

What's your pleasure?
