It's been a while since I've looked at any of this and I haven't waded
through all of the details, so I could easily be missing something, but
what exactly is wrong with the approach of the patch as posted?

Commit 12818d24db ("xfs: rework log recovery to submit buffers on LSN
boundaries") basically created a new invariant for log recovery where
buffers are allowed to be written only once per LSN. The risk otherwise
is that a subsequent update with a matching LSN would not be correctly
applied due to the v5 LSN ordering rules. Since log recovery processes
transactions (using terminology/granularity as defined by the
implementation of xlog_recover_commit_trans()), this required changes to
accommodate any of the various possible runtime logging scenarios that
could cause a buffer to have multiple entries in the log associated with
a single LSN, the details of which were orthogonal to the fix.

The functional change therefore was that rather than to process and
submit "transactions" in sequence during recovery, the pending buffer
list was lifted to a higher level in the code, a tracking field was
added for the "current LSN" of log recovery, and only once we cross a
current LSN boundary are we allowed to submit the set of buffers
processed for the prior LSN. The reason for this logic is that seeing
the next LSN was really the only way we know we're done processing items
for a particular LSN.

If I understand the problem description correctly, the issue here is
that if an error is encountered in the middle of processing items for
some LSN A, we bail out of recovery and submit the pending buffers on
the way out. If we haven't completed processing all items for LSN A
before failing, however, then we've just possibly violated the "write
once per LSN" invariant that protects from corrupting the fs. This is
because the writeback permanently updates metadata LSNs (assuming that
I/O doesn't fail), which means if recovery retries from the same point
the next time around and progresses to find a second instance of an
already written buffer in LSN A, it will exhibit the same general
behavior from before the write once invariant was introduced. IOW,
there's still a vector to the original problematic multi-write per LSN
behavior through multiple recovery attempts (hence the simulated I/O
error to reproduce).

Long Li, am I following the problem description correctly? I've not
fully reviewed it, but if so, the proposed solution seems fairly sane
and logical to me. (And nice work tracking this down, BTW, regardless of
whether this is the final solution. ;).
