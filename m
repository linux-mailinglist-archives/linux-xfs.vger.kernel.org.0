Sort of... the idea is more to reduce code duplication across the
currently separate codepaths to hopefully reduce the number of states
required. Note that the intent isn't to simplify away the state machine
approach entirely, but to simply reduce the number of states so the
resulting complexity of the set path is more in line with the remove
path. Given that, I'm not sure why this would imply we'd need to retain
the transaction loop, for example. I'd expect your subsequent
infrastructure changes and general state management approach to remain
fundamentally the same, only hopefully with fewer branches/states.

Indeed, it may be possible to do this kind of thing before or after the
infrastructure changes. I highly suspect the latter might seem more
simple to you being more familiar with the new code while the former
might seem more simple to somebody like me who is much less so. ;)

As above, note that I'm definitely not attempting to simplify the
broader pattern away. Just exploring cleanups to the xattr set code to
reduce the complexity of the transition. The reason the patch I posted
doesn't have any state management is IIRC I only went as far as possible
before we'd probably need to define the first state. ;)

The current organization of the code is what concerns me moreso than the
broader infrastructure or state patterns in general. IOW, I don't
actually see an obvious pattern emerge from reading through
xfs_attr_set_iter(), for example. I see some state code that jumps into
format helpers, followed by shortform code and then leaf/node addname
calls into similar or related calls seen at the top. This diverges from
the previously discussed goal of seeing all of the state management bits
at one level such that the execution flow of the operation is as obvious
as possible. Hence, I'm wondering if the reduced number of states
facilitates that goal, but perhaps I could dig further into it from that
angle as well...
