FWIW, I don't like the "freezer" based naming here. It's too easily
confused with freezing and thawing the filesystem....

I know, "delayed deferred ops" isn't much better, but at least it
won't get confused with existing unrelated functionality.

I've barely looked at the code, so no real comments on that yet,
but I did notice this:

Can overflow when freeblks > (UINT_MAX / 15).

Cheers,
