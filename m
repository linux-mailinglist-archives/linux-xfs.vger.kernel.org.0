/me shrugs

All I really want is the macros converted to static inlines so that
we get proper type checking. I'm not concerned by upper/lower case
that much, and for stuff like XFS_I/VFS_I I agree that it makes
sense because they are really short and it makes the type
conversions of related embedded objects stand out in the code
nicely.

But for longer stuff like xfs_ifork_ptr(), I think it makes more
sense to follow the "UPPER == macro, lower == static inline"
conventions, especially in the dense forest of similar macro
definitions surrounding XFS_IFORK_... and XFS_DFORK...

Yes, it does mean there's a little bit of eye retraining to be done
for long term developers, but I think the end result is much more
easier to understand especially for people new to the XFS code....

One of many. :/

Cheers,
