Not that much overhead.  A child directory can only be unlinked if it's
empty; empty directories by definition contain only a dotdot entry,
which meanns they're in shortform format; and we already have to log the
inode to reflect the i_nlinks change.

I'll address that in the other thread suggesting I "just fix the
verifiers".

Parent pointers haven't been merged yet; this is the '..' entry that
has been stored in every directory since the beginning.
