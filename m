Right.. but does anything actually care about that level of granularity
right now beyond having a nicer error message?

Ok.

Yeah, fair point, though I guess it depends on the particular library.

I was thinking of having a per-device libxfs_device_flush() along the
lines of libxfs_device_close() and separating out that functionality,
but one could argue we're also a bit inconsistent between libxfs_init()
opening the devices and having to close them individually. I think
having libxfs_umount() do a proper purge -> flush and returning any
errors instead is a fair tradeoff for simplicity. Removing the
flush_devices() API also eliminates risk of somebody incorrectly
attempting the flush after the umount frees the buftarg structures
(without reinitializing pointers :P).
