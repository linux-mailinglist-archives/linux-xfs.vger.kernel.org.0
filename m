Yes, I'll need to fix that.

No breakage noticed during my testing, but I'm not sure how that
would have materialized anyway..

The problem is that if we allow the full range, but return a smaller
around generic/260 fails.  That is with your patches to not fail if
FITRIM for the RT device is supported, without them it always fails
as soon as FITRIM is supported on the RT device.
