Oops, sorry, forgot to reply to this.

The per-AG reservations shouldn't be a problem on a modern kernel
because we assume an internal log never moves or grows, so we only need
to account for rmap/refcount btree expansions to cover space used
elsewhere in the AG.  That said, *one* block is cutting it really close.

Also, earlier kernels (4.9 era) weren't smart about that, though 4.9 is
dead according to gregkh and any kernel that says rmap/reflink are
experimental should not be used.

The problem that I saw is that you could trick the default calculations
into making the log to consume so much space that either (a) the root
directory gets allocated in the next AG, or if you were <cough>
formatting a single AG then mkfs just exits with a cryptic message about
ENOSPC.

It's fairly difficult to trigger this for a plain old block device, but
if mkfs thinks the disk has a gigantic stripe unit, it'll go around
putting the root directory at a much higher block number than is usual.
For the most part the "max_ag_blocks - 1" was actually fine, but not so
much for the case where the AG size is close to 64MB.

So in the end the 5% figure is still rather handwavy wormcanning.

<nod> I guess the same limits ought to be applied to explicit logsize to
improve the "Well if it hurts don't do that!" experience. ;)

<nod> I'll try to add a sample mkfs failure to the commit message.
