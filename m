I think we have similar goals. I'd like to eventually generalize
what you have done for enablement through *any* cloud.

And, I suspect this may not just be useful for kernel development too
and so there is value in that for other things.

It may make sense for us to consider containers for some of this.

If a distro doesn't have one, for example, well then we just have
to do the build-it-all-step.

You are misunderstanding the goal with 'make bringup', if you already
have pre-built images you can use them and you have less to do. You
*don't* have to run 'make fstests' if you already have that set up.

'make bringup' just abstracts general initial stage nodes, whether on
cloud or local virt.

'make linux' however does get / build / install linux.

And for local virtualization there whedre vagrant images are used
one could enhance these further too. They are just compressed tarball
with a qcow2 file at least when libvirt is used. Since kdevops works off
of these, you can then also use pre-built images with all kernel/modules
need and even binaries. I've extended docs recently to help folks who wish
to optimize on that front:

https://github.com/linux-kdevops/kdevops/blob/master/docs/custom-vagrant-boxes.md

Each stage has its own reproducible builds aspect to it.

So if one *had* these enhanced vagrant images with kernels, one could
just skip the build stage and jump straight to testing after bringup.

I do wonder if we could share simiular qcow2 images for cloud testing
too and for vagrant. If we could... there is a pretty big win.

Yup.

Yes I realize that. No one typically has time to do that. Which is why
when I had my requirements from a prior $employer to do the tech do
something cloud agnostic, I decided it was tech best shared. It was not
easy.

Every developer may have a different way to work and do Linux kernel
development.

The above just explained what you *don't* want to do, not what you want.
But you explained to me in private a while ago you expect to do local
test builds fast to guest.

I think you're just missing that the goal is to support variability
and enable that variability. If such variability is not supported
then its just a matter of adding a few kconfig options and then
adding support for it. So yes its possible and its a matter of
taking a bit of time to do that workflow. My kdev workflow was to
just work with large guests before, and use 'localmodconfig' kernels
which are very small, and so build time is fast, specially after the
first build. The other worklow I then supported was the distro world
one where we tested a "kernel of the day" which is a kernel on a repo
somewhere. So upgradng is just ensuring you have a repo and `zypper in`
the kernel, reboot and test.

To support the workflow you have I'd like to evaluate both a local virt
solution and cloud (for any cloud vendor). For local virt using 9p seems to
make sense. For cloud, not so sure.

I think we really digress from the subject at hand though. This
conversation is useful but it really is just noise to a lot of people.
