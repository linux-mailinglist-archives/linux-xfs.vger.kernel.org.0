Ah.  Yes, it does depend on the synchronous file io nature of pmem.  I
/think/ you could simulate the same thing (which is to say the lack of
delalloc writes) by mounting with -osync.

The primary issue is the occasional failure of x/227 on the maintainer's
testing system. :P

The secondary issue is sporadic undiagnosed internal complaints which
are nearly impossible to do much triage on, due to an amazingly s****y
iscsi network that drops so much traffic you can't collect any
telemetry.

The tertiary(?) issue is that "fortunately" the atomic file update
series + fsx have proven good at testing the weaknesses of the block
reservation calculations for swap extents.
