Thanks for doing this! It looks find overall from a quick look. Mind
adding some words in README file as well?

The group files are auto-generated correctly upon "make", but "make
group" printed tons of errors like:

I think it's better to let 'make group' work as well, it might be easier
to re-generated just group files.

I noticed that your patches are based on your internal base, and this
branch couldn't be pulled into current master branch. But this is fine
for RFC patches I think :)
