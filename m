FYI, the commit log doesn't match the git branch referenced in the cover
letter.

Any reason the NULL check isn't in the previous patch?

Logic looks backwards, we should relog (not skip) if li_lsn is within
the threshold, right?

I suspect this churn is eliminated if this code uses the threshold logic
from the start..

Separate refactoring patch for the xfs_log.c bits, please.
