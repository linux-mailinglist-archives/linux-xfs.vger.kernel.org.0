Excellent first pass, Peter. It explained a lot of little things I
was missing. :)

So these are accessed by the task_rq_lock() and rq_lock()
interfaces, right? And we take clock locks inside these because we
need to update timestamps/task clocks when tasks are first
scheduled?

What are all the rq_*pin_[un]lock() calls and how do they
factor into this?

Ok, I'm guessing this is when task migration is being performed?

That's ttwu_queue_wakelist()?

I'm a little confused as to where ttwu_remote() fits into remote
wakeups, though. That piece of the puzzle hasn't dropped into place
yet...

OK. Might be worthwhile iterating the objects that have this "stable
with one lock, modified under both locks" structures...

/me goes code spelunking

Ok, so those comments talk about "using a barrier" to order p->state
changes against external logic to avoid wakeup races, not about how
they are ordered or used internally. 

But it also mentions that the barrier matches with a full barrier in
wake_up_state() and that calls straight into ttwu(). Ah, so that's
what this "CONDITION" is - it's the external wakeup checks!

        /*                                                                       
         * If we are going to wake up a thread waiting for CONDITION we          
         * need to ensure that CONDITION=1 done by the caller can not be         
         * reordered with p->state check below. This pairs with mb() in          
         * set_current_state() the waiting thread does.                          
         */                                                                      
        raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&p->pi_lock, flags);                               
        smp_mb__after_spinlock();                                                
        if (!(p->state & state))                                                 
                goto unlock;

My brain now connects this straight to well known task sleep/wakeup
code patterns, and this bit now makes a lot more sense....

This. 1000x this. That's exactly the sort of basic, high level
relationship I've been unable to pull out of the code. Forest,
trees, all that jive. Lots of disconnected fragments fell into place
when I read that.

Thank you! :)

why? It's good to document the rule, but I haven't been able to find
an obvious explanation of why this rule exists....

What's the reason for it being under different locks if it's already
in runnable state? i.e. the lock that needs to be held is spelled
out on set_task_cpu():

        * The caller should hold either p->pi_lock or rq->lock, when changing
	*a task's CPU. ->pi_lock for waking tasks, rq->lock for runnable tasks.

But there's no explanation there or here of why the different locks
need to be used or how the two different situations don't
overlap/contend/race because they aren't holding the same locks. So
while I know rule exists, I don't understand the relationship
or logic that the rule emerges from.

I've not dug deeply enough into the migration code in recent times
to be able to comment sanely on these...
