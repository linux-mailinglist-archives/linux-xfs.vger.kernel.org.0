Looks good, I went through the analysis yesterday when you mentioned
it on #xfs. Minor nit below, otherwise:

Rather than describe how inodes might be skipped here, the
constraint we are operating under should be described. That is:

	/*
	 * We need to clear out all remaining COW staging extents so
	 * that we don't leave inodes requiring modifications during
	 * inactivation and reclaim on a read-only mount. We must
	 * check and process every inode currently in memory, hence
	 * this requires a synchronous inode cache scan to be
	 * executed.
	 */

Cheers,

Dave.
