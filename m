Correct. Writeback puts the correct value into the on-disk inode.

Yes.

This is the first time I recall seeing it - it jumped out at me
immediately as a big red flag that something was wrong as I worked
my way through each inode in the cluster that repair found errors
in.

Maybe we need an occasional "remove incompat cruft" feature bit to
batch little stuff like this together...

*nod*

Once backported, we don't have to really care whether the LSN is
valid or not, just whether the kernel performs recovery correctly or
not. I suspect we also need a verifier check on this - if the inode
is allocated, the LSN should not be zero. And if it is zero, we
immediately log the inode so it will get written back with a good
LSN. I suspect xfs_repair and scrub need to flag this, too.

Cheers,

Dave.
