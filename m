Hmm, maybe the *function* needs an explanation for why it's valid to use
rmtval_stale here:

/*
 * Invalidate any incore buffers associated with this remote attribute
 * value extent.   We never log remote attribute value buffers, which
 * means that they won't be attached to a transaction and are therefore
 * safe to mark stale.  The actual bunmapi will be taken care of later.
 */
STATIC int
xfs_attr3_rmt_inactive(
	struct xfs_inode	*dp,
	struct xfs_attr_inactive_list *lp)

I say the function is also confusingly named and could have its
arguments list trimmed.

Hmm, yeah, it's definitely wrong for the inactivation case -- the
inactivation thread holds the only incore reference to this unlinked
inode, so the buffer had better not be locked by another thread.

I'm not even all that sure why XBF_TRYLOCK is necessary in the remove
case, since we hold ILOCK_EXCL and there shouldn't be anyone else
messing around inside the xattr data.
