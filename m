What value does it provide LTS users?

This series adds almost no value to normal users - extent count
overflows are just something that doesn't happen in production
systems at this point in time. The largest data extent count I've
ever seen is still an order of magnitude of extents away from
overflowing (i.e. 400 million extents seen, 4 billion to overflow),
and nobody is using the attribute fork sufficiently hard to overflow
65536 extents (typically a couple of million xattrs per inode).

i.e. this series is ground work for upcoming internal filesystem
functionality that require much larger attribute forks (parent
pointers and fsverity merkle tree storage) to be supported, and
allow scope for much larger, massively fragmented VM image files
(beyond 16TB on 4kB block size fs for worst case
fragmentation/reflink). 

As a standalone patchset, this provides almost no real benefit to
users but adds a whole new set of "hard stop" error paths across
every operation that does inode data/attr extent allocation. i.e.
the scope of affected functionality is very wide, the benefit
to users is pretty much zero.

Hence I'm left wondering what criteria ranks this as a high value
change...

I prefer that the process doesn't result in taking random unnecesary
functionality into stable kernels. The part of the LTS process that
I've most disagreed with is the "backport random unnecessary
changes" part of the stable selection criteria. It doesn't matter if
it's selected by a bot or a human, the problems that causes are the
same.

Hence on those grounds, I'd say this isn't a stable backport
candidate at all...

Cheers,

Dave.
