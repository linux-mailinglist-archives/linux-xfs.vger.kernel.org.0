Hi all,

This set is a subset of a larger series for parent pointers. Delayed attributes
allow attribute operations (set and remove) to be logged and committed in the same
way that other delayed operations do. This allows more complex operations (like
parent pointers) to be broken up into multiple smaller transactions. To do
this, the existing attr operations must be modified to operate as a delayed
operation.  This means that they cannot roll, commit, or finish transactions.  
Instead, they return -EAGAIN to allow the calling function to handle the transaction.
In this series, we focus on only the delayed attribute portion. We will introduce
parent pointers in a later set.

At the moment, I would like people to focus their review efforts on just this
"delayed attribute" sub series, as I think that is a more conservative use of peoples
review time.  I also think the set is a bit much to manage all at once, and we
need to get the infrastructure ironed out before we focus too much anything
that depends on it. But I do have the extended series for folks that want to
see the bigger picture of where this is going.

To help organize the set, I've arranged the patches to make sort of mini sets.
I thought it would help reviewers break down the reviewing some. For reviewing
purposes, the set could be broken up into 2 phases:

Delay Ready Attributes: (patches 1-8)
These are the remaining patches belonging to the "Delay Ready" series that
we've been working with.  In these patches, transaction handling is removed
from the attr routines, and replaced with a state machine that allows a high
level function to roll the transaction and repeatedly recall the attr routines
until they are finished.  The behavior of the attr set/remove routines
are now also compatible as a .finish_item callback
  xfs: Add helper xfs_attr_node_remove_step
  xfs: Hoist transaction handling in xfs_attr_node_remove_step
  xfs: Add xfs_attr_node_remove_cleanup
  xfs: Add delay ready attr remove routines
  xfs: Add delay ready attr set routines
  xfs: Add statemachine tracepoints
  xfs: Rename __xfs_attr_rmtval_remove
  xfs: Handle krealloc errors in xlog_recover_add_to_cont_trans

Delayed Attributes: (patches 9 - 15)
These patches go on to fully implement delayed attributes.  New attr intent and
done items are introduced for use in the existing logging infrastructure.  A
mount option is added to toggle the feature on and off, and an error tag is added
to test the log replay
  xfs: Set up infastructure for deferred attribute operations
  xfs: Skip flip flags for delayed attrs
  xfs: Add xfs_attr_set_deferred and xfs_attr_remove_deferred
  xfs: Remove unused xfs_attr_*_args
  xfs: Add delayed attributes error tag
  xfs: Add delattr mount option
  xfs: Merge xfs_delattr_context into xfs_attr_item

Updates since v13: Mostly integrating review feed back, which involved quite
a few changes.  Most significant being the removal of the incompat flag which
has been replaced with a mount option.  Though we do need to set an incompat
flag, we cannot use it to enable/disable the feature.  It needs to be set when
ever a new log item is written to disk.  ATM, writing the flag to the super
block on the fly currently not supported, but overlaps with another work effort
that needs it for other reasons.  For now, writing new log entries to the disk
is simply disabled unless specified at mount time.

   NEW

This series can be viewed on github here:
https://github.com/allisonhenderson/xfs_work/tree/delay_ready_attrs_v14

As well as the extended delayed attribute and parent pointer series:
https://github.com/allisonhenderson/xfs_work/tree/delay_ready_attrs_v14_extended

And the test cases:
https://github.com/allisonhenderson/xfs_work/tree/pptr_xfstestsv2

In order to run the test cases, you will need have the corresponding xfsprogs
changes as well.  Which can be found here:
https://github.com/allisonhenderson/xfs_work/tree/delay_ready_attrs_xfsprogs_v14
https://github.com/allisonhenderson/xfs_work/tree/delay_ready_attrs_xfsprogs_v14_extended

To run the xfs attributes tests run:
check -g attr

To run as delayed attributes run:
export MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o delattr"
check -g attr

To run parent pointer tests:
check -g parent

I've also made the corresponding updates to the user space side as well, and ported anything
they need to seat correctly.

Questions, comment and feedback appreciated! 

Thanks all!
Allison
