I'm kinda surprised you don't just turn on alwayscow mode, use an
iomap_funshare-like function to read in and dirty pagecache (which will
hopefully create a new large cow fork mapping) and then flush it all
back out with writeback.  Then you don't need all this state tracking,
kthreads management, and copying file data through the buffer cache.
Wouldn't that be a lot simpler?
