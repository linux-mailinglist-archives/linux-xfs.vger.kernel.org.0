The kernel can sometimes make S_DAX changes take effect on its own,
provided that there are no other users of the file and the filesystem
agrees to reclaim an inode on file close and the program closes the file
after changing the bit.  None of these behaviors are guaranteed to
exist, so this is not mentioned in the documentation.

(And before anyone asks, yes, we did try to build a way to change the
file ops on the fly, but adding more concurrency control to all io paths
to handle an infrequent state change is not acceptable.)
