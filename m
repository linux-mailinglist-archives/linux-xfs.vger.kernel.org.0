Ok, I'll come back to that at the bottom :)

I'm not sure that anyone has current BE machines to test on....

Sure, I understand that we only need to log a 64bit value, but we
don't actually need a structure for that as the log is in native
endian format. Hence it can just be a 64 bit field that we mask and
shift for !bigtime inodes...

Note that we have to be real careful about dynamic conversion,
especially in recovery, as the inode read from disk might be in
small time format, but logged and recovered in bigtime format. I
didn't actually check the recovery code does that correctly, because
it only just occurred to me that the logged timestamp format may not
match the inode flags read from disk during recovery...

Sounds like a reasonable place to me.

*nod*. Good idea - we will have logged the inode core and converted
it in-core to bigtime by this point...

Let's drop the "ino" from the name - it's unnecessary, I think.

Hmmm. Definitely better, but how about:

/*
 * Bigtime epoch is set exactly to the minimum time value that a
 * traditional 32 bit timestamp can represent when using the Unix
 * epoch as a reference. Hence the Unix epoch is at a fixed offset
 * into the supported bigtime timestamp range.
 *
 * The bigtime epoch also matches the minimum value an on-disk 32
 * bit XFS timestamp can represent so we will not lose any fidelity
 * in converting to/from unix and bigtime timestamps.
 */
#define XFS_BIGTIME_EPOCH_OFFSET	(XFS_INO_TIME_MIN)

And then two static inline helpers follow immediately -
xfs_bigtime_to_unix() and xfs_bigtime_from_unix() can do the
conversion between the two formats and the XFS_BIGTIME_EPOCH_OFFSET
variable never gets seen anywhere else in the code. To set the max
timestamp value the superblock holds for the filesystem, just
calculate it directly via a call to xfs_bigtime_to_unix(-1ULL, ...)

Yup, I got an off by one thanks to integer rounding on the
division. I should have just done it long hand like that...

Cheers,

Dave.
