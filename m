How is the COW writeback completion modifying the extent list while
an extent shift is modifying the extent list?  Both should be
running under XFS_ILOCK_EXCL contexts so there shouldn't be a race
condition here unless we've screwed up the extent list modification
atomicity...

Oh... shifting extents is not an atomic operation w.r.t. other
inode modifications - both insert and collapse run individual
modification transactions and lock/unlock the inode around each
transaction. So, essentially, they aren't atomic when faced with
other *metadata* modifications to the inode.

Yup, that's exactly the landmine that non-atomic, multi-transaction
extent range operations have. It might be a COW operation, it might
be something else that ends up manipulating the extent list. But
because the ILOCK is not held across the entire extent shift,
insert/collapse are susceptible to corruption when any other XFs
code concurrently modifies the extent list.

I think insert/collapse need to be converted to work like a
truncate operation instead of a series on individual write
operations. That is, they are a permanent transaction that locks the
inode once and is rolled repeatedly until the entire extent listi
modification is done and then the inode is unlocked.

It looks ok to avoid this particular symptom (backportable point
fix), but I really think we should convert insert/collapse to be
atomic w.r.t other extent list modifications....

Cheers,

Dave.
