Yeah, that's messy, but I see a potential problem here with space
monitoring apps that poll the filesystem frequently to check space
usage. That's going to override whatever your background "do work"
setting is going to be...

So the main problem is block accounting. Non-reflink stuff is easy
(the equivalent of delalloc accounting) but reflink is hard.

I'd prefer something that doesn't require a magic heuristic. I don't
have any better ideas right now, so let's just go with what you have
and see what falls out...

Ugh, 2 * HZ != 2Hz. Stupid bad generic timer code, always trips me
over.

Right, I was thinking more along the lines of "run inactivation
twice for every background inode reclaim pass". It's clear that what
you were struggling with was that the interaction between the two
running at similar periods is not good, and hence no matter what the
background reclaim period is, we should process inactivated inodes a
at least a couple of times per reclaim period...

Right, it ends up about 2x per reclaim period by default. :)

Which is about 20s period. yeah, that's way too long...

Yeah, the main benefit is moving it into the background so that the
syscall completion isn't running the entire inode inactivation pass.
That moves almost 50% of the unlink processing off to another thread
which is what we want for rm -rf workloads. Keeping the batch size
small is probably the best place to start with this - just enough
inodes to keep a CPU busy for a scheduler tick?

Oh, cscope fail:

  File             Function                  Line
0 xfs/xfs_icache.c xfs_iget_check_free_state 297 xfs_iget_check_free_state(
1 xfs/xfs_icache.c __releases                378 error = xfs_iget_check_free_state(ip, flags);
2 xfs/xfs_icache.c xfs_iget_cache_miss       530 error = xfs_iget_check_free_state(ip, flags);

"__releases" is a sparse annotation, so it didn't trigger that this
was actually in xfs_iget_cache_hit()...

Never mind...

Sure, but the reclaim code was always a special "unreferenced"
lookup that just used the same code structure. It never mixed
"igrab()" with unreferenced inode pinning...

What's the problem with doing that to a dedicated worker thread?  We
currently stall inactivation on a frozen filesystem if a transaction
is required

I think stopping background inactivation for frozen filesystems make
more sense than this...

That's overkill.  Global synchronisation doesn't need complex
structures, just a low cost reader path.

All we need is an atomic bit that we can test via test_bit().
test_bit() is not a locked operation, but it is atomic. Hence most
of the time it is a shared cacheline and hence has near zero cost to
check as it can be shared across all CPUs.

Set the flag to turn off background inactivation, then all future
inactivations will be foreground. Then flush and stop the inodegc
work queue.  When we finish processing the last inactivated inode,
the background work stops (i.e. it is not requeued).  No more
pending background work.

Clear the flag to turn background inactivation back on. The first
inode queued will restart that background work...

Yes we do - that's what xfs_blockgc_stop() higher up in this
function does. xfs_log_clean() further down in the function also
stops the background log work (that covers the log when idle)
because xfs_remount_ro() leaves the log clean.

THese all get restarted in xfs_remount_rw()....

How do you unlink the file on a RO mount?

And if it's a rw mount that is frozen, it will block on the first
transaction in the inactivation process from close(), and block
there until the filesystem is unfrozen.

It's pretty clear to me that we want frozen filesystems to
turn off background inactivation so that we can block things like
this in the syscall context and not have to deal with the complexity
of freeze or read-only mounts in the background inactivation code at
all..

Cheers,

Dave.
