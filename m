It can still be useful for certain g*dawful scenarios --

Let's say you have a horribly misconfigured cloudy system with a tiny
log, hundreds of CPUs, a memory hogging process, another process with
many hundreds of threads that are performing small appending synchronous
writes to a large number of files, and some other process repeatedly
opens and closes files.  Background writeback completion will create
enough workers to tie up the log such that writeback and inodegc contend
for log grant space and make slow progress.  If memory is also tight,
we want to slow down the file scanning process so that it doesn't shove
/more/ inodes into the cache and push the system towards OOM behavior.

Back in the old days when inodegc was a radix tree tag it was fairly
easy to get OOMs when the delay interval was long (5 seconds).  The
OOM probability went down pretty sharply as the interval approached
zero, but even at 1 jiffy I could still occasionally trip it, whereas
the pre-deferred-inactivation kernels would never OOM.

I haven't tested it all that rigorously with Dave's fancy new per-cpu
list design, but I did throw on my silly test setup (see below) and
still got it to OOM once in 3 runs with the shrinker bits turned off.

<nod> That comment /does/ need to be updated to note the subtlety that a
lot of shrinker activity can slow down close()ing a file by making user
tasks wait for the inodegc workers to clear the backlog.

Yeah.  I snapshot /home (which has ~20 million inodes) then race
fsstress and xfs_scrub -n in a VM with 560MB of RAM.
