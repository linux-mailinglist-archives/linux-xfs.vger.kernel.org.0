Hmmmm. Why are you only testing v4 filesystems? They are deprecated
and support is largely due to be dropped from upstream in 2025...

Does the same problem occur with a v5 filesystems?

That's not what I'm asking. You've dumped the values at the time of
the hang, not traced the runtime reservations that have been made.

I don't want to see the log. It'll be huge - I regularly generate
traces containing gigabytes of log accounting traces like this from
a single workload.

What I'm asking you to do is run the tracing and then post process
the values from the trace to determine what operation is using more
space than is being freed back to the log.

I generally do this with grep, awk and sed. some people use python
or perl. But either way it's a *lot* of work - in the past I have
spent _weeks_ on trace analysis to find a 4 byte leak in the log
space accounting. DOing things like graphing the head, tail and grant
spaces over time tend to show if this is a gradual leak versus a
sudden step change. If it's a sudden step change, then you can
isolate it in the trace and work out what happened. If it's a
gradual change, then you need to start looking for accounting
discrepancies...

e.g. a transaction records 32 bytes used in the item, so it releases
t_unit - 32 bytes at commit. However, the CIL may then only track 28
bytes of space for the item in the journal and we leak 4 bytes of
reservation on every on of those items committed.

These sorts of leaks typically only add up to being somethign
significant in situations where the log is flooded with tiny inode
timestamp changes - 4 bytes iper item doesn't really matter when you
only have a few thousand items in the log, but when you have
hundreds of thousands of tiny items in the log...

Cheers,

Dave.
