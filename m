Though looking at buftarg allocation and my old notes from a couple of
years ago -- a second reason for allocating the buftarg during scrub
setup was that the list_lru_init call allocates an array that's
O(nodes_nr) and percpu_counter_init allocates an array that's
O(maxcpus).  At the time I decided that it was better to put those large
contiguous memory allocations in the ->setup routine where we don't have
any vfs/xfs locks held, can run direct reclaim, and haven't done any xfs
work yet.

So I'd like to leave the buftarg attached to struct xfs_scrub, though
I'll still get rid of the shrinker for xfile buftargs.
