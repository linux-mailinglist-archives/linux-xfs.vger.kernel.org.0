Additionally, when populating the filesystem in a regular file, to mount it
we need loop devices and we need to be root. Both of which we want to
avoid. So having an option to do this without mounting the filesystem like
ext4 and btrfs have would be very useful. It doesn't have to be via '-p', I'm
fine with a -d or --rootdir option like the ones that ext4 and btrfs
have as well.

Cheers,

Daan
