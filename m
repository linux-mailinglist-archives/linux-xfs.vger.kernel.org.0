Somewhat unfortunate that we have to iterate all AGs for each chain. I'm
wondering if that has any effect on a large recovery on fs' with an
inordinate AG count. Have you tested under those particular conditions?
I suppose it's possible the recovery is slow enough that this won't
matter...

Also, perhaps not caused by this patch but does this
outsized/manufactured reservation have the effect of artificially
steering allocations to a particular AG if one happens to be notably
larger than the rest?
