Hi all,

Test group files (e.g. tests/generic/group) are a pain to keep up.
Every week I rebase on Eryu's latest upstream, and every week I have to
slog through dozens of trivial merge conflicts because of the
groupfiles.  Moving tests is annoying because we have to maintain all
this code to move the group associations from one /group file to
another.

It doesn't need to be this way -- we could move each test's group
information into the test itself, and automatically generate the group
files as part of the make process.  This series does exactly that.

The first few patches add some convenient anchors for the new
per-testfile group tagging and a conversion script to migrate existing
test files.  Next there's a huge patch that is the results of running
the conversion script, followed by cleanup of the golden outputs.  After
that comes the build infrastructure to generate group files and other
tweaks to the existing maintainer scripts to use the new infrastructure.
Finally, remove the group files themselves and the (now unnecessary)
code that maintained them.

v1: promote from rfc, use group.list for autogenerated group files, fix
    odd build warts, rename preamble function, update readme
v2: add reviews, remove _cleanup functions that mirror the standard one,
    use rm -rf to clean $tmp.*
v3: fix a few documentation nits, rearrange some of the cleanups, tidy
    some unused variables

If you're going to start using this mess, you probably ought to just
pull from my git trees, which are linked below.

This is an extraordinary way to destroy everything.  Enjoy!
Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
