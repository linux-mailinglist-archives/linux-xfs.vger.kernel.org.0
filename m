Sorry for digging this really old post [1]. The overall background is
that, @offset and @len need to be aligned with cluster size when doing
fallocate(), or several xfstests cases calling fsx will fail if the
tested filesystem enabling 'bigalloc' feature.

In fact only for insert_range and collapse range of ext4 and xfs (in
realtime mode), @offset and @len need to be aligned with cluster size.

Though fat and ocfs2 also support cluster size, ocfs2 only supports
preallocate and punch_hole, and fat only supports preallocate, in which
case @offset and @len needn't be aligned with cluster size.


So we need to align @offset and @len with cluster size only for ext4 and
xfs (in realtime mode) at a minimum cost, to fix this issue. But the
question is, there's no standard programming interface exporting cluster
size. For both ext4 and xfs, it's stored as a binary data in disk
version superblock, e.g., tune2fs could detect the cluster size of ext4.


Any idea on how to query the cluster size?
