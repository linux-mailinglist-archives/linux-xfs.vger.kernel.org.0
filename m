From: Darrick J. Wong <darrick.wong@oracle.com>

Separate the computation of the log push threshold and the push logic in
xlog_grant_push_ail.  This enables higher level code to determine (for
example) that it is holding on to a logged intent item and the log is so
busy that it is more than 75% full.  In that case, it would be desirable
to move the log item towards the head to release the tail, which we will
cover in the next patch.
