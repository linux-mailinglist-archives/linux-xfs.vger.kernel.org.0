Yes, but the goal of this patch is not to completely fix the dmlogwrites
infrastructure and set of tests. The goal is to disable a subset of
tests that are known to produce spurious corruptions on XFS until that
issue can be addressed, so it doesn't result in continued bug reports in
the meantime. I don't run these tests routinely on other fs', so it's
not really my place to decide that the tradeoff between this problem and
the ability of the test to reproduce legitimate bugs justifies disabling
the test on those configs.
