Ok, I'll see what I can do with that.

Right.

It looked like generic/361 used only the SCRATCH_DEV so I thought
that meant making a file system and mounting it within the test.

My VM disks are VirtIO (file based) virtual disks, so that sounds
a bit different.

Unfortunately I can't use raw disks on the NAS I use for VMs and
I've migrated away from having a desktop machine with a couple of
disks to help with testing.

I have other options if I really need to but it's a little bit
harder to setup and use company lab machines remotely, compared to
local hardware (requesting additional disks is hard to do), and
I'm not sure (probably not) if they can/will use raw disks (or
partitions) either.

I will, yes.

I neglected to mention that my series is now based on the for-next
branch as I noticed the get_tree_bdev() fix is present so I can drop
the first patch.

It seemed to me that the for-next branch is the right place to base
the series. I expect there will be the odd bump in the road of course
