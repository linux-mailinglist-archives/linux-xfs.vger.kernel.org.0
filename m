Which then makes it specific to test running, and that makes it
less suited to use from check-parallel (or any other generic test
context).

check-parallel already does this, and it leaves them around after
the test, so....

4. use check-parallel.

How many people actually use /tmp for fstests mount points?

IMO, it's better for ongoing maintenance to drop support for /tmp
based mount points (less complexity in infrastructure setup). If
there are relatively few ppl who do this, perhaps it would be best
to treat this setup the same as the setsid encapsulation. i.e. works
for now, but is deprecated and is going to be removed in a years
time....

Then we can simply add a /tmp test to the HAVE_PRIVATENS setting and
avoid using a private ns for these setups for now. This gives
everyone who does use these setups time to migrate to a different
setup that will work with private namespaces correctly, whilst
keeping the long term maintenance burden of running tests in private
namespaces down to a minimum.
