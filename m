Ok let's see.

Greg,

In kernels < 6.10 the size of the 'dqs' array per transaction was too small
(XFS_QM_TRANS_MAXDQS is 2 instead of 3) which can, as explained
in my commit, cause an assertion and crash the kernel.

This bug exists for a long time, it may have low probability for the entire
"world", but under specific conditions (e.g. a specific workload that is fu=
lly
controlled by unpriv user) it happens for us every other week on kernel 5.1=
5.y
and with more effort, an upriv user can trigger it much more frequently.

In kernel 6.10, XFS_QM_TRANS_MAXDQS was increased to 5 to
cover a use case for a new feature (parent pointer).
That means that upstream no longer has the bug.

I opted for applying this upstream commit to fix the stable kernel bug
although raising the max to 5 is an overkill.

This has a slight impact on memory footprint, but I think it is negligible
and in any case, same exact memory footprint as upstream code.

What do you prefer? Applying the commit as is with increase to 5
or apply a customized commit for kernels < 6.10 which raises the
max to 3 without mentioning the upstream commit?

If you agree with my choice, please advise regarding my choice of
formatting of the commit message - original commit message followed
by stable specific bug fix commit message which explains the above.

Yeh, I do not like waste, but do not like to over complicate and micro
optimize either.

Talking about waste, in current upstream xfs_dquot_acct is bloated
as you described for the majority of users that enable quotas, who
do not enable parent pointers.

So if we consider this memory waste to be a bug, I prefer that stable
and upstream will be bug compatible.

If we fix that waste in upstream, we could add:
Fixes: f103df763563a ("xfs: Increase XFS_QM_TRANS_MAXDQS to 5")

Which would then be flagged for picking to stable kernels
that have this commit applied.

So? WDYT?

Thanks,
Amir.
