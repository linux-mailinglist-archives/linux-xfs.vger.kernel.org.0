In patch one we send I_DIRTY_SYNC as we had been doing as before.  So
I don't believe that patch #1 would regress XFS; can you confirm?

My thinking was to move ahead with patch 1 so that it fixed the bug
which Eric Biffers had reported for f2fs, but only to move forward
with patch #2 if it would be useful for XFS.
