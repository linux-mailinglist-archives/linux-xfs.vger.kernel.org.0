I don't agree with this decision because the comment for
xfs_inodegc_stop now says that callers must hold s_umount.
xchk_stop_reaping definitely does /not/ hold that lock, which means it's
now buggy.  Someone downstream could be using scrub, even if it's still
experimental.

I've generally said not to bother with scrub fixes, but I don't think
it's correct to introduce a bug in an LTS kernel.  Please backport
2d5f38a31980 since all it does is removes the offending call and turns
off code in fscounters.c.
