Hi,

As some of you may know, Leah has been out on medical leave for a
while.  I had hoped that she would be back in mid-July, but it looks
like it's going to be a bit longer.

As a result, I've taken it on myself to try to look at the more
obvious backlog of patches that need to be backported to 5.15.  I've
come up with this list (see below), and I've been giving this patch
series extensive testing to make sure none of these would cause
regressions.  Most of these fix bugs where the fact that a commit
needs to be backported is noted in an xfstests test, and indeed,
backporting the commit address the test failure.  Hence, xfs in 5.15
passes xfstests significantly cleaner as a result.

I did note that there is one commit in the 6.1 LTS, "xfs: disable
reaping in fscounters scrub" (2d5f38a31980 in upstream) that was not
in the 5.15 LTS, but when I tried backporting this commit to 5.15, it
resulted in a number of xfstests regressions, so I've dropped this
commit from my proposed backports list for now.  I assume some one or
more additional patches would need to be backported to 5.15 LTS.  A
problem for later.

I'm continuing to run some additional tests, but so far, things look
solid.  So I'm sending this to the linux-xfs list now so (a) XFS
developers can take a look at the commits and the patches, and see if
they look sane, and (b) to ask what the process should be in terms
sending these commits to Greg in Leah's absence.  Leah has
significantly more xfs experience than I do, so I won't be offended if
more review is desired before giving these patches an LGTM.  In fact,
I'd kind of appreciate it.  :-)

Also, I can also e-mail these patches to linux-xfs, but I didn't know
if this would be desired before I potentially spammed the linux-xfs
list.

Anyway, here is the summary of the proposed backports to 5.15.  Please
take a look.

Thanks,

					- Ted

(Commit id's are in the xfs-5.15 branch in my xfs-lts-backports git
tree[1].  Commits that have the note "not yet in 6.1" branch has been
backported to the proposed xfs-6.1 branch, although please note that
the xfs-6.1 branch hasn't yet gotten as much testing as the xfs-5.15
branch.)
