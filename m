Please come back, because I think it's also clear that the "we don't
support changes of ops vectors at runtime" assertion is already being
violated by ext4 [1]. So that leaves "IFF we ever want to change the
dax vs non-dax mode" which I thought was already consensus given the
lingering hopes about having some future where the kernel is able to
dynamically optimize for dax vs non-dax based on memory media
performance characteristics. I thought the only thing missing from the
conclusion of the last conversation [2] was the "physical" vs
"effective" split that we identified at LSF'19 [3]. Christoph, that
split allows for for your concern about application intent to be
considered / overridden by kernel policy, and it allows for
communication of the effective state which applications need for
resource planning [4] independent of MAP_SYNC and other dax semantics.

The status quo of globally enabling dax for all files is empirically
the wrong choice for page-cache friendly workloads running on
slower-than-DRAM pmem media.

I am struggling to see how we address the above items without first
having a dynamic / less than global-filesystem scope facility to
control dax.
