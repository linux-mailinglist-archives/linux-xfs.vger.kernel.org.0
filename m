Right, the point of check-parallel is to take away the need to
specify devices completely.  I've already added support for the
LOGWRITES_DEV, and I'm in the process of adding LOGDEV and RTDEV
support for both test and scratch devices. At this point, the need
for actual actual device specification in the config files goes
away.

What I am expecting to need is a set of fields that specify the
*size* of the devices so that the hard-coded image file sizes in
the check-parallel script go away.

From there, I intend to have check-parallel iterate config file run
sections itself, rather than have it run them internally to check.
That way check is only ever invoked by check-parallel with all the
devices completely set up.

Hence a typical host independent config file would look like:

TEST_DEV_SIZE=10g
TEST_RTDEV_size=10g
TEST_LOGDEV_SIZE=128m
SCRATCH_DEV_SIZE=20g
SCRATCH_RTDEV_size=20g
SCRATCH_LOGDEV_SIZE=512m
LOGWRITES_DEV_SIZE=2g

[xfs]
FSTYP=xfs
MKFS_OPTIONS="-b size=4k"
TEST_FS_MOUNT_OPTIONS=
MOUNT_OPTIONS=
USE_EXTERNAL=

[xfs-rmapbt]
MKFS_OPTIONS="-b size=4k -m rmapbt=1"

[xfs-noreflink]
MKFS_OPTIONS="-b size=4k -m reflink=0"

[xfs-n64k]
MKFS_OPTIONS="-b size=4k -n size=64k"

[xfs-ext]
MKFS_OPTIONS="-b size=4k"
USE_EXTERNAL=yes

[ext4]
FSTYP="ext4"
MKFS_OPTIONS=
USE_EXTERNAL=

[btrfs]
FSTYP="btrfs"
.....


IOWs, all that is different from system to system is the device size
setup. The actual config sections under test (e.g. [xfs]) never need
to change from host to host, nor environment to environment. i.e.
"xfs-n64k" runs the same config filesystem test on every system,
everywhere...

I'm not going to be at LSFMM, so please discuss this on the list via
email as we'd normally do so. LSFMM discussions are exclusionary
whilst, OTOH, the mailing list is inclusive...

I don't really see a need for a new centralised config setup. With
the above, we can acheived a "zero-config" goal with the existing
config file formats and infrastructure. All that we need to do is
update the default config file in the repo to contain a section for
each of the "standard" test configs we want to define....

On of my goals with check-parallel is to completely remove the need
for end users to configure fstests. i.e. all you need to do is point
it at a directory, tell it which filesystem to test, and it "just
runs" with all the defaults that come direct from the fstests
repository...

It is also worth keeping in mind that check-parallel can be run with
a single runner thread, in which case a single check instance runs
all tests serially. i.e. we can make check-parallel emulate existing
check behaviour exactly, except it uses all the
auto-config/auto-setup stuff that comes along with check-parallel...

-Dave.
