I don't see why this ends up being a problem - xfs_attr_set() is
only called by code in fs/xfs/*.c, so adding a wrapper function
that just does this:

int
xfs_attr_change(
	struct xfs_da_args      *args)
{
	struct xfs_mount	*mp = args->dp->i_mount;

	if (xfs_has_larp(mp)) {
		error = xfs_attr_use_log_assist(mp);
		if (error)
			return error;
	}

	error = xfs_attr_set(args);
	if (xfs_has_larp(mp))
		xlog_drop_incompat_feat(mp->m_log);
	return error;
}

into one of the files in fs/xfs will get this out of libxfs, won't
it?

What am I missing here?

Cheers,

Dave.
