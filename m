<nod> I think you're saying that _xfs_trans_bjoin should:

	if (!(bip->bli_flags & XFS_BLI_HOLD))
		atomic_inc(&bip->bli_refcount);

and xfs_buf_item_release should do:

	if (hold)
		return;
	released = xfs_buf_item_put(bip);
	if (stale && !released)
		return;

I'll have to remember how I induced this error in the first place.  I
think it was when I was running repair tests with mem=600M.
