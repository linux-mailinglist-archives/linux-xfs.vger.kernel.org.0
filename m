Yeah, I think we should require that callers drop all such locks before
invoking a sync scan, since that may livelock against the lock held by
the current task (or cause similar weirdness against concurrent sync
scans, as the code prior to the commit below[1] had demonstrated).  The
async scans used throughout this series seem reasonable to me..
