More than likely.

Ok, I'm assuming you are using fsmark with -k to keep files around,
and -S0 to leave cleaning to the background flush, a number of files per
iteration to get regular reporting and a total number of iterations to
fill memory to hit what you're seeing. I've created a configuration that
should do this but it'll take a long time to run on a local test machine.

I'm not 100% certain I guessed right as to get fsmark reports while memory
fills, it would have to be fewer files so each iteration would have to
preserve files. If the number of files per iteration is large enough to
fill memory then the drop in files/sec is not visible from the fs_mark
output (or we are using different versions). I guess you could just be
calculating average files/sec over the entire run based on elapsed time.

As observed by iostat -x or something else? Sum of r/s and w/s would
approximate iops but not the breakdown of whether it is data, journal
or metadata writes. The rest can be inferred from a blktrace but I would
prefer to replicate your setup as close as possible. If you're not using
fs_mark to report Files/sec, are you simply monitoring df -i over time?

All understood.

The boosting was not intended to target THP specifically -- it was meant
to help recover early from any fragmentation-related event for any user
that might need it. Hence, it's not tied to THP but even with THP
disabled, the boosting will still take effect.

One band-aid would be to disable watermark boosting entirely when THP is
disabled but that feels wrong. However, I would be interested in hearing
if sysctl vm.watermark_boost_factor=0 has the same effect as your patch.

The intention behind avoiding slab reclaim from kswapd context is that the
boost is due to a fragmentation-causing event. Compaction cannot move slab
pages so reclaiming them in response to fragmentation does not directly
help. However, it can indirectly help by avoiding fragmentation-causing
events due to slab allocation like inodes and also mean that reclaim
behaviour is not special cased.

On that basis, it may justify ripping out the may_shrinkslab logic
everywhere. The downside is that some microbenchmarks will notice.
Specifically IO benchmarks that fill memory and reread (particularly
rereading the metadata via any inode operation) may show reduced
results. Such benchmarks can be strongly affected by whether the inode
information is still memory resident and watermark boosting reduces
the changes the data is still resident in memory. Technically still a
regression but a tunable one.

Hence the following "it builds" patch that has zero supporting data on
whether it's a good idea or not.
