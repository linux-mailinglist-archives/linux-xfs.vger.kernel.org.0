When buffers get flushed and then pinned and can't be written back,
we issue sync log forces from the AIL because the delwri list is not
empty and the force count is non-zero.

So it's not just pinned items in the AIL that trigger this - it's
stuff that gets pinned after it has been flushed but before it gets
written that causes problems, too.

And if it's pinned buffers in the delwri list that are the issue,
then we stop flushing other items from the list while we wait for
the log force. hence if the tail pinning items are not actually
pinned, but other buffers are, then we block on the log force when
we could have been flushing and writing the items that pin the tail
of the log.

Yup, largely because there are multiple triggers for log forces. 
There's a difference between buffers that can't be flushed because
they are pinned and flushed buffers that can't be written because
they are pinned. The prior prevents the AIL from making push progress,
the latter doesn't.

Yes.

I'm not touching the rest of the log force code in this series - it
is out of scope of this bug fix and the rest of the series that it
is part of.

Cleaning up the mess that is the xfs_log_* and xlog_* interfaces and
changing things like log force behaviour and implementation is for
a future series.

Cheers,

Dave.
