Yeah, xfs_difree_inode_chunk() calls xfs_bmap_add_free() which goes
through the deferops to free the inode chunk extent(s).

I suspect that we can also get xfs_alloc_fix_freelist() deferring
AGFL frees here too. I basically just assume anything that allocates
or frees extents is likely to have at least one deferop as a result
of this....

*nod*

That was my thinking about the problem, too.
