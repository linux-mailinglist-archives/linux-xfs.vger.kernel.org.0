Hi Brain,

I've held off commenting immediately on this while I tried to get
the concept of dynamic relogging straight in my head. I couldn't put
my finger on what I thought was wrong - just a nagging feeling that
I'd gone down this path before and it ended in somethign that didn't
work.

It wasn't until a couple of hours ago that a big cogs clunked into
place and I realised this roughly mirrored a path I went down 12 or
13 years ago trying to implement what turned into the CIL. I failed
at least 4 times over 5 years trying to implement delayed logging...

THere's a couple of simple code comments below before what was in my
head seemed to gel together into something slightly more coherent
than "it seems inside out"....

Hmmmm. So we are putting the AIL lock directly into the transaction
reserve path? xfs_trans_reserve() goes out of it's way to be
lockless in the fast paths, so if you want this to be a generic
mechanism that any transaction can use, the reservation needs to be
completely lockless.

seems like a case of "only set the flags once you have a reference"?
Then xfs_trans_cancel() can clean up without special cases being
needed anywhere...

That looks ... interesting. xfs_trans_ail_relog_put() can call
xfs_log_done(), which means it can do a log write, which means the
commit lsn for this transaction could change. Hence to make a relog
permanent as a result of a sync transaction, we'd need the
commit_lsn of the AIL relog ticket write here, not that of the
original transaction that was written.

This has the potential for log writes to be issued from a
transaction abort context, right?

And log writes from a cancel seems possible here, too. I don't think
we do this at all right now, so this could have some interesting
unexpected side-effects during error handling. (As if that wasn't
complex enough to begin with!)

Hmmm.

So before we've even returned from xfs_trans_alloc(), we may have
committed the transaction and burnt and entire transaction entire
log space reservations?

IOWs, to support relogging of a single item in a permanent
transaction, we have to increase the log count of the transaction so
that we don't end up running out of reservation space one
transaction before the end of the normal fast path behaviour of the
change being made?

And we do that up front because we're not exactly sure of how much
space the item that needs relogging is going to require, but the AIL
is going to need to hold on to it from as long as it needs to relog
the item.

<GRRRRIIINNNNDDDD>

<CLUNK>

Ahhhhh.

This is the reason why the CIL ended up using a reservation stealing
mechanism for it's ticket. Every log reservation takes into account
the worst case log overhead for that single transaction - that means
there are no special up front hooks or changes to the log
reservation to support the CIL, and it also means that the CIL can
steal what it needs from the current ticket at commit time. Then the
CIL can commit at any time, knowing it has enough space to write all
the items it tracks to the log.

This avoided the transaction reservation mechanism from needing to
know anything about the CIL or that it was stealing space from
committing transactions for it's own private ticket. It greatly
simplified everything, and it's the reason that the CIL succeeded
where several other attempts to relog items in memory failed....

So....

Why can't the AIL steal the reservation it needs from the current
transaction when the item that needs relogging is being committed?
i.e. we add the "relog overhead" to the permanent transaction that
requires items to be relogged by the AIL, and when that item is
formatted into the CIL we also check to see if it is currently
marked as "reloggable". If it's not, we steal the relogging
reservation from the transaction (essentially the item's formatted
size) and pass it to the AIL's private relog ticket, setting the log
item to be "reloggable" so the reservation isn't stolen over and
over again as the object is relogged in the CIL.

Hence as we commit reloggable items to the CIL, the AIL ticket
reservation grows with each of those items marked as reloggable.
As we relog items to the CIL and the CIL grows it's reservation via
the size delta, the AIL reservation can also be updated with the
same delta.

Hence the AIL will always know exactly how much space it needs to relog all
the items it holds for relogging, and because it's been stolen from
the original transaction it is, like the CIL tciket reservation,
considered used space in the log. Hence the log space required for
relogging items via the AIL is correctly accounted for without
needing up front static, per-item reservations.

When the item is logged the final time and the reloggable flag is
removed (e.g. when the quotaoff completes) then we can remove the
reservation from AIL ticket and add it back to the current
transaction. Hence when the final transaction is committed and the
ticket for that transaction is released via xfs_log_done(), the
space the AIL held for relogging the item is also released.

This doesn't require any modifications to the transaction
reservation subsystem, nor the itransaction commit/cancel code,
no changes to the log space accounting, etc. All we need to do is
tag items when we log them as reloggable, and in the CIL formatting
of the item pass the formatted size differences to the AIL so it can
steal the reservation it needs.

Then the AIL doesn't need a dynamic relogging ticket. It can just
hold a single ticket from init to teardown by taking an extra
reference to the ticket. When it is running a relog, it can build it
as though it's just a normal permanent transaction without needing
to get a new reservation, and when it rolls the write space consumed
is regranted automatically.

AFAICT, that gets rid of the need for all this ticket reference counting,
null pointer checking, lock juggling and rechecking, etc. It does
not require modification to the transaction reservation path, and we
can account for the relogging on an item by item basis in each
individual transaction reservation....

Thoughts?

-Dave.
