Not to mention cases when reviews come 'too late'. A V2 is submitted right
before a new comment on V1, and that creates a V3,4,5....

Despite the fact I particularly don't like the term 'sprint' :) I believe
gathering together from time to time to discuss next steps, is much appreciated.
My experience with the past few years is mostly what you described, everything
is scattered and it's hard to know what to prioritize. At a first I was mostly
thinking it was due my TZ constrains, which usually brings me 'late to the
party' (if I arrive at all :). But with your email, it seems there are more
things in play.
Lately I've been trying to help mostly on reviews, but again, it's usually hard
to know what to review first, so, most of time I feel like randomly picking
stuff on the list to review, unless somebody asks for help reviewing something
specific. So, from a reviewing PoV, this can help a lot what should be reviewed
first.
Also, probably now mostly regarding my TZ, I'm usually oblivious regarding
what's happening, so, I sometimes have a hard time to figure out where I can
give a hand when I have some spare time, maybe these 'meetings' (or whatever
we'll call it) will also help in this case.

Regarding on 'where', may I suggest a single email thread per -rc (or week,
month, whatever)? I'm just being selfish here though, so I don't need to be
on irc late night or early morning :) But if email doesn't work, I'll do what I
can to attend the meetings.

Cheers.
