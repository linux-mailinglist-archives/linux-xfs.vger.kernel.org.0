I think this is a predicate, right?  Should this function return a bool
instead of an int?

This function always confuses me slightly since it pushes us through the
covering state machine, and (I think) assumes that someone will force
the CIL and push the AIL if it returns zero. :)

To check my thinking further-- back in that thread I started about
setting and clearing log incompat flags, I think Dave was pushing me to
clear the log incompat flags just before we call xfs_sync_sb when the
log is in NEED2 state, right?

AFAICT the net effect of this series is to reorder the log code so that
xfs_log_quiesce covers the log (force cil, push ail, log two
transactions containing only the superblock), and adds an xfs_log_clean
that quiesces the log and then writes an unmount record after that.

Two callers whose behavior does not change with this series are: 1) The
log worker quiesces the log when it's idle; and 2) unmount quiesces the
log and then writes an unmount record so that the next mount knows it
can skip replay entirely.

The big difference is 3) freeze now only covers the log, whereas before
it would cover, write an unmount record, and immediately redirty the log
to force replay of the snapshot, right?

Assuming I understood all that, my next question is: Eric Sandeen was
working on a patchset to process unlinked inodes unconditionally on
mount so that frozen fs images can be written out with the unmount
record (because I guess people make ro snapshots of live fs images and
then balk when they have to make the snapshot rw to run log recovery.
Any thoughts about /that/? :)
