From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

The current implementation of xlog_assign_tail_lsn() assumes that
when the AIL is empty, the log tail matches the LSN of the last
written commit record. This is recorded in xlog_state_set_callback()
as log->l_last_sync_lsn when the iclog state changes to
XLOG_STATE_CALLBACK. This change is then immediately followed by
running the callbacks on the iclog which then insert the log items
into the AIL at the "commit lsn" of that checkpoint.

The AIL tracks log items via the start record LSN of the checkpoint,
not the commit record LSN. THis is because we can pipeline multiple
checkpoints, and so the start record of checkpoint N+1 can be
written before the commit record of checkpoint N. i.e:

     start N			commit N
	+-------------+------------+----------------+
		  start N+1			commit N+1

The tail of the log cannot be moved to the LSN of commit N when all
the items of that checkpoint are written back, because then the
start record for N+1 is no longer in the active portion of the log
and recovery will fail/corrupt the filesystem.

Hence when all the log items in checkpoint N are written back, the
tail of the log most now only move as far forwards as the start LSN
of checkpoint N+1.

Hence we cannot use the maximum start record LSN the AIL sees as a
replacement the pointer to the current head of the on-disk log
records. However, we currently only use the l_last_sync_lsn when the
AIL is empty - when there is no start LSN remaining, the tail of the
log moves to the LSN of the last commit record as this is where
recovery needs to start searching for recoverable records. THe next
checkpoint will have a start record LSN that is higher than
l_last_sync_lsn, and so everything still works correctly when new
checkpoints are written to an otherwise empty log.

l_last_sync_lsn is an atomic variable because it is currently
updated when an iclog with callbacks attached moves to the CALLBACK
state. While we hold the icloglock at this point, we don't hold the
AIL lock. When we assign the log tail, we hold the AIL lock, not the
icloglock because we have to look up the AIL. Hence it is an atomic
variable so it's not bound to a specific lock context.

However, the iclog callbacks are only used for CIL checkpoints. We
don't use callbacks with unmount record writes, so the
l_last_sync_lsn variable only gets updated when we are processing
CIL checkpoint callbacks. And those callbacks run under AIL lock
contexts, not icloglock context. The CIL checkpoint already knows
what the LSN of the iclog the commit record was written to (obtained
when written into the iclog before submission) and so we can update
the l_last_sync_lsn under the AIL lock in this callback. No other
iclog callbacks will run until the currently executing one
completes, and hence we can update the l_last_sync_lsn under the AIL
lock safely.

This means l_last_sync_lsn can move to the AIL as the "ail_head_lsn"
and it can be used to replace the atomic l_last_sync_lsn in the
iclog code. This makes tracking the log tail belong entirely to the
AIL, rather than being smeared across log, iclog and AIL state and
locking.
