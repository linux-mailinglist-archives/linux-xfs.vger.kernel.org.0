FWIW if you /did/ accept this for 5.19, I would suggest adding:

printk_index_subsys_emit("XFS log messages shall not be considered a stable kernel ABI as they can change at any time");

I base that largely on the evidence -- there's nothing saying that
catalogued strings are or are not a stable ABI.  That means it's up to
the subsystem or the maintainers or whoever to make a decision, and I
would decide that while some people somewhere might benefit from having
the message catalogue over not having it (e.g. i18n), someone would have
to show a /very/ strong case for letting XFS get powertop'd.

Granted I won't be the maintainer after Sunday and this isn't 5.18
material, so I suppose the ball is in your court. ;)
