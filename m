Since xfs_trans_ail_delete_bulk no longer exists, revising the comment
for new function xfs_trans_ail_delete.

Fix following warning:
make W=1 fs/xfs/xfs_trans_ail.o
fs/xfs/xfs_trans_ail.c:793: warning: Function parameter or member 
'ailp' not described in 'xfs_trans_ail_delete'

'lip' not described in 'xfs_trans_ail_delete'
fs/xfs/xfs_trans_ail.c:793: warning: Function parameter or member
'shutdown_type' not described in 'xfs_trans_ail_delete'
