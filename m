We probably need a better elaboration of the exact usecases of atomic
writes since I haven't been to LSF in a couple of years (and probably
not this year either).  I can think of a couple of access modes off the
top of my head:

1) atomic directio write where either you stay under the hardware atomic
write limit and we use it, or...

2) software atomic writes where we use the xfs copy-on-write mechanism
to stage the new blocks and later map them back into the inode, where
"later" is either an explicit fsync or an O_SYNC write or something...

3) ...or a totally separate interface where userspace does something
along the lines of:

	write_fd = stage_writes(fd);

which creates an O_TMPFILE and reflinks all of fd's content to it

	write(write_fd...);

	err = commit_writes(write_fd, fd);

which then uses extent remapping to push all the changed blocks back to
the original file if it hasn't changed.  Bonus: other threads don't see
the new data until commit_writes() finishes, and we can introduce new
log items to make sure that once we start committing we can finish it
even if the system goes down.

Lack of developer time, AFAICT.
