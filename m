Well, it isn't just the radix tree tagging, but mostly the
infrastructure in iget that seems duplicates a lot of very delicate
code.

For the actual inactivation run:  why don't we queue up the inodes
for deactivation directly that, that use the work_struct in the
inode to directly queue up the inode to the workqueue and let the
workqueue manage the details?  That also means we can piggy back on
flush_work and flush_workqueue to force one or more entries out.

Again I'm not saying I know this is better, but this is something that
comes to my mind when reading the code.
