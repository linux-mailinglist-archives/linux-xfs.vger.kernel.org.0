Sure, that's what the hook in xfs_trans_alloc() would do. It can do
the work in the context that is going to need it, and set a wait
flag for all incoming transactions that need a log incompat flag to
wait for it do it's work.  Once it's done and the flag is set, it
can continue and wake all the waiters now that the log incompat flag
has been set. Anything that doesn't need a log incompat flag can
just keep going and doesn't ever get blocked....

I don't think the number of bits is ever going to be a worry.  If we
do it on a transaction granularlity, it will only block transactions
taht need the log incomapt bit, and only until the bit is set.

I suspect this is one of the rare occasions where an unlogged
modification makes an awful lot of sense: we don't even log that we
are adding a log incompat flag, we just do an atomic synchronous
write straight to the superblock to set the incompat flag(s). The
entire modification can be done under the superblock buffer lock to
serialise multiple transactions all trying to set incompat bits, and
we don't set the in-memory superblock incompat bit until after it
has been set and written to disk. Hence multiple waits can check the
flag after they've got the sb buffer lock, and they'll see that it's
already been set and just continue...

This gets rid of the whole "what about a log containing an item that
sets the incompat bit" problem, and it provides a simple means of
serialising and co-ordinating setting of a log incompat flag....

We don't want to set the incompat bits if we don't need to. That
just guarantees user horror stories that start with "boot system
with new kernel, crash, go back to old kernel, can't mount root
filesystem anymore".

Cheers,

Dave.
