Ah, so I just checked where the m4/package_urcu.m4 file went -
forgot to re-add it after it rejected on apply. The diff is this:

diff --git a/m4/package_urcu.m4 b/m4/package_urcu.m4
new file mode 100644
index 000000000000..9b0dee35d9a1

+       AC_MSG_RESULT(yes),
+       AC_MSG_RESULT(no))
+    AC_SUBST(liburcu)
+  ])

And this ends up with the output on a current debian system of:

checking urcu.h usability... yes
checking urcu.h presence... yes
checking for urcu.h... yes
checking for liburcu... yes

IOWs, the package check I was using directly probed for rcu_init()
being present in liburcu. Hence if liburcu is not providing this
function via the default linking like we use with xfsprogs, then
we fail at the configure step.

So it liburcu is not providing rcu_init(), then the configure step
should fail, and you need to work out what is different about the
liburcu that is installed on the distro you are building on....

urcu should fire an assert on any attempt to access urcu TLS storage
because the "urcu.registered" flag in the TLS area has not been
initialised.  IOWs, if we miss register/unregister then things will
go bad in urcu calls and it should be noticed.

Cheers,

Dave.
