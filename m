'mkfs.xfs -d rtinherit=1' works very well. Thanks a lot.

I noticed that 'reflink not supported with realtime devices' both in
mkfs.xfs and in kernel/xfs(c14632ddac98 xfs: don't allow reflink +
realtime filesystems).

Is this a limit of current design?
or we just disable reflink when realtime devices  just for QoS/realtime?
