Admittedly I did look at the:

	xlog_verify_dest_ptr(log, ptr);
	memcpy(ptr, reg->i_addr + reg_offset, rlen);
	xlog_write_adv_cnt(&ptr, len, log_offset, rlen);
	(*record_cnt)++;
	*data_cnt += rlen;

sprinkled in three places and wondered why that couldn't have been a
single function.  Eh, well.

Leaving the ophdr manipulations as separate clauses actually helps me to
figure out /why/ they're different.

For a short patchset I agree, but I don't think dumping the /next/ forty
patches on the list as an RFC is going to help much.  We're keyed to the
kernel release cycle, which means (to me anyway) that the criteria is a
little different for Gigantic Patchsets that are never going to land in
a single cycle.

Whereas for small patchsets I think it's reasonable to ask that all the
weird warts get fixed by the end of review, for bigger things I think
it's ok to lower that standard to "Can we understand it in case the
author disappears; and does it not introduce obvious regressions"?

I've applied the same principle to this really long story arc of adding
parent pointers to the filesystem -- yes, the delayed xattrs series has
some strange things in it structurally, but I was ok with only asking
for obvious cleanups (like fixing the naming inconsistencies) so that we
can get to the next series, which justifies all the slicing and dicing
by turning the xattr state machine into a deferred log item.

Posting the full set as a git branch somewhere so at least we can pull
it and see the even bigger picture might, though.  It's helped immensely
for reviewing the delayed xattrs series and throwing some early feedback
to Allison w.r.t. deferred xattrs.

All right, back to the latest posting.
