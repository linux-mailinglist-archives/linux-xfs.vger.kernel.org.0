I'm confused at what this is attempting to accomplish. If we have a
single CIL force and that happens to span several iclogs, isn't the goal
to wait on the previous iclog to ensure the previously written content
of the current checkpoint is on-disk? If so, it looks to me that
commit_iclog will always match log->l_iclog in that scenario because in
the commit record path we don't (potentially) switch it out until toward
the end of this function. Hmm.. did you mean to check ->ic_prev against
->l_iclog perhaps, or am I just missing something else?
