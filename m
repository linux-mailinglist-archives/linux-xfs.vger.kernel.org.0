And as I asked three weeks ago, what's the harm in checking for a NULL
pointer here?  The kerneldoc for shmem_file_setup doesn't explicitly
exclude a null return.  True, it doesn't mention the possibility of
ERR_PTR returns either, but that's an accepted practice for pointer
returns.

For a call outside of the xfs subsystem, I think it's prudent to have
stronger return value checking.  Yes, someone changing the interface
would have to add a null check to all the callsites, but (a) it's benign
to guard against a behavior change in another module and (b) people miss
things all the time.

Huh?

Are you talking about this stupid behavior of bots where they decide
what a function returns based on the callsites in lieu of analyzing the
actual implementation code?

I don't feel like getting harassed by bots when someone /does/
accidentally change the implementation to return NULL, and now one of
the other build/test/syz bots starts crashing in xfile_create.

Of course all that has bought me is ... more f*** bot harassment.

I'm BURNED OUT, give me a fucking break!
