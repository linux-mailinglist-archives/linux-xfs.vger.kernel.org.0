I agree that it's easy to do. But the reason I wanted to at least have
the discussion about an alternate way of doing this is that I remember a
discussion at Plumbers, or LFS/MM where people were opposed to putting
more and more UUID and other ugly identifiers into kernel log. My memory
is hazy now, but either you or Christoph may have been one of those
people.

But if the consensus shifted since then, I am fine with that.

Thanks!
