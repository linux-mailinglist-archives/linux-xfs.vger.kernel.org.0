Yeah, it's had to have short, concise, distinct names here because
the generic pointer returned is a pointer to per cpu memory that
contains CIL specific per-cpu structures...

I'll fix that, I obviously missed that when trying to clean this up
to be consistent...

The problem with "all" is that it implies a "global" all, not
something that is owned by this specific CIL instance. i.e. there
will be a per-cpu CIL area for every filesystem that is mounted, and
they are actually all linked together into a global list for CPU
hotplug to walk. So "all" CIL pcps to me means walking this list:

static LIST_HEAD(xlog_cil_pcp_list);
static DEFINE_SPINLOCK(xlog_cil_pcp_lock);

which is linked by the cil->xc_pcp_list list heads in each CIL
instance so that CPU hotplug can do the right thing.

"pcp" is typical shorthand for a "per cpu pointer" but it's
horrible when we have pointers to per-cpu lists, lists of per-cpu
aware structures, pointers to per-cpu regions, pointers to per-cpu
data (structures) within per-cpu regions, etc.

There is no way to win here, it's going to be confusing whatever we
do. I've tried to keep it simple:

pcptr			- generic pointer to allocated per CPU region
cil->xc_pcp		- CIL instance pointer to allocated percpu region
cil->xc_pcp_list	- global list for CPU hotplug pcp management

cilpcp			- pointer to specfic CPU instance of the CIL
			  percpu data inside cil->xc_pcp region.

I might just change the generic (void percpu *) regions to "pcp" so
that they align with all the other uses of "pcp" in the naming.

Cheers,

Dave.
