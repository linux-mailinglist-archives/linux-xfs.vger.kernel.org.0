Isn't RHEL7 the oldest one at this point?  And it does systemd.  At this
point the only reason I didn't go full systemd is out of consideration
for Devuan, since they probably need QA.

Yeah, and then you'd still have to figure out fsx and any other random
little utility that a test might run in a background.

<nod> Session IDs kinda suck, but they suck the least for nearly minimal
extra effort.

Ok will change.  I suppose I did go fix up the setting (or not) of
_FSSTRESS_PID.
