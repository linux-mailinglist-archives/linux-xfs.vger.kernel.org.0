That shouldn't happen because XFS_TRANS_RELOG is required of the
transaction, as you noted. Ideally this would at least have an assert.
I'm guessing I didn't do that simply because there was no other reason
to pass the transaction into this function.

I could clean this up, but much of this might go away if the reservation
model changes such that XFS_TRANS_RELOG goes away.

This just means to cancel relogging on a log item. To cancel relogging
only requires to clear the flag, so it doesn't require a transaction at
all at the moment. The waiting bit is for callers (i.e. quotaoff) that
might want to remove the item from the AIL after relogging is disabled.
Without that, the item could still be in the CIL when the caller wants
to remove it.

Hmm, yeah that's a bit of wart. It basically means that an item is
queued for relog by the AIL (similar to an item added to the buffer
writeback list, but not yet submitted). Perhaps RELOG_QUEUED would be a
better name. It's included in this patch because it's used by
xfs_trans_relog_item_cancel(), but I suppose that whole functional hunk
could be added later once the flag is introduced properly.
