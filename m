The answer is yes and yes.

The transaction case you talk about is the same as an inode we are
running a long tx chain on. Say extent removal on an inode with a
few million extents - thinking about this case is somewhat easier to
reason about(*) - the inode stays locked across tx commit and is
re-joined to the next transaction so the extent removal is atomic
from the perspective of the user (i.e.  ftruncate() completes before
any concurrent IO can make progress).

This works from a tx and log perspective because the inode is logged
in *every* transaction of the chain, which has the effect of
continually moving it forward in the log and AIL as the CIL commits in the
background and updates the LSN of the latest modification of the
item in the AIL. Hence the item never needs writeback to unpin the
tail of the log - the act of committing the latest transaction in
the chain will always move it to the head of the log.

IOWs, relogging items that remain locked across transaction commits
is a requirement of permanent transactions to prevent the deadlock
you mention. It's also one of the reasons why we must be able to fit
at least two whole checkpoints in the log - so that items that have
been relogged can unpin the tail of the log when the second
checkpoint completes without requiring writeback of the metadata.
There's some more detail in "Introduction to Re-logging in XFS" in
Documentation/filesystems/xfs-delayed-logging-design.rst", but the
gist of it is above...

(*) Buffers have a couple of extra cases where we do have to be
*really* careful about rolling transactions. The primary one is
INODE_ALLOC buffers, which have to remain pinned in the AIL to their
original LSN even when they are relogged (e.g. for unlinked list
updates) because we cannot move the tail of the log past the LSN
where the inode chunk is initialised on disk without actually
initialising the inode chunk on disk. Hence INODE_ALLOC buffers
cannot be used as the basis of long running atomic TX chains because
they require writeback instead of relogging to unpin the tail of the
log.

Cheers,

Dave.
