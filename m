The same amount of time (~15s per _exercise) as before -- we start
fsstress in the background, wait 10 seconds, run quotaoff, wait 5 more
seconds, and then kill the fsstress process.  Bumping nrops to 1 million
gives fsstress enough work to do that it probably won't exit on its own
before the quotaoff completes.

FWIW the fastest storage I have can run about ~100000 fsstress ops per
minute, so I figured that 1 million ought to do for now.
