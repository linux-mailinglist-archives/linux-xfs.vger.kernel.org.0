Ugh, this will cause churn that will ripple through this and the next
iwalk refactoring patchsets and deferred inactivation.  Can I please
please please defer the churn cleanup until the end of all that?

Ugh.  I should have sent the /next/ iwalk refactoring series along with
this one so that it would become more obvious that the end goal is to
seal all the incore inode walk code in xfs_icache.c, since there are
only four of them (reclaim, inodegc, blockgc, quotaoff) and the grab
functions for all four are just different enough that it's not really
worth it to keep them combined in one function full of conditionals.

Once that's done, the only user of xfs_inode_walk_ag_grab is the blockgc
code and I can rename it.

Ofc the reason I held back is that the next series adds 8 more iwalk
cleanup patches, and the more patches I send all at once the longer it
takes for anyone to start looking at it.  I /still/ can't figure out the
balance between risking overwhelming everyone with too many patches vs.
sending insufficient patches to convey where I'm really going with
something.

<shrug> I might just ping you on irc so that we can have a conversation
about this and summarize whatever we come up with for the list.
