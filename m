Functionality is fine, but the if() that does nothing but contain a
comment is a bit weird. Promote the error handling comment, and that
can formatted as:

		/*
		 * Try to flush all incore state to disk before we examine the
		 * space mappings for the data fork.  Leave accumulated errors
		 * in the mapping for the writer threads to consume.
		 *
		 * On ENOSPC or EIO writeback errors, we continue into the
		 * extent mapping checks because write failures do not
		 * necessarily imply anything about the correctness of the file
		 * metadata.  The metadata and the file data could be on
		 * completely separate devices; a media failure might only
		 * affect a subset of the disk, etc.  We can handle delalloc
		 * extents in the scrubber, so leaving them in memory is fine.
		 */
		error = filemap_fdatawrite(mapping);
		if (!error)
			error = filemap_fdatawait_keep_errors(mapping);
		if (error && (error != -ENOSPC && error !== -EIO))
			goto out;

Cheers,
