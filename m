What do folks think of something like this? We have a user report of a
corresponding read verifier failure while processing unlinked inodes.
This presumably means the attr fork was put in this state because the
format conversion and xattr set are not atomic. For example, the
filesystem crashed after the format conversion transaction hit the log
but before the xattr set transaction. The subsequent recovery succeeds
according to the logic below, but if the attr didn't hit the log the
leaf block remains empty and sets a landmine for the next read attempt.
This either prevents further xattr operations on the inode or prevents
the inode from being removed from the unlinked list due to xattr
inactivation failure.

I've not confirmed that this is how the user got into this state, but
I've confirmed that it's possible. We have a couple band aids now (this
and the writeback variant) that intend to deal with this problem and
still haven't quite got it right, so personally I'm inclined to accept
the reality that an empty attr leaf block is an expected state based on
our current xattr implementation and just remove the check from the
verifier (at least until we have atomic sets). I turned it into a
warning/comment for the purpose of discussion. Thoughts?
