After reading all the discussions, I prefer option 2 here as well, it's
testing for a security bug, and all affected filesystems should be fixed,
and a new failure will remind people there's something to be fixed.

As btrfs doesn't support "finsert", so the falloc/fpunch tests won't run
on btrfs, and we miss test coverage there.

This is weired. And if we really want to restrict the new behavior
within xfs, btrfs and ext4 for now, then I can live with a whitelist
_require rule, and a good comment on it.

Thanks,
