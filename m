Perhaps, though I don't think it's exclusive to an empty AG.

Do we want to consider whether minlen goes to 1? Otherwise that looks
reasonable to me. What I was trying to get at is just that we should
consider whether there are any other corner cases (that we might care
about) where this particular allocation might not behave as expected vs.
just the example used in the original commit log.

If somebody wants to send a finalized patch or two with these fixes
along with the bma.total one (or I can tack it on in reply..?), I'll
think about it further on review as well..
