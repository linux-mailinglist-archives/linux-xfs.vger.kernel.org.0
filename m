It's confusing.

My FAST '15 paper was co-authored with AdvFS developers from the HP 
Storage Division.  The paper mentions the open-source release of AdvFS.

There's not a lot of recent activity on open-source AdvFS:

https://sourceforge.net/p/advfs/discussion/

One thing is certain, however:  HP did not "abandon" AdvFS in 2008.  At 
the time of my FAST paper it was used under the hood in HP products and 
was being actively developed internally.  See Section 3 of the FAST paper. 
The whole point of the paper is to describe a new (internal-only) AdvFS 
feature.

I'm pretty sure (relying on memory) that the changes to AdvFS made by HP 
between 2008 and 2015 did not find their way into the open-source release.
