Hi all,

Establish a baseline golden output for all current fuzz tests.  This
shouldn't be merged upstream because the output is very dependent on the
geometry of the filesystem that is created.

If you're going to start using this code, I strongly recommend pulling
from my git trees, which are linked below.

This has been running on the djcloud for months with no problems.  Enjoy!
Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
