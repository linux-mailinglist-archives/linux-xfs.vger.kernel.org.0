Darrick noted he wasn't clear on the question being asked. I rephrased
it to hopefully add some clarity, not change the answer (?).

(FWIW, the response in the previous version of this series didn't
clearly answer the question from my perspective either, so perhaps that
is why you're seeing it repeated by multiple reviewers. Regardless,
Christoph already replied with more detail so I'll just follow along in
that sub-thread..)
