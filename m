The cursor will have an active reference, hence the perag it holds
cannot be reclaimed until it drops it's reference. THis is the
reason for pushing the perag into the cursor - we can guarantee the
existence of the perag for as long as a btree cursor chain (i.e. the
original cursor + all it's children that were duplicated from it).

Hence I think that checks that the pag is the same memory
address indicate that the perag is still the same.

Yeah, that's something to clean up down the track. Cleaning up
tracepoints have been low on my priority list - just retaining what
they capture is sufficient for the initial conversion....
