Shouldn't that also set filesystem as "dirty" ? The problem is that this
*basically* makes system unbootable without intervention; OS thinks it is c=
lean
so it doesn't run xfs_repair, then driver crashes without marking it unclea=
n,
reboot and process repeats. The crash also blows every mounted XFS system w=
hich
means even if log partition doesn't have that problem none of logs will
persist. I had to reformat /var/log in ext4 to even gather them on my laptop

Yes

It was root in both cases, we keep /boot on ext4

So far (well, we got few hundred more machines to upgrade) I've only seen t=
hat
on old ones, might be some bug that was fixed but left the mark on filesyst=
em ?

That would track, I only saw that on old machines (I think they were format=
ted
around 4.9 kernel release, some even earlier). I just had another case on
machine but this time reading certain files triggered it.
