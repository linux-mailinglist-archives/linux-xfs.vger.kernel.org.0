Why do the dquots need to remain attached after destroy_inode?  We can
easily reattach them during inactivation (v3 did this), and I don't know
why an inode needs dquots once we're through making metadata updates.

Why does it work now, then?  The current code /also/ leaves the dquots
attached to reclaimable inodes, and the quotaoff scan ignores
IRECLAIMABLE inodes.  Has it simply been the case that the dqpurge spins
until reclaim runs, and reclaim gets run quickly enough (or quotaoff runs
infrequently enough) that nobody's complained?
