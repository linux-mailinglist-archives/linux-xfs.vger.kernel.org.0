Commit b5f17bec1213a3ed2f4d79ad4c566e00cabe2a9b has the following,

   2. xfs_force_shutdown() is used in places to cause the current
   modification to be aborted via xfs_trans_commit() because it may be
   impractical or impossible to cancel the transaction directly, and
   hence xfs_trans_commit() must cancel transactions when
   xfs_is_shutdown() is true in this situation. But we can't do that
   because of #1.

I see that xfs_trans_run_precommits() and xfs_defer_finish_noroll() both call
xfs_force_shutdown() when they encounter an error. But these functions could
have percolated the error code to __xfs_trans_commit() and let
__xfs_trans_commit() deal with the scenario more gracefully rather than
checking for log shutdown. Can you please explain why this is
impractical or impossible?
