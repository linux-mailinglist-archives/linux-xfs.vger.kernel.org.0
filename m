Sure, I can do that.

That depends on the exact definition of running the long-soak
and log recovery tests for a week.

I did run the 'recoveryloop' group 100 times on baseline vs. backports
and saw no regressions observed.
Also ran 'auto' 10 times and 'soak' 10 times (and counting) with no
regressions so far.

However, some recoveryloop tests are failing in baseline, so running them
"for a week" is meaningless for those tests:

generic/019, generic/475, generic/648: failing often in all config
generic/388: failing often with reflink_1024
generic/388: failing at ~1/50 rate for any config
generic/482: failing often on V4 configs
generic/482: failing at ~1/100 rate for V5 configs
xfs/057: failing at ~1/200 rate for any config

Note that some of those recoverloop tests may be failing due to older
xfs_repair [*].

The following recoveryloop/soak tests have NOT failed so far:
generic,455, generic/457, generic/646
generic/521, generic/522, generic/642

Should I just keep running those for a week?

Another option is to declare those fixes too risky for LTS 5.10.
That is always an option we need to consider.

Anyway, I will post the full v5.14 series for review and continue
running the long soak tests and the passing tests.

Thanks,
Amir.

[*] I should note that the 5.10.y tests are run with xfsprogs 5.10
When I started testing 5.10.y, I used debian/testing with newer xfsprogs
but that led to many issues compared to debain/bullseye with xfsprogs 5.10.
I figured that it is not very likely for a distro to use kernel 5.10
and much newer
xfsprogs (?) so I preferred to test more aligned versions for kernel/xfsprogs
to match the real life use cases.
