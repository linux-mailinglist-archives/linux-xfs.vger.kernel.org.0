Presumably you meant 5.18-rc2 here?

Hmm, that's a way to do it that I hadn't previously considered.

I think this one is mostly ready to go, with the few nits fixed that you
and I have already posted about.

Hm.  Last time I went through this I was mostly satisfied except for (a)
all of the subtle rules about who owns and frees the attr name/value
buffers, and (b) all that stuff with the alignment/sizing asserts
tripping on fsstress loop tests.

I /think/ Allison's fixed (a), and I think Dave had a patch or two for
(b)?

Oh one more thing:

ISTR one of the problems is that the VFS allocates an onstack
buffer for the xattr name.  The buffer is char[], so the start of it
isn't necessarily aligned to what the logging code wants; and the end of
it (since it's 255 bytes long) almost assuredly isn't.

I thought the XFS part of this patchset looked like it was in good
enough shape to merge, but the actual infrastructure stuff (AKA messing
with mm/ and dax code) hasn't gotten a review.  I don't really have the
depth to know if the changes proposed are good or bad.

I suggest you rebase to something recent (5.17.0 + xfs-5.18-merge-4?)
and send it to the list for a quick once-over before merging that.
IIRC I understood it well enough to have been ok with putting it in.

That said, if you push a branch somewhere I'll give it a spin on my
testfrastructure to see if anything else falls off.

<shrug> No opinions, having never seen this before(?)

At this point my rmap/reflink performance speedups series are ready for
review, but I think the xlog and nrext64 are more than enough for a
single cycle.

I like that you're making the plan explicit.  I'd wanted to talk about
doing this back at LPC 2021, but nobody from RH registered... :(
