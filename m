Darrick has talked about it with us in IRC (as below, hope that helps):

2022-03-16 00:02 < djwong> all that setgid dropping came out of complaints =
that
xfs didn't handle that the same way as all the other linux filesystems
2022-03-16 00:03 < djwong> zlang: ^^^
2022-03-16 00:04 < djwong> originally the xfs setattr more or less did what=
 the
vfs setattr did
2022-03-16 00:04 < djwong> but now people update the vfs setattr and they d=
on't
update the xfs version
2022-03-16 00:05 < djwong> so is this a "unique feature of xfs"?
2022-03-16 00:06 < djwong> inconsistent behavior from xfs?
2022-03-16 00:06 < djwong> or just bitrotting crap in the kernel?
2022-03-16 01:46 < zlang> djwong, sandeen: Thanks! I don't know if there's a
standard describe that, just thought about how should we backport it, hope =
no
customer depend on the old behavior :)
2022-03-16 01:55 < zlang> That would be great if no customer depend on that=
, or
they might complain, if their script expect a program lose S_ISUID and S_IS=
GID
after chown, but not, then cause permission/security problem
2022-03-16 02:00 < zlang> So if we backport that, we might be better to warn
that in doc. To remind them if they hope to "lose" S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits,
better to do that clearly and definitely
2022-03-16 02:01 < djwong> <nod> all that setgid handling is ... very murky
2022-03-16 02:01 < djwong> it at least matches ext4 and btrfs now :P


And another bug report (which can be closed DUP on this one):
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D215693

Darrick has reviewed and replied in IRC (update as below):

2022-03-16 17:10 < zlang> djwong: Did you notice that generic/673 fails on
xfs-5.18-merge-1, looks similar with that chown problem
2022-03-16 17:30 < zlang> https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D215=
693
2022-03-16 17:32 < zlang> But this's about reflink (not chown), and sometim=
es
it lose sgid bit after reflink, sometimes not ...
2022-03-16 17:39 < zlang> So I report a seperate bug to track this question,
please help to review and make sure the new expected behaviors. Sorry to br=
ing
this trouble to you
2022-03-17 00:36 < djwong> zlang: both setgid changes that you filed bugs
against stem from the same setattr_copy issue
2022-03-17 00:37 < djwong> also generic/673 is wrong, see
https://lore.kernel.org/fstests/164740142591.3371628.12793589713189041823.s=
