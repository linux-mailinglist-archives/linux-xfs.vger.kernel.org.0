Ugh, I just want to fix this stupid test and move on with the bugfixes,
not refactor every logwrites user in the codebase just to reduce one
test's runtime from hours to 90s.

It's not as simple as making the logwrites init function set up thinp on
its own, because there's at least one test out there (generic/470) that
takes care of its own discarding, and then there's whatever the strange
stuff that the tests/btrfs/ users do -- it looks fairly simple, but I
don't really want to go digging into that just to make sure I didn't
break their testing.

I'll send what I have currently, which adds a warning about running
logwrites on a device that supports discard but isn't thinp... in
addition to fixing the xfs log recovery thing, and in addition to fixing
the loop duration.

I guess I can add yet another patch to switch the replay program to use
BLKDISCARD if the _init function thinks it's ok, but seriously... you
guys need to send start sending patches implementing the new
functionality that you suggest.
