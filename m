IOWs, XFS has been broken on SLOB for over 5 years and nobody
anywhere has noticed.

And we've just had a discussion where the very best solution was to
use kfree() on kmem_cache_alloc() objects so we didn't ahve to spend
CPU doing global type table lookups or use an extra 8 bytes of
memory per object to track the slab cache just so we could call
kmem_cache_free() with the correct slab cache.

But, of course, SLOB doesn't allow this and I was really tempted to
solve that by adding a Kconfig "depends on SLAB|SLUB" option so that
we don't have to care about SLOB not working.

However, as it turns out that XFS on SLOB has already been broken
for so long, maybe we should just not care about SLOB code and
seriously consider just adding a specific dependency on SLAB|SLUB...

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Dave.
