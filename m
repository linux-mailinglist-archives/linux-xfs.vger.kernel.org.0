Yes.  But not doing this automatically also means you keep easily
forgetting callsites.  For example iomap still does not flush the plug
in your patch.

Ok, makes sense.

It doesn't.  Just look at the conditional you replaced for example :)

True.  So I guess we'll need a new flag to distinguish the cases.
