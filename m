Sorry, I was referring to moving your new [W|DIR]SYNC variants to
somewhere like xfs_trans_res->tr_logflags in the comment above, not the
existing XFS_TRANS_SYNC flag (which I would keep). Regardless, I didn't
think that would work across the board from looking at it before.
Perhaps it would work in some cases..

I agree that the current approach is confusing in that it's not always
clear when to set the sync flag. I disagree that this patch makes it
obvious and in one place because when I see this:

	error = xfs_trans_commit(args->trans, XFS_TRANS_COMMIT_WSYNC);

... it makes me think the flag has an immediate effect (like COMMIT_SYNC
does) and subsequently raises the same questions around the existing
code of when or when not to use which flag in the context of the
individual transaction. *shrug* Just my .02.
