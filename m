Ok, sure. I will try to upgrade the kernel version and run the test again.
But I don't own the test hardware. This issue can't be reproduced on any
machines, so I might not reply to you very quickly.  The worst situation is
I can't use the hardware any more. But once I get the test result I will ge=
t
back to you and answer all your questions as soon as possible.

Thank you again.
