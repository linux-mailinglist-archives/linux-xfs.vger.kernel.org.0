Looks like so. I'm wondering if the deadlock is only possible with
single ag xfs (case 1) or single ag is just more easier to hit the
deadlock (case 2).

If it's case 1, I think we could make the test generic by only adding
extra xfs-specific mkfs option when FSTYP is xfs, e.g.

mkfs_opts=""
# here goes comments explaining why xfs needs single ag
if [ "$FSTYP" == "xfs" ]; then
	mkfs_opts="-d agcount=1"
fi

If it's case 2, that depends on what's the posibility to reproduce
without single ag. I can afford 5%-10% or even lower reproduce
posibility (given that the deadlock is a corner case and isn't likely to
happen with normally formatted xfs) to drop "-d agcount=1". So the test
has nothing xfs-specific.

If the reproduce posibility is near 0, then we could go to case 1.

yeah, adding renameat2 operations to fsstress looks like a good idea to
extend the test coverage. But that belongs to another patch.

I agreed, unless the frequency is zero :) As mentioned above, I can
afford smaller frequency if test runs faster. Also, we could scale the
test time based on TIME_FACTOR and add 'stress' group too. (You could
grep for TIME_FACTOR in tests/ dir for examples.)
