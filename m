This looks reasonable, but I'm wondering how the original problem
was discovered and whether this has been tested against that
original problem situation to ensure we aren't introducing a
regression here....

FWIW, I think this is a low-ball number - each EFI also consumes an
ophdr (12 bytes) for the region identifier in the log, so it's
actually 44 bytes, not 32 bytes that will be consumed.  It is not
necessary to address this in this patchset, though.

Cheers,

Dave.
