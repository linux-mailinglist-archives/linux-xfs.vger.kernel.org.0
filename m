Yes, but have you looked at what they are?

$ grep -Rl static.*inline /usr/include/xfs/
/usr/include/xfs/linux.h
/usr/include/xfs/xfs_arch.h
/usr/include/xfs/xfs_da_format.h
/usr/include/xfs/xfs_format.h
/usr/include/xfs/xfs_fs.h
/usr/include/xfs/xfs_log_format.h
/usr/include/xfs/xfs_types.h
$

The platform functions (linux.h) are explicitly
shipped as static inlines to avoid needing a compiled library to
use.

The byte swapping (xfs_arch.h) is a mess of macros and static
inlines that have no external dependencies. They are simply byte
swapping functions.

The on-disk format headers contain some helper functions. We try to
keep them out of htose headers because of the wide includes they get
in kernel and that creates header dependency hell. Hence the only
static inline code in them allowed is code that only uses structures
already specifically defined in the on-disk format header functions.
This avoids the dependency hell that these foundational header files
might otherwise create.

Further, they have nothing to do with the actual kernel API or
fundamental XFS type definitions, so very few applications are
actually using these header files. Hence it's not critical to keep
code out of them, and we -never- care if they fail to compile with
c++ compilers because they are aren't for general application
usage....

That leaves xfs_fs.h and xfs_types.h:

$ grep static.*inline libxfs/xfs_fs.h libxfs/xfs_types.h
libxfs/xfs_fs.h:static inline uint32_t
libxfs/xfs_fs.h:static inline struct xfs_getparents_rec *
libxfs/xfs_fs.h:static inline struct xfs_getparents_rec *
libxfs/xfs_types.h:static inline bool
$

There are -four- functions in 6.10, up from 2 in 6.9. These 2 new
helper functions are the source of the problem. IOWs, our general
rule to keep code out of these two files has largely worked over the
years...

Direct kernel uapi header includes are a different issue and the
policy for them is not in our control at all.

We've used the "no code in xfs_fs.h and xfs_types.h" rule to avoid
these problems in the past. The whole point of xfs_types.c existing
is to provide a location for type verifier code that isn't
xfs_types.h. The verification code has dependencies on xfs_mount,
xfs_perag, etc, and we simply cannot put such code in xfs_types.h
because it creates circular header file dependencies.

IOWs, xfs_fs.h and xfs_types.h are foundational definitions for both
kernel and userspace code. Adding static inline code into them leads
to external header dependencies, and that is something we have
always tried our best to avoid.  Hence the general rule is no static
inline code in these header files.

Clearly this was missed in review - it's a tiny chunk of code in the
massive merges that have recently occurred, and so it's no surprise
that little things like this get missed when reviewing tens of=20
thousands of lines of new code.

Put whatever thing you want in place to catch header compilation
issues in userspace, but the basic, fundamental principle is that no
static inline code should be placed in xfs_types.h and xfs_fs.h.

Sure, that fixes the compilation problem, but that's not the bug
that needs to be fixed. This code should not have been added to this
file in the first place.
