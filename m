Resurrected and under testing now.  While forward porting your patch
I noticed it could be much simpler even without the refactor by just
using xfs_trans_set_sync.  The downside of that is that the log force
is under the inode locks, but so are the log forces for all other wysnc
induced log forces.  So I think you should just submit this in the
simplified version matching the rest of the wsync users as a fix. If
we want to optimize it later on that should be done as a separate patch
and for all wsync/dirsync users.
