An RCU grace period typically takes some milliseconds to complete, so a
great many inodes would end up being tagged for the same grace period.
For example, if "rm -rf" could delete one file per microsecond, the
first few thousand files would be tagged with one grace period,
the next few thousand with the next grace period, and so on.

In the unlikely event that RCU was totally idle when the "rm -rf"
started, the very first file might get its own grace period, but
they would batch in the thousands thereafter.

On start_poll_synchronize_rcu() vs. get_state_synchronize_rcu(), if
there is always other RCU update activity, get_state_synchronize_rcu()
is just fine.  So if XFS does a call_rcu() or synchronize_rcu() every
so often, all you need here is get_state_synchronize_rcu()().

Another approach is to do a start_poll_synchronize_rcu() every 1,000
events, and use get_state_synchronize_rcu() otherwise.  And there are
a lot of possible variations on that theme.

But why not just try always doing start_poll_synchronize_rcu() and
only bother with get_state_synchronize_rcu() if that turns out to
be too slow?

Even on a 32-bit system that is running RCU grace periods as fast as they
will go, it will take about 12 days to overflow that counter.  But if
you have an inode sitting on the list for that long, yes, you could
see unnecessary synchronous grace-period waits.

Would it help if there was an API that gave you a special cookie value
that cond_synchronize_rcu() and friends recognized as "already expired"?
That way if poll_state_synchronize_rcu() says that original cookie
has expired, you could replace that cookie value with one that would
stay expired.  Maybe a get_expired_synchronize_rcu() or some such?
