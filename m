OK fair enough.

I guess my overarching desire here is to not try to predict too much, or to
make predictions that won't stand the test of time. Inferring what the admin
wants can be tricky.  :)  

I also want to be consistent; i.e. today we can mkfs a 64k block filesystem
on a 4k block machine, and no warning is emitted. If we mkfs a V5/CRC filesystem
or a reflink filesystem on an old kernel that doesn't support it, no warning is
emitted.

If we're going to warn every time when "this filesystem can't be used under the
currently running kernel" then there are quite a lot of cases to handle... I
don't want to warn about some things and not others, so we need to decide if
this is actually something we want to do in general, not just for dax.  I'm 
somewhat disinclined, TBH, and would rather rely on a mount failure to alert
the admin to the problem.  (It's not like there are a lot of resources invested
between mkfs & mount).

I'll reread this thread & Dave's responses and give this some more thought.

Thanks,
