Hi Darrick,

Thanks for your quick and detailed reply.

The thing that really puzzled me when I re-ran Suyash's experiments on a 
DRAM-backed file system is that the ioctl(FICLONE) calls were still very 
very slow.  A slow block storage device can't be blamed, because there 
wasn't a slow block storage device anywhere in the picture; the slowness 
came from software.

Suyash, can you send those results?
