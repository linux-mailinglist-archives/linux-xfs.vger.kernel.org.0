I'm contemplating add the superblock option to bcachefs as well, that
would fit well with using this for working with metadata dumps too.
("Yes, we know all data checksums are wrong, it's fine").

Another thing that makes this exceedingly useful - SSDs these days are
_garbage_ in terms of getting consistent results. Without this, run to
run variance is ridiculous without a bunch of prep between each test
(that takes longer than the test itself).
