Thanks Darrick. This looks technically correct to me as well.

You might want to add a:

Fixes: 7317a03df703f ("xfs: refactor inode ownership change transaction/inode/quota allocation idiom")

because I /think/ that's the commit that moved the capable() checks out
from under quota tests, and made the problem more visible.

And maybe:

Fixes: ea9a46e1c4925 ("xfs: only return detailed fsmap info if the caller has CAP_SYS_ADMIN")

as well?

It's not strictly fixing the former; AFAICT the problem existed when quota was
enabled already, so I'll leave all that to your discretion.
