I'm happy to see everything up to here merged.

However, I think these still need work. The state machine mechanism
needs more factoring so that there is a function per state/action
that moves the state forwards one step, rather than the current
setup where a single function might handle 3-5 different states by
jumping to different parts of the code.

I started thinking that this was largely just code re-arrangement,
but as I started to to do a bit of cleanup onit as an example, I
think there's some bugs in the code that might be leading to leaking
buffers and other such stuff. So I think this code really needs a
good cleanup and going over before it will be ready to merge.

I've attached an untested, uncompiled patch below to demonstrate
how I think we should start flattening this out. It takes
xfs_attr_set_iter() and flattens it into a switch statement which
calls fine grained functions. There are a couple of new states to
efficiently jump into the state machine based on initial attr fork
format, and xfs_attr_set_iter() goes away entirely.

Note that I haven't flattened the second level of function calls out
into a function per state, which is where it's like to see this end
up. i.e. we don't need to call through xfs_attr_leaf_addname() to
just get to another switch statement to jump to the code that flips
the flags.

The factoring and flattening process is the same, though: isolate
the code that needs to run to a single function, call it from the
state machine switch. That function then selects the next state to
run, whether a transaction roll is necessary, etc, and the main loop
then takes care of it from there.

Allison, if you want I can put together another couple of patches
like the one below that flatten it right out into fine grained
states and functions. I think having all the state machien
transitions in one spot makes the code much easier to understand
and, later, to simplify and optimise.

Cheers,

Dave.
