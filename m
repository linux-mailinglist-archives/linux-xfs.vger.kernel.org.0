I'm *really* surprised that people are only realising that IO
completion processing for atomic writes *must be atomic*.

This was the foundational constraint that the forced alignment
proposal for XFS was intended to address. i.e. to prevent fs
operations from violating atomic write IO constraints (e.g. punching
sub-atomic write size holes in the file) so that the physical IO can
be done without tearing and the IO completion processing that
exposes the new data can be done atomically.

I'm pretty sure we enforced that in the XFS mapping implemention for
atomic writes using forced alignment. i.e.  we have to return a
correctly aligned, contiguous mapping to iomap or we have to return
-EINVAL to indicate atomic write mapping failed.

Yes, we can check this in iomap, but it's really the filesystem that
has to implement and enforce it...
