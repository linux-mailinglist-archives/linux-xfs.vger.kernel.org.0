I wish Leah had, but there basically aren't any tests for the problems
fixed in this set for her to find. :(

The first two patches I think were from when Dave was working on log
intent whiteouts, turned on KASAN to diagnose some other problem he had,
and began pulling on the ball of string (as it were) as he noticed other
things in the codebase.  We don't usually bother with regression tests
for kernel memory leaks, since they're not so easy to reproduce.

Patches 3-6 are fixes for a rash of fuzzer reports that someone in China
posted last May:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215927

(There are more than just that one)

As usual, the submitter didn't bother to help triage and just dumped a
ton of work in our laps.  They didn't follow up with any regression
tests, because few fuzz kiddiez ever do.  At the time, I was too burned
out to deal with it, so Dave posted fixes.

Patches 7-8 would manifest themselves as test VMs halting on ASSERTs if
you configure your kernel to panic.  Not strictly needed since most LTS
kernels probably don't even have XFS_DEBUG=y, but it makes the lives of
recoveryloop runners easier if they do.

Patch 9 trips xfs/434 and xfs/436, but they only run if you have slab
debugging enabled and build XFS as a module.  I don't know why very few
people do this.

Patch 10 is a memory leak if you have XFS_DEBUG=y.  No need for a
separate test for this one, since kmemleak catches it.  If you turn it
on.

(IOWs, LGTM for the whole set.)

<nod> Dave's fixpatches rarely have Fixes tags attached.  It's difficult
to get him to do that because he has so much bad history with AUTOSEL.
I've tried to get him to add them in the past, but if I'm already
stressed out and Dave doesn't reply then I tend to merge the fix and
move on.

Whenever y'all get to 6.0, beware of commit 2ed5b09b3e8f ("xfs: make
inode attribute forks a permanent part of struct xfs_inode"), which is a
KASAN UAF that we fixed by eliminating the 'F'.  Do not pull on the
devilstring ("...the file capabilities code calls getxattr with and
without i_rwsem held...") if you can avoid it.

Oh good, I've been (gently) waiting on that one too. :)
