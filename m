xfs_db can also write to the filesystem; see -x mode.

But first -- let's zoom out here.  You're adding flock() calls to
xfsprogs to coordinate two userspace programs udev and mkfs.xfs.  Why
wouldn't you add the same flock()ing to the rest of the xfs utilities so
that they also don't step on each other?

xfs_mdrestore can also write an XFS image to a block device, so what
makes it special?

"Unlikely" isn't good enough -- xfsprogs don't control the udev rules,
which means that a program invoked by a udev rule could read just about
anywhere in the block device.  Hence we need to prevent udev from
getting confused about /any/ block that xfs_repair might write.

(You /do/ know that xfs_db and xfs_repair can rewrite the primary
superblock, right?)

xfs utilities can't know what kinds of writes will or will not trigger
udev rules, since the sysadmin can install arbitrary udev rules.

Er... well, I guess it's good to know that xfs isn't /completely/ behind
the curve here.
