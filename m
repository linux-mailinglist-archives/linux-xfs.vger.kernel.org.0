Ok, this had come up in the last review too, we had tried to simplify it 
to an "is_leaf" helper, though it turned out the logic didnt quite work 
the same functionally, so I put it back and renamed it "needs_update". 
I think "is_shortform" is a closer description though.  Will update.

Sure, I actually had it more like that in the last version.  I flipped 
it around because I thought it would help people understand what the 
refactoring was for if they could see it in context with the states. 
But if the other way is more helpful, its easy to put back.  Will move :-)
