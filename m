It might be worth explicitly pointing out that support for EFI/EFD
intents goes farther back than the various intents associated with newer
features, hence the value of a targeted fix. Otherwise the problem
description makes sense and approach seems reasonable to me. Thanks for
the writeup. Some questions...

tr_itruncate.tr_logcount looks like it's either 2 or 8 depending on
whether reflink is enabled. On one hand this seems conservative enough,
but do we know exactly what those extra unit counts are accounted for in
the reflink case? It looks like extents are only freed when the last
reference is dropped (otherwise we log a refcount intent), which makes
me wonder whether we really need 7 log count units if recovery
encounters an EFI.

Also, while looking through the code I noticed that truncate does the
following:

		...
                error = xfs_defer_finish(&tp);
                if (error)
                        goto out;

                error = xfs_trans_roll_inode(&tp, ip);
                if (error)
                        goto out;
		...

... which looks like it rolls the transaction an extra time per-extent.
I don't think that contributes to this problem vs just being a runtime
inefficiency, so maybe I'll fling a patch up for that separately.
