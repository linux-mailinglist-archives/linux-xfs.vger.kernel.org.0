Yes, that's long been a known problem - it was a problem way back in
the day for DMF and the DMAPI attributes that needed to be added at
create time. That's where XFS_TRANS_RESERVE originally came from, so
that ENOSPC didn't prevent the dmapi xattr from being added to a
newly created inode.

This atomicity problem is one of the things that Allison's attribute
defer-op rework is intended to address.  i.e. being able to
atomically create xattrs at inode create time and have them fully
recoverable by intent replay if the initial inode allocation and
directory linkage transaction succeeds.

Essential the transaction context would start in
xfs_generic_create(), not xfs_create(), and roll through to the
xattr creations for ACLs and security contexts...

Problem is that it appears to need an inode to already be allocated
and instantiated to work....

Yeah, it's like a layer of inscrutible obscurity has been added to a
simple ops table... :/

Cheers,
