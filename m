LOLYUP.

Hey Catherine, are you interested in /removing/ the quota warning limit
code from XFS?  Note: just the limits, not the actually issuance of
quota warnings (xfs_quota_warn) nor the warning counter itself.

I think a good place to start would be to remove the 'warn' field from
struct xfs_quota_limits, and then remove code as necessary to fix all
the compilation errors.  I think you can leave the actual warning
counter itself (struct xfs_dquot_res.warnings) since it (roughly) tracks
how many times we've sent a warning over netlink to ... wherever they
go.
