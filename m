Ahh.  Yeah, ok, got it, you don't necessarily want to prefault a bunch
more merkle tree blocks all at once just to read a single byte. :)

Me neither.  I /think/ invalidate_mapping_pages would do the job, though
one would probably want to have a custom shrinker so we could find out
just how many pages are desired by reclaim, and then try to invalidate
only that many pages.  Not sure what happens if there are multiple
mappings whose ->host pointers point to the same inode.

Alternately I wonder if we could make a tmpfs file that would evict live
contents instead of writing them to the paging file... ;)
