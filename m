Yes, that's how the current code works. It ends up leaking whatever
was in those 3 bytes into the shadow buffer that we then copy into
the log region. i.e. the existing code "leaks" non-zeroed allocated
memory to the journal.

Yes, we copy 37 bytes out of the ifork buffer now into the shadow
buffer so we do not overrun the inode fork buffer.

We does indeed still leak the remaining 3 bytes as they are not
zeroed.

No, we definitely don't do that - KASAN gets very unhappy when you
do that...

The shadow buffer is only partially zeroed - the part that makes io
the header and iovec pointer array is zeroed, but the region that
the journal data is written to is not zeroed.

> (FWIW I'm just checking for kernel memory exposure vectors here.)

Yup, I hadn't even considered that aspect of the code because we
aren't actually leaking anything to userspace. If an unprivileged
user can read 3 bytes of uninitialised data out of the journal we've
got much, much bigger security problems to deal with.

It should be trivial to fix, though. I'll do the initial fix as a
standalone patch, though, and then roll it into this one because the
problem has been around for a long while and fixing this patch
doesn't produce an easily backportable fix...

Cheers,

Dave.
