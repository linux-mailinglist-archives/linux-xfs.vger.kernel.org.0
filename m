Well, the initial fix are the first two patches.  This patch really
just adds a safety belt.  I'll happily take over the effort to get
sensible checks in the block code if you give me a couple weeks,
in the meantime I'd prefer if we could skip this third patch for now.

True.  And we need to improve the interface here, which I'm going
to try to fit into my series that lift some common bio filling code
to the core.  I'll add you to the cc list.
