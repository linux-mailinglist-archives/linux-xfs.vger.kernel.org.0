Dear Beloved Brother /Sister

Good Day

I am Mrs. Lisa Williams very sick and admitted in the hospital bed
permanently without no movement as I need to go in for surgical
operation and I suffered  partial stroke that affected my tongue and
my speech as well. Please can you help me to receive the sum of $4.5
Million Dollars [Four Million, Five Hundred Thousand United State
Dollars Only] for investment in your country. Having viewed and study
your statue on-line which motivated me that you can be trusted with
this project. The money is in over sea bank .Kindly help me for this
project before I die.

I want my part to go to charities  through you for the good work of
the Lord, and to help the motherless, less privileged Orphans and
widows? Please can you invest part of the money for me in real estate
in your Country too. I will give you all the details as soon as I hear
from you.

Please reply with out delay. God bless you and your family.



Mrs. Lisa Williams
