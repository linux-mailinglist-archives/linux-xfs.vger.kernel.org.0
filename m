I was just reusing an existing lock rather than having to add yet
another global scope spinlock just for the shutdown. I can add
another lock but...

... as you point out, m_flags is a mess when it comes to races. I've
got a series somewhere that addresses this... Yeah:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20180820044851.414-1-david@fromorbit.com/

And that does similar things bit making state changes atomic as this
patchset does, in which case the lock around this shutdown state
change goes away...

I need to rebase that series and get it moving again, because we
really do need to split m_flags up into features and atomic
operational state, too. In the mean time, I considered using the
m_sb_lock largely harmless...

It's run on the majority of shutdowns already, but not all. It makes
no sense to have an error level triggered stack dump on shutdown and
not actually use it multiple shutdown vectors - that has been
problematic in the past when trying to diagnose shutdown causes in
the field. I'll add a comment to the commit description.

Removed.
