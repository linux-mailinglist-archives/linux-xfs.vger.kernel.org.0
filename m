I agree with you here, and we could slowly start marking those shared accesses
as racy, but bots spitting false-positivies all the time doesn't help much,
other than taking somebody's else time to look into the report.

Taking as example one case in the previous report, where the report complained
about concurrent bp->b_addr access during the buffer instantiation.

This seems to be covered by the access-marking.txt doc:

"
...
Churning the code base with ill-considered additions of data_race(),
READ_ONCE(), and WRITE_ONCE() is unhelpful.
...
"

Then:

"
...
Use of Plain C-Language Accesses

2.	Initialization-time and cleanup-time accesses.	This covers
	a  wide variety of situations, including the uniprocessor
	phase of system boot, variables to be used by not-yet-spawned
	kthreads, structures not yet published to reference-counted
	or RCU-protected data structures, and the cleanup side of any
	of these situations.
...
"

So, I think Dave has a point too. Like what happens with syzkaller
and random people reporting random syzkaller warnings.

While I appreciate the reports too, I think it would be fair for the reporters
to spend some time to at least craft a RFC patch fixing the warning.

In this case for example, the reporter explicitly mentioned data_race()
annotations, so, why not just send a patch attempting fix the warning instead of
asking somebody else to do that? IMHO, somebody fidgeting with KCSAN has enough
skills to craft such patch. Of course I might be wrong here, but tweaking debug
knobs over the kernel and asking somebody else to look at the results doesn't
seem scalable.

Cheers.
