Sure, easy enough to do.

OK. I just used ENOSPC everywhere for this error as a starting
point. I didn't think too hard about what the exact error should be
for all situations, I just needed something that would stand out
from the crowd...

No, the buffer is just holding a passive reference to the perag, and
that alone is not enough to protect/serialise against a shrink of
offline AG operation. That's what the active references do.

I was looking at this last night - there's a bunch of cases were we
can use passive references from the buffer, but they all require a
context where there's a higher level object that pins the AG against
shrink. e.g. an inode will pin against shrink, because the existence
of an inode in cache in that AG means the AG is not empty. Shrink
cannot proceed until the inode cache for that AG has been fully
reclaimed and new lookups cannot occur. The example I used was NFS
filehandle lookups need to ESTALE without actually being able to
access the perag, so we need an active reference for xfs_iget() to
be able to populate the cache...

That said, I think as many bp->b_pag use cases possible should be
converted to active references before we take AG header buffer locks
so that the mechanism can (eventually) be used as a general "make no
modifications to the AG" mechanism, rather than just being specific
to the needs of shrink.

Right, that's the question that lead me to just using ENOSPC
everywhere.

We have to serialise it against shrink in some way, because the AG
could be in the process of being torn down and the agcounts may be
invalid at this point.

I'd like to see these 0..sb_agcount loops go away and get replaced
with perag iterators similar to the one you added to xfs_icache.c:

#define for_each_perag_tag(mp, next_agno, pag, tag) \
        for ((next_agno) = 0, (pag) = xfs_perag_get_tag((mp), 0, (tag)); \
                (pag) != NULL; \
                (next_agno) = (pag)->pag_agno + 1, \
                xfs_perag_put(pag), \
                (pag) = xfs_perag_get_tag((mp), (next_agno), (tag)))

Then all of these loops that immediately just get/grab a perag
can hide all of this mess and operate solely on perag structures.
Essentially, everywhere we pass an agno to indicate "operate on this
AG" should pass an actively referenced perag, not a raw agno. We
already do this in some places, but there's still a bunch of cleanup
needed to make this work 100% reliably.

Cheers,

Dave.
