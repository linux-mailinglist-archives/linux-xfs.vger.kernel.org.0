Perhaps so.

It doesn't worry me how we resolve this - I just pointed it out
because it's not mentioned in the commit message and I wanted to
make sure it wasn't an oversight. If there are better ways to get
this information from tracepoints and XFS_FSB_TO_AGNO() does
something safe and obvious with NULLFSBLOCK (e.g. ends up as -1)
then as long as there's mention of this change in the commit message
I'm fine with it as it is.

Cheers,

Dave.
