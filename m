Wow, thanks for writing this up! This looks great to me, feel free to send it 
as a real patch and I will happily add my Reviewed-by.

My general opinion is that debugfs files don't mandate user-facing 
documentation since they are by their very nature kernel developer features, 
but you're right that it would reduce confusion here to have something written 
to reference for people who want to add printk index entries, so this makes 
sense.

>+Subsystem specific printk wrappers
>+==================================
>+
>+The printk index is generated using extra metadata that are stored in

>+wrappers doing __printk_index_emit() together with the real printk()
>+call. The same technique is used also for the metadata used by

>+The metadata are stored for a particular message only when it is printed

>+
>+It needs additional changes for variaous subsystem specific wrappers that
>+call the original printk() via a common helper function. These needs
>+they own wrappers adding __printk_index_emit().
>+
>+Only few subsystem specific wrappers have been updated so far,
>+for example, dev_printk(). Only the generic string from the common
>+helper function appears in the printk index for others.
>+
>+
>+Subsystem specific prefix
>+=========================
>+
>+The macro pr_fmt() macro allows to define a prefix that is printed
>+before the string generated by the related printk() calls.
>+
>+Subsystem specific wrappers usually add even more complicated
>+prefixes.
>+
>+These prefixes can be stored into the printk index metadata
>+by an optional parameter of __printk_index_emit(). The debugfs
>+interface might then show the printk formats including these prefixes.

>+  {
>+	acpi_gbl_auto_serialize_methods = FALSE;
