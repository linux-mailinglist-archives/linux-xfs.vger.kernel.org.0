Not possible because xlog_write_setup_ophdr() is removed by this
patch. I can't help it if the diffs are unreadable - I can't really
control what git is doing here...

Ah, that was to do with the avoiding the need to split the start
record/transaction header of across two iclogs. That was because the
partial copy loop didn't have special handling for start records
and so that log vector had to be wholly handled by the
xlog_write_single() loop to set the iclog flush flags.

However, with all the changes since then that have added explicit
pre-flushes before the start record is formatted and the lifting of
the iclog flush flags to the callers, we've removed all
the special optype handling in xlog_write(). Hence we no longer need
to guarantee the start record is handled by the single path, it now
can be handled by this partial path just fine. So I can revert this
hunk.

Did I mention that this code was full of all sorts of subtle corner
cases? :/

Cheers,

Dave.
