The link in the 9 May report:

https://lore.kernel.org/oe-kbuild-all/202304140707.CoH337Ux-lkp@intel.com/

goes to an old report from 14 April involving gcc 12.1 on powerpc and
doesn't mention xfs at all.

AFAICT there aren't any actual build failures, just the smatch warning.

Yes, it is the smatch warning.  Sprinkling #if 0's everywhere makes
the smatch warning go away, but the "shut up the warnings" fix isn't
necessarily better:
