As for this question ^^^ ... <URRRK>.

I thought the overall strategy was to get everything in xfsprogs using
libfrog wrappers that would degrade gracefully on old kernels.

For xfsdump/restore, I think we should just merge it into xfsprogs and
then it can use our wrappers.

For everything else... I thought the story was that you shouldn't really
be using xfs ioctls unless you're keeping up with upstream.

<shrug> Feel free to differ, that's just a braindump of my shattered
mind. :P
