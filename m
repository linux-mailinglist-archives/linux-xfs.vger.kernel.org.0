I wasn't planning on a v3. The discussion to this point has been
centered around the xfs_force_shutdown() call in the associated function
(which is orthogonal to the bug). v1 is technically correct, but
Christoph suggested to restore historical behavior wrt to the shutdown
call. v2 does that, but is a bit superfluous in that the iclog error
state with the lock held implies shutdown has already occurred. This is
harmless (unless we're worried about shutdown performance or
something..), but I think Dave indicated he preferred v1 based on that
reasoning.

Functionally I don't think it matters either way and at this point I
have no preference between v1 or v2. They fix the same problem. Do note
that v2 does have the Fixed: tag I missed with v1 (as well as a R-b)...
