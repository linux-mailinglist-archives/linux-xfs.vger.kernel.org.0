No. This is Obviously Stupid.

Did you listen to what Darrick just said? Wasn't it "Don't go making
us clutter up shared library code..."?

If we're complaining that replacing obvious comments demonstrating
intent with weird macros is not in our best interest, then replacing
the comments with an eye-bleeding, one off, XFS specific macro
doesn't address the objections being raised.

I don't even know why you are continuing trying to convince us to
take the changes - Darrick has already given you guys the option of
going straight to Linus with them. If you do that then we'll just
have to deal with the undefined macro fallout that results in
userspace.

Please just stop wasting more of our time on this.

-Dave.
