From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

xfs_log_mount_finish() needs to know if recovery is needed or not to
make descisions on whether to flush the log and AIL.  Move the
handling of the NEED_RECOVERY state out to this function rather than
needing a temporary variable to store this state over the call to
xlog_recover_finish().
