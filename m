Interesting. This makes me wonder a few things.

This approach differs from the just-added handling of 
XFS_SB_FEAT_INCOMPAT_NEEDSREPAIR, where we /always/ ignore it. For now I think
that's a little different, because that flag only gets set from userspace, but
that could change in the future, maybe?

So I wonder why we have this feature getting noted and cleared, but the other
one always ignored.

I also notice that scrub tries to avoid setting it in the first place:

         * Don't write out a secondary super with NEEDSREPAIR or log incompat
         * features set, since both are ignored when set on a secondary.

... should growfs avoid it as well?

It feels like we're spreading this special handling around, copying (or not)
and ignoring (or not) at various points.  I kinda want to step back and think
about this a little.

It seems like the most consistent approach would be to always keep all supers
in sync, though I suppose that has costs. The 2nd most consistent approach would
be to never copy these ephemeral features to the secondary.

Whatever the consistent future looks like, I guess we do have to deal with
inconsistent stuff in the wild, already.

Thoughts?
