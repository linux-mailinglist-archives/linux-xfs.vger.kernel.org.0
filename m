(whoops, this didn't get sent yesterday...?)

Thanks Darrick. I'm throwing in the towel on my usual approach of doing the
sync myself and comparing notes. I'm going to just treat this as a straight-up
review, primarily focusing on the not-kernel-crossports, and just pull in
your work because I clearly amd not getting this one done in a timely manner.

Thank you for this effort :)
