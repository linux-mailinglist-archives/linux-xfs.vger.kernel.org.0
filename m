/me wonders if it would be useful for future spelunkers to retain some
sort of comment here that we once thought count==0 was bad but screwed
it up enough that we now allow it?

Moreso that future me/fuzzrobot won't come along having forgotten
everything and think "Oh, we need to validate hdr.count!" :P
