I think you are right. Most likely we were able to successfully allocate less
than XFS_SYMLINK_MAPS (i.e. 3) and the next allocation only found free extents
whose length were larger than 1 FSB.

The test fills 90% of the filesystem and then punches holes at every other
block used by each of the "filler" files. So the filesystem could have some
"free extents" whose size is larger than 1 FSB. These larger free extents
allowed the block reservation to succeed.

During the test run, we could have consumed all the 1 FSB sized free extents
and hence a later allocation attempt can fail since we were trying to allocate
only 1 FSB sized extent.

I have modifed xfs/538 to perform only write* and symlink
operations. Unfortunately, the test hasn't failed yet despite running for 27
iterations. I will let it run during the weekend.
