They're not ENOSPC failures, they're fallocate layout tests that assume
that you can format the fs with a stripe alignment, fragment the free
space so that it isn't possible to obtain stripe-aligned blocks, delete
80% of the file(s) you used to fragment the free space, and fallocate a
stripe-aligned extent from the newly freed space in one go after the
last unlink() returns.  Unfortunately, I don't remember which test it
was that tripped over this.

IOWs, tests that confirm the historic behavior of XFS (and presumably
other filesystems) even though we don't guarantee anything about file
layout and never have.  This is a similar issue to the one Dave
complains about a few patches ago about needing to kick the inodegc
workers so that df reporting behavior stays the same as it has been on
xfs for ages.

We /might/ have figured out a solution to some of that nastiness.

Ooh!  You mentioned "efficient feedback", and one sprung immediately to
mind -- if the AG is near full (or above 80% full, or whatever) we
schedule the per-AG inodegc worker immediately instead of delaying it.
