Hmm... it strikes me as a little odd that we're checking file mode and
fork type in the middle of the bmap code.  However, I think it's the
case that the only place where anyone would punch a hole in the /middle/
of an extent is xattr trees and regular files, right?  And both of those
cases are checked before we end up in the bmap code, right?

So we only really need this check to prevent extent count overflows when
removing dirents from directories, like the comment says, and only
because directories don't have a hard requirement that the bunmapi
succeeds.  And I think this logic covers xfs_remove too?  That's a bit
subtle, but as there's no extent count check in that function, there's
not much to attach a comment to... :)

Hm.  I think I'd like xfs_rename to get a brief comment that we're
protected from extent count overflows in xfs_remove() by virtue of this
"leave the dir block in place if we ENOSPC" capability:

	/*
	 * NOTE: We don't need to check for extent overflows here
	 * because the dir removename code will leave the dir block
	 * in place if the extent count would overflow.
	 */
	error = xfs_dir_removename(...);

Do xattr trees also have the same ability?  I think they do, at least
for the dabtree part...?

I think I would've split this patch into three pieces:

 - create, link, and symlink in one patch (adding dirents),
 - the xfs_bmap_del_extent_real change and a comment for xfs_remove
   (removing dirents)
 - all the xfs_rename changes (adding and removing dirents)

Though I dunno, this series is already 14 patches, and the part that I
care most about is not leaving that subtlety in xfs_remove(). :)

Other than that, I follow the logic in this patch and will give it a
testrun tonight.
