Subject: [PATCHBOMB] fstests: catch us up to 6.12-6.14 changes

Hi everyone,

As most developers are aware, the fstests for-next branch has not moved
forward since early December.  That logjam is hopefully resolved at long
last in the patches-in-queue branch:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/xfs/xfstests-dev.git/log/?h=patches-in-queue

So here's all the stuff that I was *going* to send late last year to
catch up fstests to the final versions of online fsck (6.12) and the xfs
metadata directory changes (6.13).  I'm adding the realtime rmap and
reflink changes (6.14) because we're three weeks past the merge window.

These patches are (more or less) based atop the patches in queue branch.
First come some fixes for last week's for-next push, and some gentle
reworking of the zeroout support in the log replay code that I was
working on last October.

After that is all the 6.12-6.14 stuff, and a functional test for the
rdump command that's out for review.  Apologies for the huge dump, I
was not expecting things to back up for 79 days.

You might want to just pull the branch:
