Oh, the usual problems of adding a new interface...

1. Who is responsible for setting m_sb_bp?

Should libxfs_mount attach m_sb_bp?  Should individual programs decide
to do that if they require the functionality?  Should we instead have a
xfs_getsb function that returns m_sb_bp if set, or libxfs_getbufr's a
new buffer and tries to cmpxchg it with the pointer?

What about mkfs, which needs to libxfs_mount before it's even written
anything to disk?

2. Should it be a cached buffer so that any other program (e.g. xfs_db)
doing open-coded accesses of the superblock will get the same cached
buffer, or should it be uncached like the kernel?

If we decide on uncached, this will necessitate a full audit of xfsprogs
to catch open-coded calls to libxfs_getbuf for the primary super, or
else coherency problems will result.

If we decide on using a cached buffer and setting it in libxfs_mount,
then the part of xfs_repair that tears down the buffer cache and
reinitializes it with a different hash size will also have to learn to
brelse m_sb_bp before destroying the cache and re-assign it afterwards.
Alternately, I suppose it could learn to rehash itself.

This is a /lot/ to think about to solve one problem in one program.

If you modify cache_node_get like this to make reclaim more aggressive:

diff --git a/libxfs/cache.c b/libxfs/cache.c
index 139c7c1b..b5e1bcf8 100644
--- a/libxfs/cache.c
+++ b/libxfs/cache.c
@@ -448,10 +448,10 @@ cache_node_get(
 		/*
 		 * not found, allocate a new entry
 		 */
+		priority = cache_shake(cache, priority, false);
 		node = cache_node_allocate(cache, key);
 		if (node)
 			break;
-		priority = cache_shake(cache, priority, false);
 		/*
 		 * We start at 0; if we free CACHE_SHAKE_COUNT we get
 		 * back the same priority, if not we get back priority+1.

It's trivially reproducible with xfs_repair (do not specify -n).
