I'm not sure if it has some regression since write lock will be only
taken when shrinking (shrinking is a rare operation), for most cases
which is much similiar to perag radix root I think.

The locking logic is that, when pag->pag_inactive = false -> true,
the write lock, AGF/AGI locks all have to be taken in advance.

If my understanding is correct, my own observation these months is
that the current XFS codebase is not well suitable to accept !pag
(due to many logic assumes pag structure won't go away, since some
 are indexed/passed by agno rather than some pag reference count).

Even I think we could introduce some active references, but handle
the cover range is still a big project. The current approach assumes
pag won't go away except for umounting and blocks allocation / imap/
... paths to access that.

My current thought is that we could implement it in that way as the
first step (in order to land the shrinking functionality to let
end-users benefit of this), and by the codebase evolves, it can be
transformed to a more gentle way.

Thanks,
Gao Xiang
