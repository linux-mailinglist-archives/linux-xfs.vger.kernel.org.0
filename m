Thanks Chandan - I had rolled something like this into the merge of kernel
"xfs: Use xfs_extnum_t instead of basic data types"
because it seemed like it should maybe all be done at once.

And the tree Dave has already had (some of) these type changes in db/ and
repair/dinode.c as part of that patch.

On top of that, I added a lot more of these conversions, i.e. to
bmap(), bmap_one_extent(), and make_bbmap() in db/bmap.c, 
process_bmbt_reclist() in db/check.c, fa_cfileoffd() and
fa_dfiloffd() in db/faddr.c ... perhaps I should send you my net diff
on top of the tree dchinner assembled, and you can see what you think?

But at the highest level, does it make more sense to convert everything
in the utilities at the same time as "xfs: Use xfs_extnum_t instead of
basic data types" is applied to xfsprogs libxfs/ or would separate patches
be better?

Thanks,
-Eric
