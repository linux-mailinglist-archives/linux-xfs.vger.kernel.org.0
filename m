Hm, yeah, the "reported" variable here counts the number of things the
kernel reported to us as having been checked or marked sick at some point.
The whole point of that is that if the kernel hasn't marked anything
checked or sick then we really can't say much about the state of the
filesystem and maybe the user should run xfs_scrub.
