It's a zero day bug, but at least nobody tripped over this until two
months ago.  I've been dealing on and off with customer escalations
involving a filesystem with large reflinked images that goes down, and
then some time after the recovery (minutes to weeks) they hit a
corruption goto and crash again.  I've been able to pin down the
symptoms to ... the "corrupt" refcount btree block containing partial
old contents, where the old contents are always aligned to 128 byte
boundaries, and when Dave mentioned this last night I realized that he
and I might have fallen into the same thing.

We did -- it was (is) a patchset to turn on log incompat feature bits in
the superblock, and clear them later on when they're not in use and the
log is being cleaned.  I proposed doing that for atomic file content
swapping, and Allison's deferred xattrs patchset will want the same to
protect xattr log intent items.

/me guesses that we should go with plan B for 5.14, and work on fixing
whatever's wrong for 5.15.  But since it's never possible to tell how
much time is left until the merge window opens, I'll keep an open
mind...

...at least until I hear what this simple way out is.
