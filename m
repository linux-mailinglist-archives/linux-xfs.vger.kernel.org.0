Right, it's never, ever been used, except in xfs_logprint. Prior to
delayed logging, it was defined as:

        __int32_t       th_tid;                 /* transaction id (unused) */

So it was always zero. It is still unused by anything except
logprint, in which case I noticed that it was byteswapped compared
to the op header TID, which made searches for ophdrs that matched
the transaction header TID difficult.

I've changed it back to what it was and added a note to the code to
indicate that the transaction header is in host byte order, not big
endian.

Cheers,

Dave.
