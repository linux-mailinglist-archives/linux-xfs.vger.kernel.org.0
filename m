I'd call that expected behaviour. We enforce space restrictions
(ENOSPC and EDQUOT) on the size being requested before the operation
takes place and return the unused space reservation after the
fallocate() completes and has allocated space.

We cannot overcommit space or quota in XFS - that way leads to
deadlocks and data loss at ENOSPC because we can end up in
situations where we cannot write back data that users have written.
Hence we check up front, and if the worst case space requirement for
a given operation cannot fit under the ENOSPC or EDQUOT limits, it
is rejected with EDQUOT/ENOSPC.

Yes, that means we get corner cases when near EDQUOT/ENOSPC where
stuff like this happens, but that tends to be exceedingly rare in
the rare world as few applications use the entire filesystem space
or quota allowance in just 1-2 allocations.

Yup, filesystems behave differently at edge cases.

I'd say using fallocate to extend the file like this is .... not a
very good idea. All you actually need is a ftruncate() to change the
file size after the first fallocate (or use the first fallocate to
extend the file, too). The second fallocate() is largely useless on
most filesystems - internally they turn it into an extending
truncate because no allocation is required, so you may as well just
call ftruncate() and that way you will not trip over this space
reservation issue at all..

Cheers,

Dave.
