Yes, but it also does an awful lot that we do not need.

RIght it ends up doing that because an uninitialised inode fork
(di_forkoff = 0) is the same size as the requested size of zero, and
then it does ip->i_d.di_forkoff = xfs_default_attroffset(ip) >> 3;

But that's decided another two function calls deep, after a lot of
branches and shifting and comparisons to determine that the attr
fork is empty. Yet we already know that the attr fork is empty here
so all that extra CPU work is completely unnecessary.

Keep in mind we do exactly the same thing in
xfs_bmap_forkoff_reset(). We don't care about all the setup stuff in
xfs_bmap_add_attrfork(), we just reset the attr fork offset to the
default if the attr fork had grown larger than the default offset.

It just seems wrong to me to code a special case into some function
to optimise that special case when the code that needs the special
case has no need to call that function in the first place.....

Cheers,

Dave.
