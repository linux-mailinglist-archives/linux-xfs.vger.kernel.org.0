Backing up here, I've realized that my own analysis of Dave's pseudocode
was incorrect.

On a little endian machine, we'll start with the following.  A is the
LSB of seconds; D is the MSB of seconds; E is the LSB of nsec, and H is
the MSB of nsec.

  sec  nsec (incore)
  l  m l  m
  ABCD EFGH

Now we encode that with an old kernel, which calls cpu_to_be32 to turn
that into:

  sec  nsec (ondisk)
  m  l m  l
  DCBA HGFE

Move over to a new kernel, and that becomes:

  tstamp (ondisk)
  m      l
  DCBAHGFE

Next we decode with be64_to_cpu:

  tstamp (incore)
  l      m
  EFGHABCD

Now we extract nsec from (tstamp & -1U) and sec from (tstamp >> 32):

  sec  nsec
  l  m l  m
  ABCD EFGH

So yes, masking and shifting /after/ the endian conversion works just
fine and doesn't throw any sparse/smatch errors.

Now on a big endian machine:

  sec  nsec (incore)
  m  l m  l
  DCBA HGFE

Now we encode that with an old kernel, which calls cpu_to_be32 (a nop)
to turn that into:

  sec  nsec (ondisk)
  m  l m  l
  DCBA HGFE

Move over to a new kernel, and that becomes:

  tstamp (ondisk)
  m      l
  DCBAHGFE

Next we decode with be64_to_cpu (a nop):

  tstamp (incore)
  m      l
  DCBAHGFE

Now we extract nsec from (tstamp & -1U) and sec from (tstamp >> 32):

  sec  nsec
  m  l m  l
  DCBA HGFE

Works fine here too.

Now the /truly/ nasty case here is xfs_ictimestamp, since we log the
inode core in host endian format.  If we start with this the vfs
timestamp on a new kernel:

  sec  nsec (incore)
  l  m l  m
  ABCD EFGH

We need to encode that as:

  tstamp (ondisk)
  l      m
  ABCDEFGH

The only way to do this is: (nsec << 32) | (sec & -1U).  That makes the
log timestamp encoding is the opposite of what we do for the ondisk
inodes, because log formats don't use cpu_to_be64.

At least for a big endian machine, log timestamp coding is easy:

  sec  nsec (incore)
  m  l m  l
  DCBA HGFE

We need to encode that as:

  tstamp (ondisk)
  m      l
  DCBAHGFE

And the only way to get there is (sec << 32) | (nsec & -1U), which is
what the ondisk inode timestamp coding does.

I still think this is grody, but at least now now I have a new fstest to
make sure that log recovery doesn't trip over this.  So, you were
technically right and I was wrong.  We'll see how you like the new
stuff. ;)
