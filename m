Sure, I'll run the test. I forgot to mention that in vanilla upstream kernel
I could see the difference in the number of cache flushes caused by the
XFS changes but not actual change in dbench numbers (they were still
comparable to the bad ones from my test). The XFS change made material
difference to dbench performance only together with scheduler / cpuidling /
frequency scaling fixes we have in our SLE kernel (I didn't try to pin down
which exactly - I guess I can try working around that by using performance
cpufreq governor and disabling low cstates so that I can test stock
vanilla kernels). Thanks for the patch!
