<shrug> The first three versions didn't set ATTRBIT; somewhere between
v4 and v5 Allison changed mkfs to set ATTRBIT; and as of v13 it still
does.

That said, there aren't actually any parent pointers on an empty
filesystem because the root dir is empty and the rt/quota inode are
children of the superblock.  So, technically speaking, it's not
*required* for mkfs to set it, at least not until we start adding
metadir inodes.

At no point during the development of parent pointers has xfs_repair
ever validated that ATTRBIT is set if PARENT is enabled -- it only
checks that ATTRBIT is set if any attr forks are found.

Someone who fuzzes the filesystem could turn off ATTRBIT on an empty fs.
That's a valid configuration since there are also no parent pointers.

Or at least I'm assuming it is since xfs_repair has never complained
about ATTRBIT being set on a filesystem with no attr forks, and nobody's
suggested adding that enforcement in the 6 years the parent pointer
series has been out for review.

Getting back to the story, if someone mounts that empty filesystem and
tries to create a directory structure, the fs blows up.  This patch
fixes that situation without adding more ways that mount can fail.

Patches welcome.
