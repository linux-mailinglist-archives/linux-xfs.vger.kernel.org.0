Isn't the configure script supposed to handle install locations?
Both xfsprogs and xfsdump have this in their include/builddefs.in:

PKG_ROOT_SBIN_DIR = @root_sbindir@
PKG_ROOT_LIB_DIR= @root_libdir@@libdirsuffix@

So the actual install locations are coming from the autoconf setup
the build runs under. Looking in configure.ac in xfsprogs and
xfsdump, they both do the same thing:

.....
#
# Some important tools should be installed into the root partitions.
#
# Check whether exec_prefix=/usr: and install them to /sbin in that
# case.  If the user choses a different prefix assume he just wants
# a local install for testing and not a system install.
#
case $exec_prefix:$prefix in
NONE:NONE | NONE:/usr | /usr:*)
  root_sbindir='/sbin'
  root_libdir="/${base_libdir}"
  ;;
*)
  root_sbindir="${sbindir}"
  root_libdir="${libdir}"
  ;;
esac

AC_SUBST([root_sbindir])
AC_SUBST([root_libdir])

....

I suspect that this "system install" logic - which once made sense -
doesn't work at all with symlinked /sbin setups.

IIRC debian is in a transistion stage where it will accept either
types of package, but people trying to install a "linked /sbin only"
system will be reporting issues where pacakges do the wrong thing...

So the fedora rpm package build is overriding the locations that
autoconf set in include/builddefs for the install on the make
command line?

Ok, it is.

So my question is this: what magic should we be putting in autoconf
to have it automatically detect that the package should build for a
linked /sbin and have the build always do the right thing via "make
install"?

AFAICT, yes, it does exist. The buildroot from a recent package
build:

$ ls -l xfsprogs-5.7.0-rc0/debian/xfsprogs/sbin
total 928
-rwxr-xr-x 1 dave dave   1968 May 21 15:41 fsck.xfs
-rwxr-xr-x 1 dave dave 367584 May 21 15:42 mkfs.xfs
-rwxr-xr-x 1 dave dave 573536 May 21 15:42 xfs_repair
$

xfsprogs also appears to be packaging binaries in /sbin, too.

Cheers,

Dave.
