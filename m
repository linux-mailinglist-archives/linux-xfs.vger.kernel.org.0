To be clear, my comment had no intention to serve as a condition for
merging your patch and not for suggesting that you should do anything really.
My comment was that "I was going to propose an RFC" meaning that
I was going to send patches but didn't get to it yet.
It's not a treewide project either, it's a simple optional annotation per test,
as is the case with LTP's optional .tags array.

My plan was to start with annotating the overlay tests and the xfs tests
that I collected during my work on v5.10..v.5.17 xfs backports, as they say
The change starts with me ;)

TBH, I am a bit surprised that you sign yourself up to fixing all those
other filesystems. It sounds like you got plenty on your plate already.
My intention is not to talk you out of doing community work, but to ask
what is the best way for developers that find a bug which they do NOT
intend to fix, to annotate the test for that bug.

I ran into that dilema with overlay/061 which tests for some non-standard
behavior regarding mmap that has been there since day 1 and is sufficiently
hard to fix. I ended up leaving this test out of "auto" group and in
"posix" group.
I might have left it in "known" or "broken" group just the same.

Regarding *this* patch, why not leave it _supported_fs generic?
What are the downsides?
Other fs would fail the test as they should.
It's not like that new behavior is debatable, it's a proper security issue.
And especially for fs that support FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE
and FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE, so my other suggestion if you do
not wish to inflict this new failure on all other fs is to make the test require
finsert and document in a comment why that was done.

I know that the test won't run on btrfs with this requirement, but that is not
your problem to solve and also I am quite surprised that btrfs does not
support finsert/fcollapse, so maybe that support will be added some day
and then the security thread that comes with it could be avoided.

Thanks,
Amir.
