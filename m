I though you were asking "does it work/been tested enough to merge"
to which I answered "yes". I did point out that it was a quick
forward port, so stuff like variables the wrong way around in
wrappers I had to add for the forward port shouldn't be a surprise.

I don't see that as necessary before merging it. It's the direction
these wrappers need to move in so that we get better consistency in
libxfs between user and kernel space. We don't have to do everyone
at once and make code pristine perfect before merging it. Merging
functional, working code is far better than trying to polish off
every rough edge of every patch before considering them for merge..

Nope.
