Heh, ok.

Quota timers have always treated the d_{b,i,rtb}timer value as an
unsigned 32-bit integer, which means that it has /never/ been possible
to set a timer expiration before 1/1/1970.  The quota timer range is
therefore 198,841 days *after* 1970, not after 1901.

Therefore, the quota timer range in days is:

$ echo $(( ((2**34) + (2**31)) / 86400) ))
223696

So, technically speaking, the quota timers could go beyond 2486, but the
current patchset clamps the quota counters to the same max as the
inodes.  I guess I just proved the need for more details upfront.
