Hi,
I came across chapter in XFS documentation "12.4.1 xfs_db AGI Example" 
quoting bellow:
---
recs[1-85] = [startino,freecount,free]1:[96,0,0] 2:[160,0,0] 3:[224,0,0] 
4:[288,0,0]
                                       5:[352,0,0] 6:[416,0,0] 
7:[480,0,0] 8:[544,0,0]
                                       9:[608,0,0] 10:[672,0,0] 
11:[736,0,0] 12:[800,0,0]
                                       ...
                                       85:[5792,9,0xff80000000000000]

Most of the inode chunks on this filesystem are totally full, since the 
free value is zero.
This means that we ought to expect inode 160 to be linked somewhere in 
the directory structure.
However, notice that 0xff80000000000000 in record 85 — this means that 
we would expect inode 5856
to be free. Moving on to the free inode B+tree, we see that this is 
indeed the case:
---

As there are 9 inodes free in the last chunk of 64 inodes it gives me 
first free inode 5847 (5792+55),
on the other hand inode 5856 is also free as it's last inode in the 
chunk.

My question is do I understand correctly that the first free inode in 
that AG is 5847?
Thanks, bellow possible patch.
