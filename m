This one I can answer quickly: later when we get into delayed 
attributes, this will get called from xfs_defer_finish_noroll as part of 
a .finish_item call back.  If these callbacks return anything other than 
0 or -EAGAIN, it causes a shutdown.  Which is not what we would want for 
example: when the user tries to rename a non-existent attribute.  The 
error code needs to go back up.  So we check for things like that before 
starting a delayed operation.  Hope that helps.  Thanks!

Allison
