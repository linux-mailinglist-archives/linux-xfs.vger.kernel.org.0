Actually, if the data in the buffer is bad after it has been
successfully read and we want to make sure it never gets used, the
buffer should be marked stale.

That will prevent the buffer from being placed on the LRU when it is
released, and if a lookup finds it in cache it will clear /all/ the
flags on it

xfs_da_read_buf() has read the buffer successfully, and set up it's
state so that it is cached via insertion into the LRU on release. We
want to make sure that nothing uses this buffer again without a
complete re-initialisation, and that's effectively what
xfs_buf_stale() does.

We shouldn't be trying to re-use a corrupt buffer - it should cycle
out of memory immediately. Clearing the XBF_DONE flag doesn't
accomplish that; it works for buffer read verifier failures because
that results in the buffer being released before they are configured
to be cached on the LRU by the caller...

Indeed, xfs_buf_read_map() already stales the buffer on read and
reverify failure....

Cheers,

Dave.
