Something like that, though I'd much prefer to factor the freelist
fixup calculations and use them here so we have a single set of
"is there enough space in this AG for allocating X blocks"
functions.

It's somewhat outside the scope of this patchset, so I wrote the
comment rather than trying to address it here and complicate this
patchset....

Yeah, but that was more about cleaning up the code in xfs_inode.c
by separating out the inode initialisation from the physical inode
allocation. That cleanup and separation is what allows this series
to simplify and clean up the inode allocation because it is no
longer commingled with the inode initialisation after allocation...

Yup, along with the 5.11 mods, we've chopped a lot of unnecessary
code out of the inode allocation path... :)
