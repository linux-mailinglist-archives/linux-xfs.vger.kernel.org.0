scrub silently starts discarding less than it does now.  My guess is
nobody would notice because meh and who cares? ;)

Ugh.  We can't just lie and add unsupported ranges to range.len because
(a) that's dishonest even if there's no expectation that the discards
did anything and (b) we'd have walk the freespace metadata just to lie.

OTOH generic/260 is butt-ugly with all the accounting special cases in
there.  Maybe there's a way to change the test to figure out how much
discarding is possible on an xfs filesystem so that it can handle
hetergeneous filesystems?
