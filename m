Personal preference. It makes the code clear that we are returning
just the size of this item, not blindly adding it to an external
variable.

Just another example of an API wart that is a hold over from ancient
code from before the days of delayed logging. ->iop_size is always
called with nvecs = nbytes = 0, so they only ever return the
size/vecs the item will use. The ancient code passed running count
variables to these functions, not "always initialised to zero".
varaibles. We should really clean that up across the entire
interface at some point...

Cheers,

Dave.
