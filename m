Hi Dave,

Thank you for your response.

If I understand your response correctly:
- some sunit/swidth changes during mount are legal and some aren't
- the legal changes should be persisted in the superblock

What about the repair? Even if user performs a legal change, it still
breaks the repairability of the file system.

For now, we made a local change to not persist sunit/swidth updates in
the superblock. Because we must have a working repair, and our kernel
(4.14 stable) allows any sunit/swidth changes.

We can definitely adhere to the recommended behavior of setting
sunit/swidth=1 during mkfs, provided the repair still works after
mounting with different sunit/swidth.

Thanks,
Alex.
