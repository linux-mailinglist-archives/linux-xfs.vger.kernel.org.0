You haven't looked at how check-parallel works, have you? :/

Please go and read the check-parallel script. It does all the
per-runner process test and scratch device configuration itself
using loop devices.

Sure.

Which I really don't care about.

That's something for a QE organisation to worry about, and it's up
to them to make the best use of the tools they have within the
budget they have.

Then multiple tests will fail with the same dmesg error, but it's
generally pretty clear which of the tests caused it. Yes, it's a bit
more work to isolate the specific test, but it's not hard or any
different to how a test failure is debugged now.

If you want to automate such failures, then my process is to grep
the log files for all the tests that failed with a dmesg error then
run them again using check instead of check-parallel.  Then I get
exactly which test generated the dmesg output without having to put
time into trying to work out which test triggered the failure.

Not really. Both dmesg and the results files will have tracked all
the tests inflight when the system crashes, so it's just an extra
step to extract all those tests and run them again using check
and/or check-parallel to further isolate which test caused the
failure....

I'm sure this could be automated eventually, but that's way down my
priority list right now.

Yes. This is no different to a test that is flakey or compeltely
fails when run serially by check multiple times. You still need a
human to find the root cause of the failure.

Nobody is being forced to change their tooling or processes to use
check-parallel if they don't want or need to. It is an alternative
method for running the tests within the fstests suite - if using
check meets your needs, there is no reason to use check-parallel or
even care that it exists...
