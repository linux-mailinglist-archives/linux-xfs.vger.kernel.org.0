This wasn't a problem for me when reviewing the patches.
Kernel patches were fresh in my head and I could tell when patches were
partially applied.

I think it is more of a concern for long term maintenance of xfsprogs -
having patches with obscure commit messages that do not match the
change, so it is really up to Eric and you guys as main stakeholders.

FWIW, quoting the kernel source commit sounds like a good idea.

Thanks,
Amir.
