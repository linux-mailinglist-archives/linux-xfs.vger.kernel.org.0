Which actually took me some time to find because that email just
points some other email.... :/

I think in the end, that entire discussion ended up at two things
once the behaviour of the throttle was iterated over and agreed upon
as a decent compromise. I'll summarise below in line.

Biran asked to change this to a "<" check and switch the code in the
branch and the function tail around. The code is not wrong or
inconsistent with other code, and the change doesn't result in a
reduction of code, just a different layout.

OTOH, personal taste on my side is to prefer to keep lock/unlock
pairs at the same indent level so at a glance it is obvious that
they are paired and balanced.

IOWs, this is just a question of personal taste...

Brian also asked for this note to be removed and put into the commit
message, which I had pulled out of the commit message and put into
the code because someone else requested that....

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20190916163325.GZ2229799@magnolia/

So, when personal tastes collide, the submitter has to choose
between them. When review comments conflict, the submitter has
to choose between them.

I chose not to modify the patch, and that's the long and short of
it...

Cheers,

Dave.
