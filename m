Hmm, maybe let's back up a step here.  What's the purpose of being able
to set quota_on privileges on a file?  Is it so that sysadmins can
designate a particular file as a "quota" file and thereby prevent the
kernel from being tricked into loading some other file as the quota data
file?

I ask this because AFAICT in ext4, the "usrjquota=<path>" mount options
are for the old quota system wherein quotas are files that are managed
separately from the filesystem.

The new ext4 quota system links the quota inode pointers only from the
superblock, and it calls dquot_load_quota_inode, which doesn't seem to
have a security callout.  Seeing as there's no user-visible file for new
style quotas, I don't see why you'd need a selinux hook either.

I guess it could be generally useful to be able to be able to apply the
same quota_on labels to root directories of filesystems that have new
style quotas that one can apply to quota files on fses with old style
quotas... but (a) I don't see that being the case right now, and (b) if
you're trying to /add/ that functionality then yes it ought to be in
fs/quota/... and yes xfs will have to play catch up once it's there.

Is there already a precedent for setting quota_on labels to the root
dir?  It's entirely possible that I'm simply unaware of what's going on
in fs/quota/ because xfs mostly does its own things wrt quota.
