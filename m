From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

If a dquot has an incore reservation that exceeds the ondisk count, it
by definition has active incore state and must not be reclaimed.  Up to
this point every inode with an incore dquot reservation has always
retained a reference to the dquot so it was never possible for
xfs_qm_dquot_isolate to be called on a dquot with active state and zero
refcount, but this will soon change.

Deferred inode inactivation is about to reorganize how inodes are
inactivated by shunting all that work to a background workqueue.  In
order to avoid deadlocks with the quotaoff inode scan and reduce overall
memory requirements (since inodes can spend a lot of time waiting for
inactivation), inactive inodes will drop their dquot references while
they're waiting to be inactivated.

However, inactive inodes can have delalloc extents in the data fork or
any extents in the CoW fork.  Either of these contribute to the dquot's
incore reservation being larger than the resource count (i.e. they're
the reason the dquot still has active incore state), so we cannot allow
the dquot to be reclaimed.
