Ah!  Super sorry, there should be 20 patches, not 19.  I should have 
started the format patch tool one commit earlier.

This should be the first patch:
https://github.com/allisonhenderson/xfs_work/commit/3f923b577d4a2113434e9bc79e1745ce182849d4

In fact if it helps to simply download the sets, I made some git hub links:
https://github.com/allisonhenderson/xfs_work/tree/Delayed_attr_v3
https://github.com/allisonhenderson/xfs_work/tree/Delayed_attr_xfsprog_v2
https://github.com/allisonhenderson/xfs_work/tree/Delayed_Attr_xfstests_v2

Would you prefer I resend the sets, or are the links easier?

Sorry about the confusion!
Allison
