Thinking further about this, let's elide the call if there isn't any
work to continue.

IOWs, the function shortens to:

static inline int
xfs_refcount_continue_op(
	struct xfs_btree_cur		*cur,
	xfs_fsblock_t			startblock,
	xfs_agblock_t			new_agbno,
	xfs_extlen_t			new_len,
	xfs_fsblock_t			*fsbp)
{
	struct xfs_mount		*mp = cur->bc_mp;
	struct xfs_perag		*pag = cur->bc_ag.pag;
	xfs_fsblock_t			new_fsbno;

	new_fsbno = XFS_AGB_TO_FSB(mp, pag->pag_agno, new_agbno);

	if (XFS_IS_CORRUPT(mp, !xfs_verify_fsbext(mp, new_fsbno, new_len)))
		return -EFSCORRUPTED;

	if (XFS_IS_CORRUPT(mp, pag->pag_agno != XFS_FSB_TO_AGNO(mp, new_fsbno)))
		return -EFSCORRUPTED;

	*fsbp = new_fsbno;
	return 0;
}

and the call sites now look like:

	error = xfs_refcount_adjust(rcur, bno, blockcount, &new_agbno,
			new_len, XFS_REFCOUNT_ADJUST_INCREASE);
	if (error)
		goto out_drop;
	if (*new_len > 0)
		error = xfs_refcount_continue_op(rcur, startblock,
				new_agbno, *new_len, new_fsb);
