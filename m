Right, that still has the issue that it thinks each segment is a
struct page, whereas the iomap code is putting a struct folio that
contains a contiguous multipage folio into each segment.

Yes, using bio_for_each_folio_all() is large folio aware. But then
you'll have to also pass the folio through the verification chain
for getting data offsets into the folio, etc.

Cheers,

Dave.
