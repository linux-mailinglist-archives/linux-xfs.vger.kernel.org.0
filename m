Oh, sorry, I didn't notice the words

If we'd only try to trylock AGI and release perag and relock again,
and that's fine. Sorry about the noise :)

btw, also add some other notes here. For AGI pre-commits, I'm not
quite sure if some users take another locked buffer first (but
without AGI), so it would have some potential locking order concern
as well... But let us think about them later :)

add agi to precommit
lock other buffers

precommit --- lock AGI
