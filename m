Agreed. The purpose of separate patch series' is to facilitate upstream
review and patch processing. This series strikes me as not only separate
logical changes, but changes probably with different trajectories toward
merge as well. E.g., do we expect to land this whole series together at
the same time? That would seem... unwise.

If not (or if we don't otherwise want to unnecessarily delay the earlier
parts of the series until the whole percpu cil thing at the end is
worked out), then I think it probably makes sense to split off into
three or so subseries. The first can cover the log flush optimizations
and whatever one off fixes that are all probably close to merge-worthy,
the second can cover this op header formatting rework and associated
cleanups, and the last covers all of the percpu stuff at the end. If
there's a real concern over rebase churn, there's probably no huge need
to respin the entire collection on every review cycle of one of the
earlier subseries.
