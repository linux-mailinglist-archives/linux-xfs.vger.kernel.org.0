Just to clarify: whilst I updated to 6.1 specifically to gain access to 
the non-blocking inodegc commits, there's no evidence those inodegc 
commits had anything at all to do with my issue on 6.1, and Dave's sense 
is that they probably weren't involved.

That said, those "Fixes:" commits that haven't yet made it to 6.1 look at 
least a little suspicious to my naive eye.

I might gird my loins and try 6.1 again once those further fixes are in.
