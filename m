I still think the core code should handle this.  Without that we'd need
to export the blk_flush_plug for anything that would want to poll bios
from modules, in addition to it generally being a mess.  See a proposed
patch for that below.  I'd also split the flush aspect from the poll
aspect into two patches.

Instead of this duplicate logic everywhere I'd just make bio_boll
call blk_io_schedule for the !REQ_POLLED case and simplify all the
callers.

This indentation looks awfull,î€€normal would be:

			if (dio->submit.poll_bio &&
			    (dio->submit.poll_bio->bi_opf & REQ_POLLED))

Subject: blk-mq: don't plug for synchronously polled requests

For synchronous polling to work, the bio must be issued to the driver from
the submit_bio call, otherwise ->bi_cookie won't be set.

Based on a patch from Ming Lei.
