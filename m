Hi all,

Here's a v1 (non-RFC) version of the automatic relogging functionality.
Note that the buffer relogging bits (patches 8-10) are still RFC as I've
had to hack around some things to utilize it for testing. I include them
here mostly for reference/discussion. Most of the effort from the last
rfc post has gone into testing and solidifying the functionality. This
now survives a traditional fstests regression run as well as a test run
with random buffer relogging enabled on every test/scratch device mount
that occurs throughout the fstests cycle. The quotaoff use case is
additionally tested independently by artificially delaying completion of
the quotaoff in parallel with many fsstress worker threads.

The hacks/workarounds to support the random buffer relogging enabled
fstests run are not included here because they are not associated with
core functionality, but rather are side effects of randomly relogging
arbitrary buffers, etc. I can work them into the buffer relogging
patches if desired, but I'd like to get the core functionality and use
case worked out before getting too far into the testing code. I also
know Darrick was interested in the ->iop_relog() callback for some form
of generic feedback into active dfops processing, so it might be worth
exploring that further.

Thoughts, reviews, flames appreciated.

Brian

v1:

- Rework relog reservation model.
- Drop unnecessary log ticket t_task fix.
- Use ->iop_relog() callback unconditionally.
- Rudimentary freeze handling for random buffer relogging.

rfcv5: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20200227134321.7238-1-bfoster@redhat.com/
- More fleshed out design to prevent log reservation deadlock and
  locking problems.
- Split out core patches between pre-reservation management, relog item
  state management and relog mechanism.
