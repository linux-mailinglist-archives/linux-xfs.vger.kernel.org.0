Reason: the patchset that the fix was promoted from had moved all
the pag handling out of xfs_ifree to the caller, so direct return
was, in fact, the correct behaviour in the code it originated from.

The patch applied to upstream with no errors or fuzz, and I had
completely forgotten that somewhere in the ~50 patches in the stack
before that fix had completely reworked unlink pag handling...

How did you find this? I haven't noticed any specific increase in
unmount perag accounting leaks as a result of this, so I'm curious
as to how you noticed it and isolated it to this specific bug.
