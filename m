Well, I think it's possible but my motivation was to step away from
page manipulation as much as possible with intent to not affect other
filesystems too much. I can probably add handling of this case to
fsverity_read_merkle_tree_block() but fs/verity still will create
bitmap and have a limit. The other way is basically revert changes
done in patch 09, then, it probably will be quite a mix of page/block
handling in fs/verity/verify.c

With this patch is_hash_block_verified() doesn't reset bits for
blocks belonging to the same page. Even if page is re-instantiated
only one block is checked in this case. So, when other blocks are
checked they are reset.

	if (block_cached)
		return test_bit(hblock_idx, vi->hash_block_verified);

If block was re-instantiated or was in cache. I can try to come up
with better name.
