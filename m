OK, so 20 xattrs of about 40 bytes on disk each in each file. That's
enough to put them in extent format.

Queue everything up for inodegc

And inject random xfs_bmapi_read() errors into inodegc processing.

Ok, so the error injection has caused xfs_bmapi_read() when
truncating the attr fork to return -EFSCORRUPTED, which
xfs_inactive() has completely dropped on the ground and then failed
to free the inode before marking if valid for reclaim.

The the inode freeing code has asserted that the inode is not clean
and we're freeing an inode that still references filesystem blocks.
The ASSERT() is certainly valid and should have triggered, but I
don't think that it needs fixing. I'll get to that later.

Why do we even need the lock here for this check? The inode cannot
be found by a VFS lookup, and we are in XFS_INACTIVATING state which
means internal inode looks will skip it too.  So nothing other than
the inodegc code can be referencing the inode attr fork here. So
what's the lock for?

I'd just replace this with:

	if (!xfs_inode_has_attr_fork(dp))
		return 0;

We have nothing locked here.

	if (error)
		return error;

Hmmmm. No, I don't think this is right - the existing code is doing
the right thing.

We just got an -EFSCORRUPTED from xfs_itruncate_extents(), and we
are in the process of freeing the inode. The inode is unlinked,
unrefered and corrupt, so we need to leak the blocks we cannot
access in the attr fork to be able to successfully free the inode
and continue on without shutting down the filesystem.

In this situation, we need to zap the in-memory attr fork so that
the memory associated with the extents we just decided to leak is
freed correctly and not leaked. Essentially, any error in this path
should be zapping the attr fork on error here.

I don't think this works the way you think it does.

Firstly, xfs_inodegc_queue() may try to flush the work
queue (i.e. wait for pending work to be completed) so queuing
inodegc work from an inodegc workqueue worker could deadlock the
inodegc workqueue.

Secondly, inodes with i_mode != 0  that aren't being unlinked are
also pushed through this path to remove blocks beyond EOF, etc. This
change means those inodes get permanently stuck on the inodegc queue
as they always get readded to the queue and never marked as
reclaimable.  See xfs_inode_mark_reclaimable() and
xfs_inode_needs_inactive().

Thirdly, pushing an inode that failed inactivation due to corruption
through xfs_inactive again will just result in the same corruption
error occurring again. Hence they'll also get stuck forever in the
inodegc loop.

Ah.

Yeah.

Except for your test case.

Error injection is random/transient, and you gave it a 33% chance of
injecting an error. Hence it will continue looping through
inactivation until it doesn't trigger the xfs_bmapi_read() error
injection. Because you also changed it not to trash the attr fork on
truncation error, the extent list remains present until every extent
gets freed successfully.  Hence ip->i_nblocks gets reduced to zero
before we try to free the inode and the specific failure your error
injection test tripped over goes away.

Now I understand - this fixes a transient corruption error
caused by error injection, but in doing so will break production
systems that encounter persistent corruption in inode inactivation.

---

Yes, I agree the way xfs_inactive() and inodegc handles errors and
cleanup needs improvement, but we've known this for a while now. But
this doesn't change the fact that we currently need to be able to
leak resources we can't access so we can continue to operate. It's
fine for ASSERTs to fire on debug kernels in these situations - as
developers we need to understand when these situations occur - but
that doesn't mean the behaviour they are warning about needs to be
fixed. It's just telling us that we are leaking stuff, it just
doesn't know why.

We have be waiting on having fine grained health infomration for
inodes to be able to handle situations like this more gracefully.
That code is being merged in 6.4, and it means that we know the
inode is corrupt. Hence we can tailor the debug assert to only fire
if the inode has not encountered corruption, do smarter things in
inodegc/reclaim when dealing with inodes that are corrupt, etc.

However, that doesn't mean the inactivation behaviour that triggered
the assert is wrong.  That assert ioften picks up code bugs, but a
corruption error in freeing an inode is one of the situations where
the "leak resources we can't access to free" behaviour is
intentional. That's what we want production machines to do, whilst
on debug machines we want to understand why that situation happened
and determine if there's something better we can do with it.

Hence I'd suggest looking at the inode health code in the current
linux-xfs/for-next tree and checking that the error injection you
are using marks the inode as unhealthy and work from there...

Cheers,

Dave.
