allocsize mount option controls the EOF preallocation size, which, by default is
dynamic, so, you just fixed it to a small size, and it might well be the reason
why you ended up with so many extents, as the main goal of speculative
preallocation is to try to reduce fragmentation by creating bigger extents, and
as Dave mentioned, the extra space will be removed after file is closed.
I'm not the best to explain details on speculative preallocation, but I suppose
you're seeing a closer size report from du modes due the smaller preallocated
space, even though you have more extents, the extra preallocated space is still
very small.

No, speculative preallocation is dynamically removed.

IIRC, speculative preallocated blocks can be kept around even after the file is
closed, I believe append-only files are one example of that, where the
speculative preallocated blocks will be kept after a file is closed.
But I don't have a deep knowledge on the speculative prealloc algorithm to give
more details.

But I'm pretty sure it's tied up with the file's write patterns, maybe you can
describe more how this file is written to?

That's a question more for the distribution not for the upstream project =/
unlikely somebody will remember what changed between 3.10 and 4.18 and also what
the distribution backported (or not).
