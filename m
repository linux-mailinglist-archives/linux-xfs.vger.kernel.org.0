TBH I think this ought to be fixed by changing the declaration of
xfs_attr_sf_entry.nameval to "uint8_t nameval[]" and using more modern
fugly macros like struct_sizeof() to calculate the entry sizes without
us all having to remember to subtract one from the struct size.

*endp points to the first byte after the end of the buffer, because it
is defined as (*sfp + size).  The end of the last *sfep in the sf attr
struct is supposed to coincide with the end of the buffer, so changing
this to >= is not correct.
