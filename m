Will do.

Er.... xfs/122 isn't a regression test, so it's not testing previously
broken and now fixed code.  While I sense that a few peoples'
understanding of _fixed_by_kernel_commit might be constrained to "if
this test fails, check that your kernel/*fsprogs have commit XXXXX", I
myself have started `grep _fixed_by_kernel_commit' to find bug fixes and
their related regression tests to suggest backports.

...although I wonder if perhaps we should have a second set of
_by_commit helpers that encode "not a regression test, but you might
check such-and-such commit"?
