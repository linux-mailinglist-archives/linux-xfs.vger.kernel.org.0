When a checkpoint writeback is run by log recovery, corruption
propagated from the log can result in writeback verifiers failing
and calling xfs_force_shutdown() from
xfs_buf_delwri_submit_buffers().

This results in the mount being marked as shutdown, but the log does
not get marked as shut down because:

        /*
         * If this happens during log recovery then we aren't using the runtime
         * log mechanisms yet so there's nothing to shut down.
         */
        if (!log || xlog_in_recovery(log))
                return false;

If there are other buffers that then fail (say due to detecting the
mount shutdown), they will now hang in xfs_do_force_shutdown()
waiting for the log to shut down like this:

  __schedule+0x30d/0x9e0
  schedule+0x55/0xd0
  xfs_do_force_shutdown+0x1cd/0x200
  ? init_wait_var_entry+0x50/0x50
  xfs_buf_ioend+0x47e/0x530
  __xfs_buf_submit+0xb0/0x240
  xfs_buf_delwri_submit_buffers+0xfe/0x270
  xfs_buf_delwri_submit+0x3a/0xc0
  xlog_do_recovery_pass+0x474/0x7b0
  ? do_raw_spin_unlock+0x30/0xb0
  xlog_do_log_recovery+0x91/0x140
  xlog_do_recover+0x38/0x1e0
  xlog_recover+0xdd/0x170
  xfs_log_mount+0x17e/0x2e0
  xfs_mountfs+0x457/0x930
  xfs_fs_fill_super+0x476/0x830

xlog_force_shutdown() always needs to mark the log as shut down,
regardless of whether recovery is in progress or not, so that
multiple calls to xfs_force_shutdown() during recovery don't end
up waiting for the log to be shut down like this.
