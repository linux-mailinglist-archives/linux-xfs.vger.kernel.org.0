Ok, so we open a race here at the cost of stealing more reservation than
necessary from the transaction. Seems harmless, but I would like to see
some quantification/analysis on what a 'very short race window' is in
this context. Particularly as it relates to percpu functionality. Does
the window scale with cpu count, for example? It might not matter either
way because we expect any given transaction to accommodate the ctx res,
but it would be good to understand the behavior here so we can think
about potential side effects, if any.

Similarly here, assume additional split reservation for every context
rather than checking each commit. Seems reasonable in principle, but
just from a cursory glance this doesn't cover the case of the context
expanding beyond more than two iclogs. IOW, the current logic adds
split_res if the size increase from the current transaction expands the
ctx into another iclog than before the transaction. The new logic only
seems to add split_res for the first transaction into the ctx. Also note
that len seems to be a factor in the calculation of split_res, but it's
not immediately clear to me what impact filtering the split_res
calculation as such has in that regard.

(BTW the comment above this hunk needs an update if we do end up with
some special logic here.)

Other than those bits this seems fairly sane to me.
