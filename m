Me neither.  I can see how you might design file data block checksumming
to be basically an array of u32 crc[nblocks][2].  Then if you turned on
stable folios for writeback, the folio contents can't change so you can
compute the checksum of the new data, run a transaction to set
crc[nblock][0] to the old checksum; crc[nblock][1] to the new checksum;
and only then issue the writeback bio.

But I don't think that works if you crash.  At least one of the
checksums might be right if the device doesn't tear the write, but that
gets us tangled up in the untorn block writes patches.  If the device
does not guarantee untorn writes, then you probably have to do it the
way the other checksumming fses do it -- write to a new location, then
run a transaction to store the checksum and update the file mapping.

In any case, that's still just a linear array stored in some blocks
beyond EOF, and (presumably) growing in the top of the file.  Maybe you
can even have a merkle(ish) tree to checksum the checksum leaves.  But I
don't see why the xattr stuff is needed at all in that case, but what
I'm really looking for here is this -- do you folks have some future
design involving these double-checksummed headerless remote xattr
blocks?  Or a more clever data block checksumming design than the stupid
one I just came with?

I agree... at least in the absence of any other knowledge.
