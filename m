IIRC, it wasn't so bad, there may have been a lot of conflicts, but
most of them were resolved by doing search&replace on the 5.10
code and it was also pretty clean and the compiler will catch errors
if something that needed to be replaced wasn't in a conflicting hunk.

There are other log fixes pending, which look like they fix scary bugs.
I just promoted this one to accommodate the joint 5.10/5.15 series.
Here are the fixes pending in xfs-5.10.y-4:

* 6e0d4f5c1a0f - (xfs-5.10.y-4) xfs: Enforce attr3 buffer recovery order
* 610edc215903 - xfs: logging the on disk inode LSN can make it go backwards
* da28279083ee - xfs: reset child dir '..' entry when unlinking child
* 35efb2d1e3a7 - xfs: remove dead stale buf unpin handling code
* fa7ae3691e6f - xfs: hold buffer across unpin and potential shutdown processing
* 0f6d6b3e8da3 - xfs: force the log offline when log intent item recovery fails
* 1883c074e795 - xfs: fix log intent recovery ENOSPC shutdowns when
inactivating inodes

I would be happy to get to post these.
If you have time to ACK the 5.13 selection [1], I will start testing
xfs-5.10.y-4.

Thanks!
Amir.
