I only caught this thread yesterday sorry about that...

FWIW I think it odd to have this string.  Because what does 'dax,dax=always'
mean?  dax=always is not the only way the FS can support DAX.  The default
'dax=inode' also means the FS supports DAX.  So I'm not sure this is really
even giving you what you want.

I'm confused about this talk of an installer.  If 1 FS supports DAX and the
other, say 10, do not; what happens when you install something special which
to support DAX?  But what if the user of that software uses one of the other
10 FS's?

I think it has already been mentioned that the software needs this check at run
time to be correct.

But again at run time the software needs to verify it is being asked to operate
on a FS which supports DAX.  So I don't think what you are proposing is going
to work all of the time.

I agree.  I struggled over these options and what to present when I added the
feature and I never intended to break anything.

That said, I'm not sure what exactly is broken.  Moreover, I'm concerned that
there may be more wrong here than just the lack of a 'dax' option string in the
mount.
