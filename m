Well, while some subsystems have tons of topic branches that turns into
a mess really quickly.  So what Darrick said makes the most sense in
general.  There might be occasional corner cases where you'd want to
be more fine grained, but they should be very rare.

I would expect for-next to have some amount of sanity testing.  But the
idea is indeed to have the code integrated with other kernel changes
rather sooner than later.

Using master is really confusing.

As I said earlier and Darrick also said the most usual thing is
to have one branch for $CURRELEASE fixes and one for $NEXTRELEASE
development work.  for-next is then a temporary merge of those two.
If you need $CURRELEASE changes in $NEXTRELEASE to avoid a mess, you
either rebase $NEXTRELEASE (usually earlier in the merge window) or
pull the $CURRELEASE into $NEXTRELEASE with a well-documented
merge commit message documenting why it had to be done.
