I actually very much like idea of moving any knowledge of the individual
item types out of xfs_log_recovery.c.  In reply to the patch I've
suggsted an idea how to kill the knowledge for all but the buffer and
icreate items, which should make this a little more sensible.

I actually think we should go further in one aspect - instead of having
the item type to ops mapping in a single function in xfs_log_recovery.c
we should have a table that the items can just add themselves to.

That sounds more complicated what we have right now, and even more so
with my little xlog_buf_readahead helper.  Yes, the methods will all
just call xlog_buf_readahead, but they are trivial two-liners that are
easy to understand.  Much easier than a complicated calling convention
to pass the blkno, len and buf ops back.

Again I actually like the callouts, mostly because they make it pretty
clear what is going on.  I also really like the fact that the recovery
code is close to the code actually writing the log items.
