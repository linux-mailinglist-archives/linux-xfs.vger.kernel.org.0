Great!  Very exciting, I think this chunk was probably the more complex

Yes, i try to stay on top of the announcements when i see them

Right, i try to stay in top of the latest branch, but this way makes 
sense too.  I think it's good to establish a common procedure for people 
to use so that everyone knows what to expect. Thanks for the examples!
