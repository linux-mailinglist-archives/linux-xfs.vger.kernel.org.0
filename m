Ah, thanks for explaining the issue, Peter.

OK, so what I'm really missing here is knowledge on how a modern
distro is expecting binaries to be packaged. If every distro is
having to work around the install locations the package uses by
default, then we need to fix up the default locations and behaviour
of the upstream packaging.

So, what is expected behaviour in these situations:

	- user installs directly in /usr/local/... or $HOME/...
	- user installs directly in /usr/....
	- package installed on split-usr system
	- package installed on merged-usr system

Th first two here are coded into the build via 'make install', and
the package build systems use the same install command to build the
package. It seems to me that we'd want 'make install' to behave the
same way for the last 3 cases, but I'm missing how the
build/packaging system is actually supposed to reliably detect the
differences between such split/merged systems and hence just DTRT....

Cheers,

Dave.
