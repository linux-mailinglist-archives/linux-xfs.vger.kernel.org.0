This series follows up on conversions about relogging infrastructure
and the way xfs_log_done() does two things but only one of several
callers uses both of those functions. It also pointed out that
xfs_trans_commit() never writes to the log anymore, so only
checkpoints pass a ticket to xlog_write() with this flag set and
no transaction makes multiple calls to xlog_write() calls on the
same ticket. Hence there's no real need for XLOG_TIC_INITED to track
whether a ticket has written a start record to the log anymore.

A lot of further cleanups fell out of this. Once we no longer use
XLOG_TIC_INITED to carry state inside the write loop, the logic
can be simplified in both xlog_write and xfs_log_done. xfs_log_done
can be split up, and then the call chain can be flattened because
xlog_write_done() and xlog_commit_record() are basically the same.

This then leads to cleanups writing both commit and unmount records,
and removes a heap of duplicated error handling code in the unmount
record writing path.

And in looking over all this code, I noticed a heap of stale and
unnecessary comments through the code which can be cleaned up.

Finally, to complete what started all this, the XLOG_TIC_INITED flag
is removed.

This has made it through fstests without causing any obvious
regressions, so it's time for thoughts and comments. This can also
be found at:

Note that this message appears as the first (empty) commit of the
series, as this is how I get my local hacked version of guilt to
format this cover message automatically.
