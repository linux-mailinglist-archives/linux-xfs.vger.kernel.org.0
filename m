Hi everyone,

Christoph and I have been working on getting the long-delayed metadata
directory tree patchset into mergeable shape, and I think we're now
satisfied that we've gotten the code to where we want it for 6.13.
This time around we've included a ton of cleanups and refactorings that
Dave requested during the 6.12 cycle.

The metadata directory tree sets us up for much more flexible metadata
within an XFS filesystem.  Instead of rooting inodes in the superblock
which has very limited space, we instead create a directory tree that
can contain arbitrary numbers of metadata files.

Having done that, we can now shard the realtime volume into multiple
allocation groups, much as we do with AGs for the data device.  However,
the realtime volume has a fun twist -- each rtgroup gets its own space
metadata files, and for that we need a metadata directory tree.
Note that we also implement busy free(d) extent tracking, which means
that we can do discards asynchronously.

Metadata directory trees and realtime groups also enable us to complete
the realtime modernization project, which will add reverse mapping
btrees, reflink, quota support, and zoned storage support for rt
volumes.

Finally, quota inodes now live in the metadata directory tree, which is
a pretty simple conversion.  However, we added yet another new feature,
which is that xfs will now remember the quota accounting and enforcement
state across unmounts.  You can still tweak them via mount options, but
not specifying any is no longer interpreted the same as 'noquota'.
Quotas for the realtime are now supported.

I'm only sending the kernel patches to the list for now, but please have
a look at the git tree links for xfsprogs and fstests changes.
