...but that's one character short of two full tabs, and I dislike typing
<tab><space><space><space><space><space><space><space> and having the
alignment be off by a single column.

/me takes out his paint sprayer and drowns everything in paint.

XCORRUPT_WHEN(
IF_XFS_CORRUPT(
XFS_CORRUPT_LOG(
LOG_XFS_CORRUPT(
IF_XFSCORRUPTED(
XFS_CORRUPT_IFF(
if_meta_corrupt(
if_xfs_meta_bad(moo,
		whatever) {
	grumble();
}

Ok, I'll change the whole thing to if_xfs_meta_bad(test) and hopes this
is the end of bikeshedding because changing this series is a pita.
