Eek.

Why don't we set end_daddr unconditionally, then?

Hmm, looking at the end_daddr usage in fsmap.c, I think it's wrong.  If
end_daddr is set at all, it's set either to the last sector for which
the user wants a mapping; or it's set to the last sector for the device.
But then look at how we use it:

	if (info->last...)
		frec->start_daddr = info->end_daddr;

	...

	/* "report the gap..."
	if (frec->start_daddr > info->next_daddr) {
		fmr.fmr_length = frec->start_daddr - info->next_daddr;
	}

This is wrong -- we're using start_daddr to compute the distance from
the last mapping that we output up to the end of the range that we want.
The "end of the range" is modeled with a phony rmap record that starts
at the first fsblock after that range.

IOWs, that assignment should have been
frec->start_daddr = info->end_daddr + 1.

Granted in August the codebase was less clear about the difference
between rec_daddr and rmap->rm_startblock.  For 6.13, hch cleaned all
that up -- rec_daddr is now called start_daddr and the fsmap code passes
rmap records with space numbers in units of daddrs via a new struct
xfs_fsmap_rec.  Unfortunately, that's all buried in the giant pile of
pull requests I sent a couple of days ago which hasn't shown up on
for-next yet.

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/173084396955.1871025.18156568347365549855.stgit@frogsfrogsfrogs/

So I think I know how to fix this against the 6.13 codebase, but I'm
going to take a slightly different approach than yours...

...because running against djwong-wtf, I actually see the same symptoms
for the realtime device.  So I think a better solution is to change
xfs_getfsmap to set end_daddr always, and then fix the off by one error.

I also don't really like "sentinel" values because they're not
intuitive.

I will also go update xfs/273 to check that there are no gaps in the
mappings returned, and that they go to where the filesystem thinks is
the end of the device.  Thanks for reporting this, sorry I was too busy
trying to get metadir/rtgroups done to look at this until now. :(
