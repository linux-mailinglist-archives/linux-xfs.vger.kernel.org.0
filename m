They don't. That's the point I'm trying to make - these patches
don't actually fix any problems with large data fork extent counts -
they just allow them to get bigger.

As I said earlier - the primary driver for these changes is not
growing the number of data extents or reflink - it's growing the
amount of data we can store in the attribute fork. We need to grow
that from 2^16 extents to 2^32 extents because we want to be able to
store hundreds of millions of xattrs per file for internal
filesystem purposes.

Extending the data fork to 2^48 extents at the same time just makes
sense from an on-disk format perspective, not because the current
code can scale effectively to 2^32 extents, but because we're
already changing all that code to support a different attr fork
extent size. We will probably need >2^32 extents in the next decade,
so we're making the change now while we are touching the code....

There are future mods planned that will make large extent counts
bearable, but we don't have any idea how to solve problems like
making reflink go from O(n) to O(log n) to make reflink of
billion extent files an every day occurrence....

Cheers,

Dave.
