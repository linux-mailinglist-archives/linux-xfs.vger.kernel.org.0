To trigger the original bug, the post-shutdown fsync needs to be run
on the original file. That triggers a writeback error writeback
which clears the uptodate state on the mapped page. The mwrite that
follows then trips over the state of the page and attempts IO
operations without first checking shutdown state.

Hence moving the fsync to a different file will break the mechanism
the regression test uses to trigger the original bug.

It reproduced on 5.10, but not because of the reasons you are
suggesting.

It is not closed, but it's also not the target of subsequent file
operations until you use "file 0" to switch back to it....

Yup, and that's what will break the regression test.

But why does it still fail on v5.10.109?

Well, that's because of a quirk of the xfs_io fsync command.  It
doesn't have the CMD_FLAG_ONESHOT flag set on it, so it operates on
*all open files*, not just the current file.

IOWs, the misunderstanding of how the bug is triggered has been
covered up by the misunderstanding of how the xfs_io open file table
and the fsync command interact.

Do not change it to syncfs - that executes completely different
writeback and metadata sync code paths with different error
propagation and may well result in very different behaviour from the
underlying filesystem.  Fundamentally, syncfs() and fsync() are not
interchangeable from a regression test POV - you *might* get the
same high level result, but the low level code behaves very
differently...

Cheers,

Dave.
