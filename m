Ok. I suppose in the scenario where xfs_repair runs on behalf of
xfs_admin and then fails immediately due to a usage error, it might be
more appropriate to dump whatever error xfs_repair exits with. I'm not
sure how best to filter that and/or deal with the issues Darrick points
out, but fair point...

Maybe a simple compromise is a verbose option for xfs_admin itself..?
I.e., the normal use case operates as it does now, but the failure case
would print something like:

  "Feature conversion failed. Retry with -v for detailed error output."

... and then 'xfs_admin -v ...' would just pass through xfs_repair
output. Eh?
