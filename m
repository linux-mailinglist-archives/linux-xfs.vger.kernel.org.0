Yes. See:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20200807024211.GG2114@dread.disaster.area/T/#maf3bd9325fb3ac0773089ca58609a2cea0386ddf

It's a race between the readahead io completion marking pages
uptodate and unlocking them, and the io_uring worker function
getting woken on the first page being unlocked and running the
buffered read before the entire readahead IO completion has unlocked
all the pages in the IO.

Basically, io_uring is re-running the IOCB_NOWAIT|IOCB_WAITQ IO when
there are still pages locked under IO. This will happen much more
frequently the larger the buffered read (these are only 64kB) and
the readahead windows are opened.

Essentially, the io_uring buffered read needs to wait until _all_
pages in the IO are marked up to date and unlocked, not just the
first one. And not just the last one, either - readahead can be
broken into multiple bios (because it spans extents) and there is no
guarantee of order of completion of the readahead bios given by the
readahead code....

Cheers,

Dave.
