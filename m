xmalloc is local to xfs_db (db/malloc.c), it's not part of libxfs.
It's local to xfs_db because it is the tool that always runs out of
memory on large filesystems. It's just a wrapper that prints "out of
memory" and then exits immediately with no chance to recover.  So,
essentially, it's no different to immediately SEGV on a NULL pointer
and dying.

In general, that's because we can't do anything useful to free
memory when we fail memory allocation - we generally exit
immediately on memory allocation failure, so checking for failure is
almost redundant....

Cheers,

Dave.
