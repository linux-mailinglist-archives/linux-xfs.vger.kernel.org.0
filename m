No idea. I haven't done an audit, and that's outside the scope of
what I'm doing here...

I've just mirrored all the other kernel wrapper headers by placing
them in include/. I don't see much point in moving these to libfrog,
because they have no actual built object code that needs to be
linked. i.e. they are included globally for everything via
libxfs/libxfs_priv.h and include/libxfs.h, and that's all that is
needed to use these APIs. If they get more complex and require
actual object files to be built, then it's time to reconsider...

Cheers,

Dave.
