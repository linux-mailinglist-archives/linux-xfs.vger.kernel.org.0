Well, you can try, but it will be less efficient and more fragile.  It'll
probably also be very had to make it not deadlock.

Is moving heavily shared blocks first actually a good idea?  It is a
lot more work to move them and generates more metadata vs moving unshared
blocks.  That being said it at least handles reflinks, which this currently
doesn't.  I'll take a look at it for ideas on implementing shared block
support for the GC code.

As said above I'm not sold on doing the work in userspace.  But adding
config nobs to start GC earlier is on Hans' TODO list, and being able
to force it also sounds useful for some use case.  I also suspect that
reusing some of this code, but driving it from the bmap btree instead
of the rmap one could be really nice for file mapping defragmentation.

Yes, but remember blocks can't be reused in a zoned file systems until
the zone has been reset.  And xfs_reset_zones forces a flush on the
RT device before starting the current patch of resets, and then also
forces the log out so that all transactions that touched the rmap inode
(which includes the EFI transaction) are forced to disk.

They are an enum in disguise (sounds like a great country song, to go

Yes.  m_max_open_zones is the maximum number of zones we can write to
at the same time.  From that XFS_OPEN_GC_ZONES is deducted because GC
zones (there's only 1 right now) always use reserved blocks.

They could.  OTOH returning all this on a rtrmap query is more than just
a corrupted file system, isn't it?

Looks like that is used in a few places and would be nice to have
in kernel.h.

Probably because I stupidly copy and pasted this from somewhere and
it didn't blow up? :)

Instantly reclaims is when the zone is used less than 1% and we just take
it instead of looking for the best candidate (least used blocks)
otherwise.

Exactly.

Sure.  And maybe we can also work on the naming to throw in more
consistent victim and target prefixes.

Yes, it allocates blocks from the gc zones.  I.e this is the GC
counterpart of xfs_zone_alloc_blocks.  Maybe xfs_zone_gc_alloc_blocks
might be a better name?

We do have it, and as far as I can tell it's pretty useless.  Retryable
errors are already retried by the device or drive, so once things bubble
up to the file system they tend to be fatal.  So the only thing we do
with retrying here is to delay the inevitable trouble.

I'm actually looking into something related at the moment:  for writes
XFS currently bubbles up write errors to the caller (dio) or stores
them in the mapping (buffered I/O), which for the latter means we lose
the pagecache because the dirty bits are cleared, but only users that
actually fsync or close will ever see it.  And with modern media you
will only get these errors if shit really hit the fan.  For normal
1 device XFS configurations we'll hit a metadata write error sooner
or later and shut the file system down, but with an external RT device
we don't and basically never shut down which is rather problematic.
So I'm tempted to add code to (at least optionally) shut down after
data write errors.

We could.  But it will just fail again and we'll delay the failure
reporting to the upper layer which would much rather know about that and
say move it's data to a different node.

No, that's why xfs_zoned_end_io has the special mode where the old
startblock is passed in by GC, and it won't remap when they mismatch.
xfs_zoned_end_extent has a comment describing it.

I actually split it out recently so that we don't need a forward
declaration for xfs_zone_gc_data in xfs_zone_priv.h that was needed
previously and which is a bit ugly.  I also conceptually is part of
GC, as it finishes off a GC process interrupted by a powerfail.

I can look into that.

Yes, I'll add something.

Hmm.  I guess I can move it to the caller, although passing both the
data and iter will make it a bit complicated.

No zones involved at all at this level of code.  We're before
taking iolock and just reserving space.  But
!xfs_group_marked(mp, XG_TYPE_RTG, XFS_RTG_RECLAIMABLE) means there
literally isn't any reclaimable space left, and !xfs_is_in_gc means
there's also no more ongoing processes that might have taken the last
zone from reclaimable space, but haven't added it to the available
pool yet. I.e. this is the hard ENOSPC condition.
