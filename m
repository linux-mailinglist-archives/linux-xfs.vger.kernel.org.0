I've had a chance to poke at this a bit and so far I don't think it's as
straightforward as I'd hoped. The logformat command already exists,
which makes it pretty easy to malformat a log record, but the recovery
code only runs into this path on a dirty log. I suspect the original
issue that prompted this logic was something like a crash-recovery test
leading to log record trimming (i.e. simulated torn log writes) and then
happening onto previously mkfs-formatted log records that way, but that
is a guess at this point.

I did play around a bit with fuzzing h_size for those sorts of tests
(i.e. xfs/141), but that ran into other issues. I went back to using
xfsprogs v4.3 or so and that eventually also produces an unmountable
filesystem with a similar error (even with the h_size fix patch). It
fails to locate the head/tail, which is obviously necessary in order to
process the log and perform record validation, so I'm wondering if
something else changed on the kernel side to further gate this scenario.
Of course it's also possible I'm looking at things wrong and this is
just orthogonal to the original problem.

But given all of that, I am a little skeptical on the value of retaining
this logic at all. Does whatever test case that recently uncovered the
h_size problem leave a mountable filesystem, or does it just work around
bad behavior to provide a more graceful failure condition?
