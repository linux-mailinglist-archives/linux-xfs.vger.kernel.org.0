What the changes in 5.9 will do is remove the direct memory reclaim
latency that comes from waiting on IO in the shrinker. Hence you
will no longer see this problem from applications doing memory
allocation. i.e. they'll get some other memory reclaimed without
blocking (e.g. page cache or clean inodes) and so the specific
symptom of having large numbers of dirty inodes in memory that you
are seeing will go away.

Which means that dirty inodes in memory will continue to build up
until the next constraint is hit, and then it will go back to having
unpredictable large latencies while waiting for inodes to be written
back to free up whatever resource the filesystem has run out of.

That resource will, most likely, be filesystem journal space. Every
fs modification needs to reserve sufficient journal to complete
before the modification starts. Hence if the journal fills, any
modification to the fs will block waiting on dirty inode writeback
to release space in the journal....

You might be lucky and the backup process is slow enough that the
disk subsystem can keep up with the rate of ingest of new data and
so you never hit this limitation. However, the reported state of the
machine and the amount of RAM it has for caching says to me that the
underlying problem is that ingest is far faster than the filesystem
and disk subsystem can sink...

A solution to this problem might be to spread out the backups being
done over a wider timeframe, such that there isn't a sustained heavy
load at 3am in the morning when every machine is scheduled to be
backed up at the same time...

Not unless you like testing -rc1 kernels in production :)

Cheers,
