It came with a noticeable (~2%) slowdown on a swapext-heavy fsstress
run, which was my motivation for this (somewhat clunky) system for
avoiding all that overhead except for recovery.

Hmm.  Actually now that I think harder about it, the bmap item is
completely incore and fields are selectively copied to the log item.
This means that regular IO could set bi_owner = <some inode number> and
bi_ip = <the incore inode>.  Recovery IO can set bi_owner but leave
bi_ip NULL, and then the bmap item replay can iget as needed.  Now we
don't need this freeze/thaw thing at all.
