I think this is incorrect. A metadata write that is set to retry
forever and is failing because of a bad sector or some other
persistent device error will not shut down the filesystem, but still
be reported here as a failure. Hence we can easily get here without
a filesystem shutdown having occurred...

Cheers,

Dave.
