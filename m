I'd rather leave it as a btree primitive, honestly.

That said, "Is this cursor pointing to the last block on $level?" only
makes sense if you've already performed a lookup (or seek) operation.
If you've done that, you've already checked the block, right?  So I
think we could just get rid of the _check_block call on the grounds that
we already did that as part of the lookup (or turn it into an ASSERT),
and then this becomes a short enough function to try to make it a four
line static inline predicate.

Same result, but slightly better encapsulation.

(Yeah yeah, it's C, we're all one big happy family of bits...)
