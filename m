Btw, I wonder if it's time to decouple the zone size from the chunk
size eventually.  It seems like a nice little hack, but with things
like parity raid for zoned devices now showing up at least in academia,
and nvme devices reporting chunk sizes the overload might not be that
good any more.

How would atomic writes make sense for zone devices?  Because all writes
up to the reported write pointer must be valid, there usual checks for
partial updates a lacking, so the only use would be to figure out if a
write got truncated.  At least for file systems we detects this using the
fs metadata that must be written on I/O completion anyway, so the only
user would be an application with some sort of speculative writes that
can't detect partial writes. Which sounds rather fringe and dangerous.

Now we should be able to implement the software atomic writes pretty
easily for zoned XFS, and funnily they might actually be slightly faster
than normal writes due to the transaction batching.  Now that we're
getting reasonable test coverage we should be able to give it a spin, but
I have a few too many things on my plate at the moment.
