generic/642 producded this splat:

 XFS: Assertion failed: !list_empty(&cil->xc_cil), file: fs/xfs/xfs_log_cil.c, line: 1274
 ------------[ cut here ]------------
 kernel BUG at fs/xfs/xfs_message.c:102!
 invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP
 CPU: 1 PID: 2187772 Comm: fsstress Not tainted 5.18.0-rc2-dgc+ #1108

Which implies a dirty transaction with nothing in it at the end of
a run through xfs_attr_set_iter() without LARP enabled. It raced
with a CIL push, so when the empty dirty transaction tries to push
the CIL, it assert fails because the CIL is empty....

I don't know how this happens yet, but there are no intents involved
here so it doesn't appear to have anything to do with intent logging
or intent whiteouts at this point.

I'll need to reproduce it to get more info about it...

Cheers,

Dave.
