True.  I think we just need to clear cycled_icloglock in the
shutdown branch.  I prefer that flow over falling through to the
main loop body as that clearly separates out the shutdown case.

I actually very much disagree with that, and this series moves into
the other direction.  We only really changes the states when
writing to iclogs, syncing them to disk, and I/O completion.  And
all the paths just error out at a high level when the log is shut
down, so there is no need to move the state along.  Faking state
changes when they don't correspond to the actual I/O just seems like
a really bad idea.

Also if you look at what state checks are left, the are all (except
for the debug check in xfs_log_unmount_verify_iclog) under
l_icloglock and guarded by a shutdown check.
