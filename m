I recall we tried that and run into KConfig recursive dependency hell as
"config STACKDEPOT" does "select STACKTRACE", and after some attempts
ended up with the above.

It seemed rather harmless as it was just a bit of extra code. But it's
true Geert reports [1] unexpected memory usage which I would have only
expected if actual stacks started to be collected. So I guess we'll have
to look into that.
