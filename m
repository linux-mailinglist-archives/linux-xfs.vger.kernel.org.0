Hmm, both you and Bill are right; maybe I don't want to have a
three-sentence paragraph where the first sentence constitutes 60% of the
words in that paragraph. :)

"Directories and extended attributes share the function of mapping names
to information, but the differences in the functionality requirements
applied to each type of structure influence their respective internal
formats.  Directories map variable length names to iterable directory
entry records (dirent records), whereas extended attributes map variable
length names to non-iterable attribute records.  Both structures can
take advantage of variable length record btree structures (i.e the
dabtree) to map name hashes, but there are major differences in the way
each type of structure integrate the dabtree index within the
information being stored.  The directory dabtree leaf nodes contain
mappings between a name hash and the location of a dirent record inside
the directory entry segment.  Extended attributes, on the other hand,
store attribute records directly in the leaf nodes of the dabtree."

How about that instead?
