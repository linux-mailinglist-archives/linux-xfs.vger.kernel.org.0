60% of fstests is written in bash, all of it is a friggin land mine
because bash totally lets us do variable substitution at any time, and
any time you make a change you have to exhaustively test the whole mess
to make sure nothing broke...

(Yeah, I hate bash)

We do?  Can you point me to the sentence in doc/ that says this
explicitly?  There's nothing I can find in the any docs and
_try_scratch_mount does not check SCRATCH_DEV is a bdev for XFS.
That needs to be documented.

Because _xfs_verify_metadumps came long after xfs/336.  336 itself was
merged long ago when I was naïve and didn't think it would take quite so
long to merge the rtrmap code.

Some would say that mount adding the ability to set up a loop dev was
itself *avoiding* a landmine from 90s era util-linux.

Yeah, it'll get cleaned up for the rtrmap fstests merge.

Ok.
