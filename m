The cursor is dynamically allocated, yes? So what we need to do is
drop the idea that the btree is a fixed size and base it's size on
the actual number of levels iwe calculated for that the btree it is
being allocated for, right?

We already do that. XFS_BTREE_MAXLEVELS is supposed to only be for
per-AG btrees.  It is not used for BMBTs at all, they use
mp->m_bm_maxlevels[] which have max height calculations done at
mount time.

The problem is the cursor, because right now max mp->m_bm_maxlevels
fits within the XFS_BTREE_MAXLEVELS limit for the per-AG trees as
well, because everything is limited to less than 2^32 records...

Yeah, this, along with dynamic sizing of the rmapbt based
on the physical AG size when refcount is enabled...

And then we just don't have to care about the 1kB block size case at
all....

Cheers,

Dave.
