The small log case is not really what I'm wondering about. Does this
behavior translate to a similar test with a maximum sized log?

That speaks to the rarity of the throttle, which is good. But I'm
wondering, for example, what might happen on systems where we could have
hundreds of physical CPUs committing to the CIL, we block them all on
the throttle and then wake them all at once. IOW, can we potentially
create the contention conditions you reproduce above in scenarios where
they might not have existed before?
