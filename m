Ok, I'll try to keep things cleaner when I rebase against v10.  TBH I
had decided that the ioctl changes were something I could put off until
after I'd written repair, so that's why they landed where they did.
For future reference, if there's a patchset of mine that you want to
merge and want me to reorder it to make your life easier, I'm open to
doing that.

Last week I got bogged down in 6.3 problems, and then discovered that my
new name-value xattr lookup code didn't quite work right with log
recovery, so it's only today that I (think) I'm ready to call my own
work on parent pointers done.

(I'm definitely going to have to figure out how to grind out all the
sha512 stuff that was in the v9r2d1 deluge.)
