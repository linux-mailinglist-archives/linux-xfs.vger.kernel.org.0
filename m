Maybe a comment here to point out that we're retrying the allocation
with the minimum acceptable minlen?  I say this mostly because (some of)
the other clauses have a quick description of the constraints that are
being fed to the allocation request, and it makes it easier to keep
track of what's going on.

Particularly when we get here and I have to look pretty closely to
figure out what this retry is now attempting to do.  This one is trying
the allocation again, but now with no alignment and the caller's minlen,
right?
