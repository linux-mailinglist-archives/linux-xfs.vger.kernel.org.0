Heh, I can't really tell what the intended/expected behavior is. For
whatever it's worth, it seems reasonable enough to me to change it based
on the fact that project quotas have been expected to return -ENOSPC in
at least some common cases for many years. It seems unlikely that users
would know or care about the change in behavior in the subset noted
above, but who knows. It might be good to get some other opinions. :P
