No S-o-B on the patch so I was hesitant to reply, but since Brian did,
I'll reply to that.  This message brought to you by the letters Z, F,
and S.

This would open a huge security hole because users can use it to bypass
directory access checks.

Let's say I have a file /home/djwong/bin/pwnme that can be read or
written by the evil bitcom miner in my open Firefox process.  (Hey,
browsers can flash USB device firmware now, ~/bin is the least of my
problems!)

Then let's say the BOFH decides I'm too much of a security risk and
issues:

$ sudo chmod 0000 /home/djwong/bin; sudo chown root:root /home/djwong/bin

(Our overworked BOFH forgot -r and only changed ~/bin.)

Now I cannot access pwnme anymore, because I've been cut off from ~/bin.

With the below patch applied I can now bypass that restriction because I
still own ~/bin/pwnme and therefore can (now) open it by file handle.

We /could/ relax the check so that the caller only has to have one of
CAP_{SYS_ADMIN,DAC_READ_SEARCH,DAC_OVERRIDE} and let the sysadmin decide
if they want to bless xfsrestore with any of those capabilities...
