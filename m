So do I, and when I proposed it back in 2018[1], Dave indicated that we
ought to get to the point where we don't need to xfs_check as a
cross-check for xfs_repair.  I'm working on fixing up the smaller things
that repair doesn't catch, so once that series lands maybe we can just
drop xfs_check?

(Since the only big discrepancy at that point will be the lack of quota
checking...)
