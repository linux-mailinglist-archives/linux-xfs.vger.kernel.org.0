This should be fine.  The ZNS zone capacity features where zones have
a size (LBA space allocated to it) and a capacity (LBAs that can
actually be written to) is the hardware equivalent of this.

It also is an important part of garbage collection for zoned XFS, where
we'll use it on RTGs.

Btw, if we touch all of this anyway I'd drop the agno argument.
We can get the group number from the group struct (see my perag xarray
conversion series for an example where I'm doing this for the tagged
iteration).

Very messy.  I can live with a minimum of 256 MB, but no byte less :)
This is the size used by all shipping SMR hard drivers.  For ZNS SSDs
there are samples with very small zones size that are basically open
channel devices in disguise - no sane person would want them and they
don't make sense to support in XFS as they require extensive erasure
encoding and error correction.  The ZNS drives with full data integrity
support have zone sizes and capacities way over 1GB and growing.

I thought about it, but it creates real accounting nightmares.  It's
not entirely doable, but really messy.
