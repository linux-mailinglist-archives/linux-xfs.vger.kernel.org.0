Hi Dave,

As the build log shows, that's not technically accurate. You can find
logs of test builds for various architecture combinations at
http://crossqa.debian.net/src/xfsprogs. This is also available as a link
called "cross" in https://tracker.debian.org/xfsprogs.

The relevant part is:
|     [TEST]    CRC32
| In file included from crc32.c:35:
| ../include/platform_defs.h:27:10: fatal error: urcu.h: No such file or directory
|    27 | #include <urcu.h>
|       |          ^~~~~~~~
| compilation terminated.

I failed to figure a good way of dropping either include directive.

I fully agree with this in principle. However, when I fail to find that
upstreamable solution, I try to at least provide a Debian-specific
solution to iterate from.

Can you propose a way to drop either #include?

Helmut
