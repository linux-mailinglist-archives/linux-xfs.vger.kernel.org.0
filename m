At last year at plumbers there were many people who could not get
tickets, it has been full the last few years, I think.

IMHO LPC is about at the size now where it is almost as large as it
can be in a mid-sized hotel setting..

LPC does a great job at making miniconfs 'easy' - really fantastic
actually. I really appreciate how great a job they do on getting video
out and trying hard to mic everything so the freewheeling discussions
are audible to everyone.

Maybe something to think about is to keep the LSFMMBPF time slot but
instead of building a conference from scratch, copy LPC - same venue,
contracts, format, etc, etc. Ie two LPC style conferences a year, but
without having to plan two completely different sites from scratch.

IIRC when LPC was in Vancouver the LF used the same venue for several
conferences, I wonder how that worked out?
