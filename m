ifp->if_flags is set to XFS_IFINLINE for local format forks,
XFS_IFEXTENTS for extent format forks, and XFS_IFBROOT for btree
roots in the inode fork.

THe contents of the fork are mode definitely defined by the flags
in the fork structure.

The problem is that we've overloaded XFS_IFEXTENTS to -also- mean
"extents loaded in memory". The in-core extent tree used to be a
IFBROOT only feature - XFS_IFEXTENTS format forks
held the extent data in the inode fork itself, not in the incore
extent tree, and so always had direct access to the extent records.
It never needed another flag to mean "extents have been read into
memory", because they always were present in the inode fork when
XFS_IFEXTENTS was set. 

What we used to have is another flag - XFS_IFEXTIREC - to indicate
that the XFS_IFBROOT format root was read into the incore memory
tree. This was removed in commit 6bdcf26ade88 ("xfs: use a b+tree
for the in-core extent list") when the btree was added for both
extent format and btree format forks, and it's use to indicate that
the btree had been read was replaced with the XFS_IFEXTENTS flag.

That's when XFS_IFEXTENTS gained it's dual meaning.

IOWS:

- XFS_IFINLINE means inode fork data is inode type specific data
- XFS_IFEXTENTS means the inode fork data is in extent format and
  that the in-core extent btree has been populated
- XFS_IFBROOT means the inode fork data is a btree root
- XFS_IFBROOT|XFS_IFEXTENTS mean the inode data fork is a btree root
  and that the in-core extent btree has been populated

Historically, that last case was XFS_IFBROOT|XFS_IFEXTIREC. What
should have been done in 6bdcf26ade88 is the XFS_IFEXTENTS format
fork should have become XFS_IFEXTENTS|XFS_IFEXTIREC to indicate
"extent format, extent tree populated", rather than eliding
XFS_IFEXTIREC and redefining XFS_IFEXTENTS to mean "extent tree
populated".  i.e. the separate flag to indicate the difference
between fork format and in-memory state should have been
retained....

That's an implementation detail arising from always reading the
extent list from the on-disk inode fork into in-memory extent list.

Yes, that's an implementation detail - we currently do not allow an
inode in extent form to be read in without populating the in-core
extent btree, whether we need to read extents or not. Hence the
confusion over "I know btree format uses this to indicate the extent
tree has been read" vs "this always needs to be set when in extent
format". That's the logic landmine I tripped over here.

Realistically, we should be separating the in-memory extent tree
initialisation from inode fork initialisation because directory traversal
workloads that just to look at inode state does not need to populate
the extent btree. Doing so for every inode is wasted memory and
CPU. We should init the extent btree on the first operation that
needs the extent list, like we do for btrees, and for that we need
XFS_IFEXTIREC to be re-introduced to clearly separate the in-memory
fork format from the extent tree state.

If you take into account the history of this code, you can see that
XFS_IFEXTIREC -> XFS_IFEXTENTS did, indeed, give XFS_IFEXTENTS two
meanings...

What I've written is mostly correct, yet what you've written is
also mostly correct. So what do you want me to put in the commit
message?

Cheers,

Dave.
