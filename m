--- Comment #6 from Cameron Simpson (cs@cskk.id.au) ---
Sorry for the delay, been asleep.

Alas, the filesystem has been repaired and I didn't keep a log, or alas, a
transcript.

The xfs_repair is from xfsprogs 5.7.0.

By contrast, the filesystem is made by quite an old kernel:

Linux octopus 3.16.0-7-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.16.59-1 (2018-10-03) x86_64
GNU/Linux

and I have seen this filenames-with-a-leading-slash in a previous repair of an
XFS filesystem from this machine.

This bug report is really about the messaging, not the bogus filenames; I
accept that the kernel is old and the XFS implementation therefore many
bugfixes behind.

For added fun the FS is on an iscsi device from a QNAP NAS (because QNAPs don't
do XFS); I started the repair after getting link errors on the FS, after a
building wide power out took out the machine and the NAS; and we had to reseat
a drive in the raidset. It's just backups, but it has 5TB of highly linked
files in it.

Just FYI, BTW, a second run of xfs_repair after the big repair corrected a few
hardlink counts (but a mere handful, maybe 4, after the previous repair did
thousands of fixes).
