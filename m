+.TH IOCTL-XFS-EXCHANGE-RANGE 2  2023-05-08 "XFS"
+.SH NAME
+ioctl_xfs_exchange_range \- exchange the contents of parts of two files
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.br
+.B #include <sys/ioctl.h>
+.br
+.B #include <xfs/xfs_fs_staging.h>
+.PP
+.BI "int ioctl(int " file2_fd ", XFS_IOC_EXCHANGE_RANGE, struct xfs_exch_range *" arg );
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+Given a range of bytes in a first file
+.B file1_fd
+and a second range of bytes in a second file
+.BR file2_fd ,
+this
+.BR ioctl (2)
+exchanges the contents of the two ranges.
+.PP
+Exchanges are atomic with regards to concurrent file operations, so no
+userspace-level locks need to be taken to obtain consistent results.
+Implementations must guarantee that readers see either the old contents or the
+new contents in their entirety, even if the system fails.
+.PP
+The exchange parameters are conveyed in a structure of the following form:
+.PP
+.in +4n
+.EX
+struct xfs_exch_range {
+    __s64    file1_fd;
+    __s64    file1_offset;
+    __s64    file2_offset;
+    __s64    length;
+
+    __u64    flags;
+
+    __s64    file2_ino;
+    __s64    file2_mtime;
+    __s64    file2_ctime;
+    __s32    file2_mtime_nsec;
+    __s32    file2_ctime_nsec;
+
+    __u64    pad[6];
+};
+.EE
+.in
+.PP
+The field
+.I pad
+must be zero.
+.PP
+The fields
+.IR file1_fd ", " file1_offset ", and " length
+define the first range of bytes to be exchanged.
+.PP
+The fields
+.IR file2_fd ", " file2_offset ", and " length
+define the second range of bytes to be exchanged.
+.PP
+Both files must be from the same filesystem mount.
+If the two file descriptors represent the same file, the byte ranges must not
+overlap.
+Most disk-based filesystems require that the starts of both ranges must be
+aligned to the file block size.
+If this is the case, the ends of the ranges must also be so aligned unless the
+.B XFS_EXCH_RANGE_TO_EOF
+flag is set.
+
+.PP
+The field
+.I flags
+control the behavior of the exchange operation.
+.RS 0.4i
+.TP
+.B XFS_EXCH_RANGE_FILE2_FRESH
+Check the freshness of
+.I file2_fd
+after locking the file but before exchanging the contents.
+The supplied
+.IR file2_ino " field"
+must match file2's inode number, and the supplied
+.IR file2_mtime ", " file2_mtime_nsec ", " file2_ctime ", and " file2_ctime_nsec
+fields must match the modification time and change time of file2.
+If they do not match,
+.B EBUSY
+will be returned.
+.TP
+.B XFS_EXCH_RANGE_TO_EOF
+Ignore the
+.I length
+parameter.
+All bytes in
+.I file1_fd
+from
+.I file1_offset
+to EOF are moved to
+.IR file2_fd ,
+and file2's size is set to
+.RI ( file2_offset "+(" file1_length - file1_offset )).
+Meanwhile, all bytes in file2 from
+.I file2_offset
+to EOF are moved to file1 and file1's size is set to
+.RI ( file1_offset "+(" file2_length - file2_offset )).
+This option is not compatible with
+.BR XFS_EXCH_RANGE_FULL_FILES .
+.TP
+.B XFS_EXCH_RANGE_FSYNC
+Ensure that all modified in-core data in both file ranges and all metadata
+updates pertaining to the exchange operation are flushed to persistent storage
+before the call returns.
+Opening either file descriptor with
+.BR O_SYNC " or " O_DSYNC
+will have the same effect.
+.TP
+.B XFS_EXCH_RANGE_FILE1_WRITTEN
+Only exchange sub-ranges of
+.I file1_fd
+that are known to contain data written by application software.
+Each sub-range may be expanded (both upwards and downwards) to align with the
+file allocation unit.
+For files on the data device, this is one filesystem block.
+For files on the realtime device, this is the realtime extent size.
+This facility can be used to implement fast atomic scatter-gather writes of any
+complexity for software-defined storage targets if all writes are aligned to
+the file allocation unit.
+.TP
+.B XFS_EXCH_RANGE_DRY_RUN
+Check the parameters and the feasibility of the operation, but do not change
+anything.
+.TP
+.B XFS_EXCH_RANGE_COMMIT
+This flag is a combination of
+.BR XFS_EXCH_RANGE_FILE2_FRESH " | " XFS_EXCH_RANGE_FSYNC
+and can be used to commit changes to
+.I file2_fd
+to persistent storage if and only if file2 has not changed.
+.TP
+.B XFS_EXCH_RANGE_FULL_FILES
+Require that
+.IR file1_offset " and " file2_offset
+are zero, and that the
+.I length
+field matches the lengths of both files.
+If not,
+.B EDOM
+will be returned.
+This option is not compatible with
+.BR XFS_EXCH_RANGE_TO_EOF .
+.TP
+.B XFS_EXCH_RANGE_NONATOMIC
+This flag relaxes the requirement that readers see only the old contents or
+the new contents in their entirety.
+If the system fails before all modified in-core data and metadata updates
+are persisted to disk, the contents of both file ranges after recovery are not
+defined and may be a mix of both.
+
+Do not use this flag unless the contents of both ranges are known to be
+identical and there are no other writers.
+.RE
+.PP
+.SH RETURN VALUE
+On error, \-1 is returned, and
+.I errno
+is set to indicate the error.
+.PP
+.SH ERRORS
+Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:
+.TP
+.B EBADF
+.IR file1_fd
+is not open for reading and writing or is open for append-only writes; or
+.IR file2_fd
+is not open for reading and writing or is open for append-only writes.
+.TP
+.B EBUSY
+The inode number and timestamps supplied do not match
+.IR file2_fd
+and
+.B XFS_EXCH_RANGE_FILE2_FRESH
+was set in
+.IR flags .
+.TP
+.B EDOM
+The ranges do not cover the entirety of both files, and
+.B XFS_EXCH_RANGE_FULL_FILES
+was set in
+.IR flags .
+.TP
+.B EINVAL
+The parameters are not correct for these files.
+This error can also appear if either file descriptor represents
+a device, FIFO, or socket.
+Disk filesystems generally require the offset and length arguments
+to be aligned to the fundamental block sizes of both files.
+.TP
+.B EIO
+An I/O error occurred.
+.TP
+.B EISDIR
+One of the files is a directory.
+.TP
+.B ENOMEM
+The kernel was unable to allocate sufficient memory to perform the
+operation.
+.TP
+.B ENOSPC
+There is not enough free space in the filesystem exchange the contents safely.
+.TP
+.B EOPNOTSUPP
+The filesystem does not support exchanging bytes between the two
+files.
+.TP
+.B EPERM
+.IR file1_fd " or " file2_fd
+are immutable.
+.TP
+.B ETXTBSY
+One of the files is a swap file.
+.TP
+.B EUCLEAN
+The filesystem is corrupt.
+.TP
+.B EXDEV
+.IR file1_fd " and " file2_fd
+are not on the same mounted filesystem.
+.SH CONFORMING TO
+This API is XFS-specific.
+.SH USE CASES
+.PP
+Three use cases are imagined for this system call.
+.PP
+The first is a filesystem defragmenter, which copies the contents of a file
+into another file and wishes to exchange the space mappings of the two files,
+provided that the original file has not changed.  The flags
+.BR NONATOMIC " and " FILE2_FRESH
+are recommended for this application.
+.PP
+The second is a data storage program that wants to commit non-contiguous updates
+to a file atomically.  This can be done by creating a temporary file, calling
+.BR FICLONE (2)
+to share the contents, and staging the updates into the temporary file.
+Either of the
+.BR FULL_FILES " or " TO_EOF
+flags are recommended, along with
+.BR FSYNC .
+Depending on the application's locking design, the flags
+.BR FILE2_FRESH " or " COMMIT
+may be applicable here.
+The temporary file can be deleted or punched out afterwards.
+.PP
+The third is a software-defined storage host (e.g. a disk jukebox) which
+implements an atomic scatter-gather write command.
+Provided the exported disk's logical block size matches the file's allocation
+unit size, this can be done by creating a temporary file and writing the data
+at the appropriate offsets.
+It is recommended that the temporary file be truncated to the size of the
+regular file before any writes are staged to the temporary file to avoid issues
+with zeroing during EOF extension.
+Use this call with the
+.B FILE1_WRITTEN
+flag to exchange only the file allocation units involved in the emulated
+device's write command.
+The use of the
+.B FSYNC
+flag is recommended here.
+The temporary file should be deleted or punched out completely before being
+reused to stage another write.
+.B
+.SH NOTES
+.PP
+Some filesystems may limit the amount of data or the number of extents that can
+be exchanged in a single call.
+.SH SEE ALSO
