From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

In preparation for documenting the realtime modernization project, move
the discussions of the realtime-realted ondisk metadata to a separate
file.  Since realtime reverse mapping btrees haven't been added to the
filesystem yet, stop including them in the final output.
