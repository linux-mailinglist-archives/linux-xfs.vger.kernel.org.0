From: Darrick J. Wong <darrick.wong@oracle.com>

The section of the xfs_io manpage for the 'chattr' command says to refer
to xfsctl(3) for information on the flags.  The inode flag information
was moved to ioctl_xfs_fssetxattr(2) ages ago, and it never actually
mapped the inode flag letters to inode flag bits, so add those to the
xfs_io manpage.

+The current inode flag letters are:

+.PD 0
+.RS
+.TP 0.5i
+.SM "r (XFS_XFLAG_REALTIME)"
+The file is a realtime file.
+
+.TP
+.SM "p (XFS_XFLAG_PREALLOC)"
+The file has preallocated space.
+
+.TP
+.SM "i (XFS_XFLAG_IMMUTABLE)"
+The file is immutable - it cannot be modified, deleted or renamed, no link can
+be created to this file and no data can be written to the file.
+Only the superuser or a process possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability
+can set or clear this flag.
+
+.TP
+.SM "a (XFS_XFLAG_APPEND)"
+The file is append-only - it can only be open in append mode for writing.
+Only the superuser or a process possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability
+can set or clear this flag.
+
+.TP
+.SM "s (XFS_XFLAG_SYNC)"
+All writes to the file are synchronous.
+
+.TP
+.SM "A (XFS_XFLAG_NOATIME)"
+When the file is accessed, its atime record is not modified.
+
+.TP
+.SM "d (XFS_XFLAG_NODUMP)"
+The file should be skipped by backup utilities.
+
+.TP
+.SM "t (XFS_XFLAG_RTINHERIT)"
+New files created in this directory will be automatically flagged as realtime.
+New directories created in the directory will inherit the inheritance bit.
+
+.TP
+.SM "P (XFS_XFLAG_PROJINHERIT)"
+New files and directories created in the directory will inherit the parent's
+project ID.
+New directories also inherit the project ID and project inheritance bit.
+
+.TP
+.SM "n (XFS_XFLAG_NOSYMLINKS)"
+Can only be set on a directory and disallows creation of symbolic links in the
+directory.
+
+.TP
+.SM "e (XFS_XFLAG_EXTSIZE)"
+Extent size hint - if a basic extent size value is set on the file then the
+allocator will try allocate in multiples of the set size for this file.
+This only applies to non-realtime files.
+See

+for more information.
+
+.TP
+.SM "E (XFS_XFLAG_EXTSZINHERIT)"
+New files and directories created in the directory will inherit the parent's
+basic extent size value (see above).
+Can only be set on a directory.
+
+.TP
+.SM "f (XFS_XFLAG_NODEFRAG)"
+The file should be skipped during a defragmentation operation.
+When applied to a directory, new files and directories created will
+inherit the no\-defrag state.
+
+.TP
+.SM "S (XFS_XFLAG_FILESTREAM)"
+Filestream allocator - allows a directory to reserve an allocation group for
+exclusive use by files created within that directory.
+Files being written in other directories will not use the same allocation group
+and so files within different directories will not interleave
+extents on disk.
+The reservation is only active while files are being created and written into
+the directory.
+
+.TP
+.SM "x (XFS_XFLAG_DAX)"
+If the filesystem lives on directly accessible persistent memory, reads and
+writes to this file will go straight to the persistent memory, bypassing the
+page cache.
+A file with this flag set cannot share blocks.
+If set on a directory, new files and directories created will inherit the
+persistent memory capability.
+
+.TP
+.SM "C (XFS_XFLAG_COWEXTSIZE)"
+Copy on Write Extent size hint - if a CoW extent size value is set on the file,
+the allocator will allocate extents for staging a copy on write operation
+in multiples of the set size for this file.
+See
+.BR ioctl_xfs_fsgetxattr "(2)"
+for more information.
+If the CoW extent size is set on a directory, then new file and directories

 Link the currently open file descriptor into the filesystem namespace.
