Thank you for doing this - it seems to be the least intrusive method to
finally fix this problem, I really appreciate you taking the work.

Nobody knows who curtis is, I think we can drop this comment now ;)
If we can't read the directory I think it's fine to simply error out here.

I think we can stop as soon as we have found ".." yes?  No need to continue
iterating the directory, either ".." is what we wanted, or it's not, but either
way we are done when we have checked it.  On the off chance that we have
a very large root dir, stopping early might be good.

Could there be any other reason for this failure?  Maybe something like:

			mlog(MLOG_ERROR,
_("%s is not the root of the filesystem (bind mount?) - use primary mountpoint\n"),
				mntpnt);

or similar?

in any case I think it needs the i18n _("...") treatment.

Thanks!
