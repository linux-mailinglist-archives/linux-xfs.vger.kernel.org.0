Fine by me, the name just needs to describe the action that needs to
be performed....

Right, think of iomap_truncate_page() as having exactly the same
responsibilites as block_truncate_page() has for filesystems using
bufferheads. i.e. both functions need to ensure the disk contents
are correctly zeroed such that the caller can safely call
truncate_setsize() afterwards resulting in both the on-disk state
and in-memory state remaining coherent.

Hence iomap_truncate_page() needs to ensure that we handle dirty
data over unwritten extents correctly. If we look further, it is
obvious that iomap already has this responsibility:
SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA does page cache lookups to find data over
unwritten extents. Hence it makes no sense for one part of iomap to
take responsibility for managing data over unwritten extents, whilst
another part ignores it...

If there was another filesystem using iomap and unwritten extents,
it would have exactly the same issues with iomap_truncate_page().
Hence:

This.
