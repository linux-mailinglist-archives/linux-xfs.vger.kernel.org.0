That's going to be difficult because we don't know how much space the
parent pointers are going to need ahead of time.  I'd guess probably
not.

I dislike having to lower MAXNAMELEN; that seems like it would result in
user complaints.

Deferring the discussion in that manner will require us to burn another
incompat feature bit to prevent older kernels that don't understand the
hashing from mounting a filesystem where the hashes are in use.
