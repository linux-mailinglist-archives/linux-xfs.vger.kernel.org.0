Hmm, I don't think that addresses the fundamental problem. This
phenomenon doesn't require log recovery. The same scenario can present
itself after a clean mount or from an idle fs. I think the scenario that
plays out here, at a high level, is as follows:

- Heavy transaction workload commences. This continuously acquires log
  reservation and transfers it to the CIL as transactions commit.
- The CIL context grows until we cross the background threshold, at
  which point we schedule a background push.
- Background CIL push cycles the current context into the log via the
  iclog buffers. The commit record stays around in-core because the last
  iclog used for the CIL checkpoint isn't full. Hence, none of the
  associated log items make it into the AIL and the background CIL push
  had no effect with respect to freeing log reservation.
- The same transaction workload is still running and filling up the next
  CIL context. If we run out of log reservation before a second
  background CIL push comes along, we're basically stuck waiting on
  somebody to force the log.

IOW, the second background CIL push starts writing to the iclog where
the first left off, so that iclog I/O completion is where we end up
doing AIL insertion from the first (background CIL push) checkpoint.
Once the AIL is populated, I _think_ the workload stabilizes such that
AIL pushing can be used to free up space, etc., but I'm not totally sure
of that yet.

The things that prevent this at normal runtime are timely execution of
background CIL pushes and the background log worker. If for some reason
the background CIL push is not timely enough that we consume all log
reservation before two background CIL pushes occur from the time the
racing workload begins (i.e. starting from an idle system such that the
AIL is empty), then we're stuck waiting on the background log worker to
force the log from the first background CIL push, populate the AIL and
get things moving again.

IOW, the same essential problem is reproducible outside of log recovery
in the form of stalls as opposed to deadlocks via an artificial
background CIL push delay (i.e., think workqueue or xc_cil_ctx lock
starvation) and an elevated xfssyncd_centisecs. We aren't stuck forever
because the background log worker will run eventually, but it could
certainly be a dead stall of minutes before that occurs. I think this
could still be addressed at transaction commit or reservation time, but
I think the logic needs to be more generic and based on log reservation
pressure rather than the context from which this particular test happens
to reproduce.

Chandan,

If this is all on the right track, I'm still curious if/how you're
getting into a situation where all log reservation is held up in the CIL
before a couple background pushes occur. The background push threshold
is still fairly small relative to the size of the log. Could you apply
the attached patch to hack in some tracepoints to dump some CIL and
iclog state and 'trace-cmd record -e printk' a generic/530 run that
reproduces?
