Sorry for the late reply.

I'm not sure why stale data would be exposed. If we zero this hole
first, then write data, and finally update the i_size, before we move
the EOF, other operations won't be able to read the data in this hole,
So I think the stale data won't be exposed.

And I think an exclusive lock is indeed needed here. The main reason is
that we need to zero this hole, and the offset of this hole is based
on EOF, so an exclusive lock is required to ensure that the EOF is not
moved.
