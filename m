Hm.  At first I looked at _need_covered and wondered how this could work
properly if we are in state DONE or DONE2, because this not-quite
predicate returns zero in that case.

I think it's the case that the only way the log can end up in DONE state
is if the background log worker had previously been in NEED, written the
first of the dummy transactions, moved the state to DONE, and waited for
xlog_covered_state to move the log from DONE to NEED2.  Similarly, the
log can only be in DONE2 state if the background worker wrote the second
dummy and is now waiting for xlog_covered_state to move the log from
DONE2 to IDLE.

Since xfs_log_quiesce cancelled the log worker and waited for it to
finish before calling xfs_log_cover, the covering state here can only be
IDLE, NEED, or NEED2, right?  And hence the while loop pushes the log to
IDLE no matter where it is now, right?

(I also wondered why this isn't a do-while loop but patch 6 addresses
that.)
