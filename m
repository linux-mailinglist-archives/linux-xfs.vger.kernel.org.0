I don't know of a better way to do "xfs_repair the scratch filesystem,
but with a different scratch device".

One could create a new helper wherein any parameter that happens to be a
path to a regular file or bdev would cause SCRATCH_DEV not to be
included, but now we're walking arguments instead of being agnostic
about them and merely passing them through to $XFS_REPAIR_PROG
untouched.  Worse yet, if there just happens to be (say) a file named
'-d' or 'rmapbt=1' in the current directory, the test will think it
should omit SCRATCH_DEV.  The C getopt parser in xfs_repair won't see
things this way, and these two tests become brittle over that.

This can be worked around by parsing the arguments so that any getopt
arguments will not be subjected to the "Should we override SCRATCH_DEV?"
test.  Because xfs_repair options change over time, we'd have to scan
the binary to extract the getopt string (or construct it from --help).
This is nontrivial, so the xfs_repair getopt extraction routines
themselves will need a new fstest to test the test code, lest the two
tests become brittle over that.

All that fugly parsing crap can be worked around by teaching xfs_repair
to ignore any respecified data device paths, but this is likely to cause
resistance from the xfsprogs maintainers because that sounds like an
avenue to introduce confusing behavior to end users.

*OR* we could just override the variable definition for the one line
since (for once) bash makes this easy and the syntax communicates very
loudly "HI USE THIS ALT SCRATCH_DEV PLZ".  And test authors already do
this.
