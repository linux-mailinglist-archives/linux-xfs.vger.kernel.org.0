Sure, I'm fine with that approach. I posted this because it was
essentially where I started and there doesn't seem to be much agreement
on a proper fix.  We had precedent to use dm-thinp in generic/482, so it
seemed ideal to at least try to keep the tests active in the near term.
IOW, my approach was to either try for an obvious/simple fix to keep the
tests active or otherwise disable the tests (at least on XFS) until a
more involved fix is agreed on, tested and implemented. That more
involved fix could be anything from genericizing the dm-thin approach to
replacing it such that discard zeroing is not a critical component, but
I don't want to gate addressing the spurious corruption problem on a
nontrivial rework of the test mechanism.

Well, I was testing some of the zeroing commands Christoph mentioned
moreso than punch, particularly with intent to remove the dependency on
dm-thin. The problem with that is I don't think it helps much for
anybody who is testing on devices without hardware offload. The more
efficient in-kernel zeroing is still pretty slow, so I suppose it
depends on how often it must be invoked in a particular test (once? per
recovery point? on-demand buried down in the recovery code?). An obvious
mitigation, at least for the generic tests, is to reduce the size of the
target devices such that the manual zeroing is less noticeable. I don't
see much impact of using a 100MB fs, for example, and the recovery tool
already does the manual zeroing. The tradeoff is that I think we'd want
some kind of _notrun check in situations where we know the zeroing
doesn't occur.

I don't see much difference with zero/punch on dm-thinp. An
fallocate(FL_PUNCH_HOLE|FL_KEEP_SIZE) doesn't work because it explicitly
requests hardware zeroing, which I don't have.
fallocate(FL_ZERO_RANGE|FL_KEEP_SIZE) works, but takes a minute or two
on my 10G device because it falls back to manual zeroing. There is a
NO_HIDE_STALE variant of PUNCH_HOLE, but I don't seem to have any
userspace tools that define NO_HIDE_STALE and it looks like it just
sends discards anyways. Of course, a 'blkdiscard -o 0 -l 10g <thindev>'
unmaps nearly the entire device in ~1s, but then we're back to the
argument of using discard for zeroing. :P
