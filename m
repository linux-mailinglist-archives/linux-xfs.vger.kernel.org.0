We don't, unless there's a chance the filesystem will be booted
again on an older kernel. So it's a one-way conversion: once we
start using DT_WHT based whiteouts, there is no going back.

Yes, but that's not the problem. It's forwards compatibility that
matters here.  i.e. upgrade a kernel, something doesn't work, roll
back to older kernel. Everything should work if the feature set on
the filesystem is unchanged, even though the filesystem was used
with a newer kernel.

If the newer kernel has done something on disk that the older kernel
does not understand (e.g. using DT_WHT based whiteouts), then the
newer kernel must mark the filesystem with a feature bit to prevent
the older kernel from doing the wrong thing with the format it
doesn't exect to see. Mis-parsing a whiteout and not applying it
correctly is a stale data exposure security bug, so we have to be
careful here.

Existing kernels don't know how to take a DT_WHT whiteout and fake
up a magical chardev inode. Hence DT_WHT whiteouts will not work
correctly on current kernels, even though we have DT_WHT in the dir
ftype feature (and hence available on both v4 and v5 filesystems).
i.e. the issue here is the VFS has defined the on-disk whiteout
format, and we want the on-disk storage from chardev inodes to
DT_WHT. Hence we need a feature bit because we are changing the
method of storing whiteouts on disk, even though we
-technically- aren't changing the _XFS_ on-disk format.

Think of it as though DT_WHT support doesn't exist in XFS, and now
we are going to add it...

Rule #1: Never enable new on-disk feature bits by default

:)

Yes, in future we can decide to automatically enable the feature bit
in the kernel code, but that's not something we can do until kernel
support for the DT_WHT based whiteouts is already widespread as it's
not a backwards compatible change.

Cheers,

Dave.
