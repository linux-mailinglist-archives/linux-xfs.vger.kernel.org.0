You're assuming that the only thing we are going to want to return
-EAGAIN for freeing attamps for is busy extents. Being able to
restart btree operations by "commit and retry" opens up a
a whole new set of performance optimisations we can make to the
btree code.

IOWs, I want this functionality to be generic in nature, not
tailored specifically to one situation where an -EAGAIN needs to be
returned to trigger a commit an retry.

See above :)

Again, they are not the same thing: using the last entry in the
AIL here is incorrect. We want to replay all the items in the AIL
that were active in the log, not up to the last item in the AIL. The
actively recovered log region ends at last_lsn as per above, whilst
xfs_ail_max_lsn() is not guaranteed to be less than last_lsn before
we start walking it.

In what case are we queuing a *new* intent into the AIL that has a
LSN less than xlog_assign_lsn(log->l_curr_cycle, log->l_curr_block)?
If we are doing that *anywhere*, then we have a likely journal
corruption bug in the code because it indicates we committed that
item to the journal over something in the log we are currently
replaying.

The changes made in that transaction, including the newly logged
EFI, get committed before the rest of the work gets deferred via
xfs_defer_ops_capture_and_commit(). That commits the new efi (along
with all the changes that have already been made in the transaction)
to the CIL, and eventually the journal checkpoints and the new EFI
gets inserted into the AIL at the LSN of the checkpoint.

The LSN of the checkpoint is curr_cycle/block - the log head -
because that's where the start record of the checkpoint is
physically written.  As each iclog is filled, the log head moves
forward - it always points at the location that the next journal
write will be written to. At the end of a checkpoint, the LSN of the
start record is used for AIL insertion.

Hence if a new log item created by recovery has a LSN less than
last_lsn, then we have a serious bug somewhere that needs to be
found and fixed. The use of last_lsn tells us something has gone
badly wrong during recovery, the use of xfs_ail_max_lsn() removes
the detection of the issue and now we don't know that something has
gone badly wrong...

All of the intent recovery stuff uses
xfs_defer_ops_capture_and_commit() to commit the intent being
replayed and cause all further new intent processing in that chain
to be defered until after all the intents recovered from the journal
have been iterated. All those new intents end up in the AIL at a LSN
index >= last_lsn.

Cheers,

Dave.
