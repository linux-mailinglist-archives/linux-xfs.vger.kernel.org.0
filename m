Umm, I can see how I messed up the SCRATCH_MNT filtering and didn't notice
- thanks for fixing that. But the error message should not be there. The
previous mount completely failed so we end up touching file on the parent
filesystem which succeeds (well, unless the parent filesystem is read-only
as well). So to avoid this obscure behavior, we should add something like
(untested):

diff --git a/tests/generic/050 b/tests/generic/050
index cf2b93814267..593e2e69bf9a 100755
--- a/tests/generic/050

+       echo "touching file on read-only filesystem (should fail)"

and update xfsquota output accordingly...
