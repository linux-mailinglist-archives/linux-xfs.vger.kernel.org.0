No, afaict.

I mean... is libxfs even a real library? :)

Yeah, I don't understand why libxfs_destroy doesn't empty out the same
struct libxfs_init that libxfs_init populates.  Or why we have a global
variable named "x", or why the buffer cache is a global variable.
However, those sound like refactoring for another series.

Ok, I'll add a separate patch to null out the xfs_mount so that any
further use (afaict there aren't any) will crash immediately on reuse.
