A few other random notes that don't fit anywhere:

If you decide to enable upgrades by adding an XFS_DIFLAG2 to indicate
that a particular file has large extent counts, I think you can copy the
same mechanisms that the DIFLAG2_BIGTIME flag uses as a template.  I
think you'd need an extra bit of logic in xfs_trans_log_inode to turn on
the feature bit and move the n*extents fields around if either extent
count exceeds the old limits.

Please export the NREXT64 feature flag via an XFS_FSOP_GEOM flag so that
userspace can detect support for having a lot of extents.  This will
make it easy for libfrog to figure out that it should set the "send
large extent counts" bulkstat flag.  It'll also make it easier to
perform feature detection in fstests.
