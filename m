Well ok, it works with the /huge/ exception that there is no
percpu_rwsem_down_write_trylock, which means that we can't have the log
opportunistically try to grab it while covering.  That's kind of a
bummer, since I don't think that's at all desirable.

Ok?  Though /me is busy collecting things for 5.12 ATM... :)
