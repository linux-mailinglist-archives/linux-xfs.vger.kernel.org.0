That seems reasonable to me. I agree with the method used to fix the
problem, but I have some concerns/questions over where/how it is
implemented.

At this point in the mount, the transaction subsystem is not
really available for use. I understand that this is an empty
transaction and it doesn't reserve log space, but I don't like
creating an implicit requirement that xfs_trans_alloc_empty() never
touches log state for this code to work correctly into the future.

That is, the log isn't in a state where we can run normal
transactions because we can still have pending intent recovery
queued in the AIL. These can't be moved from the tail of the AIL
until xfs_log_mount_finish() is called to remove and process them.
They are dependent on there being enough log space remaining for the
transaction reservation they make to succeed and there may only be
just enough space for the first intent to make that reservation.
Hence if we consume any log space before we recover intents, we can
deadlock on log space when then trying to recover the intents. And
because the AIL can't push on intents, the same reservation deadlock
could occur with any transaction reservation we try to run before
xfs_log_mount_finish() has been run.

Yes, I know this is an empty transaction and so it doesn't push on
the log or consume any space. But I think it's a bad precedent even
to use transactions at all when we know we are in the middle of log
recovery and the transaction subsystem is not open for general use
yet.  Hence I think using transaction handles - even empty ones -
before xfs_log_mount_finish() is run is a pattern we want to avoid
if at all possible.

Looking at the code here, AFAICT the only thing the tp is absolutely
required for here is to hold the mount pointer - all the internal
bitmap walk operations grab and release buffers using interfaces
that can handle a null tp being passed.

Hence it looks to me like a transaction context isn't necessary for
this read-only bitmap walk. Is that correct?  Converting
xfs_rtalloc_query_all() to take a mount and a trans would also make
this code becomes a lot simpler....

This is pretty much doing the same thing that
xfs_check_summary_counts() does for the data device. That is done
before we mount the rt inodes, but it could be done after this, too.

Does it make any sense to move xfs_check_summary_counts() and then
centralise all the summary counter reinitialisation in the one
place under the same runtime recovery context?

Cheers,

Dave.
