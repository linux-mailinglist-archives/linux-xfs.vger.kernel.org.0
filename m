It's true that (AFAICT) this is the only place where xfs might need
mp->m_super but it doesn't yet have one, but you'd agree that this is a
significant change to the scoping rules, right?  In the past there was
never a place in xfs where we'd have to check mp->m_super == NULL, but
now we have to keep that possibility in mind, at least for any function
that can be called before get_tree_bdev.

Um, we used to obtain the block device and the superblock before we
started option parsing.  I guess the worst that happens is that anything
trying to dereference mp->m_super is just going to crash...

...oh well I should probably go complain to the new series, not this
one.
