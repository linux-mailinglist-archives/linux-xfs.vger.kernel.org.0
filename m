I'm still not grokking what "passed back out" is supposed to mean
or how it is implemented.

Sure, but buffers that have XFS_BLI_HOLD is set are not unlocked on
transaction commit. So this makes little sense to me.

A bunch of notes follows as I tried to make sense of this....

We have deferop "save/restore" resources functions that store held
buffers/inodes on save and hold them again on restore via a struct
xfs_defer_resources. This is only used to wrap transaction commits
in xfs_defer_trans_roll(), which means that the held objects stay
held across the entire transaction commit and defer ops processing.

Then we have "capture/free/continue/rele" which use the same struct
xfs_defer_resources but only takes direct references to buffers and
inodes they "hold" and rather than transaction scope references.
Hence before commit, they have to be relocked and rejoined to the
transaction. Ugh - same xfs_defer_resources structure, different
semantic meaning of contents.

Uses xfs_defer_restore_resources() internally, so it joins *and
holds* those items at the transaction level, meaning they do not get
unlocked by the subsequent transaction commit.  And then it is
committed like so:

                xfs_defer_ops_continue(dfc, tp, &dres);
		error = xfs_trans_commit(tp);
		xfs_defer_resources_rele(&dres);

And then because the objects are held and not unlocked by the
transaction commit, they need to be unlocked and released by the
xfs_defer_resources_rele() call.  But we've hacked dres.nbufs = 0,
so buffers are not released after transaction commit. This makes no
obvious sense - transaction commit does not free/release held
buffers, nor does xfs_defer_resources_rele(), so this just looks
like a buffer leak to me.

[ the API is a mess here - why does xfs_defer_ops_continue() memcpy
dfc->dres to dres, then get freed, then dres get passed to
xfs_defer_resources_rele()? Why isn't this simply:

		xfs_defer_ops_capture_continue(dfc, tp);
		error = xfs_trans_commit(tp);
		xfs_defer_ops_capture_rele(dfc);

The deferops functions are all single caller functions from log
recovery, so it doesn't make a huge amount of sense to me how or why
the code is structured this way. Indeed, I don't know why this
capture interface isn't part of the log recovery API, not core
deferops... ]

This still just describes what the code does, and so I have no
more insight into what is actually doing the releasing of these
buffers and why they behave differently to inodes....

Cheers,

Dave.
