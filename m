Seems reasonable to me.

There's two unfortunate twists for applying this series -- there won't be
any new for-next trees from Stephen Rothwell until Sept. 30th, which
means we (XFS developers) are all pretty much on our own for testing
this in the xfs for-next branch.

The second twist of course is that I'm leaving Friday afternoon for a
vacation.  That means either (a) everything passes muster, I fix the
comment nits, and push this into xfs for-next before I go; (b) there are
deeper review comments and so this waits until I return on the 16th; or
(c) I guess Dave could tack it on for-next himself when the patches are
ready since he still has commit access. ;)

Either way this probably means a separate pull request for the log fixes
during the second week of the merge window.  Thoughts/flames?
