Those fixes tags seem like a reasonable breadcrumb for finding fixes.
I'll add them to the respective patches on commit.  So for this third
one:

Oh, I was idly wondering if these iterators ought to have one more
training wheel where the loop would be skipped entirely if you did
something buggy such as:

agno = mp->m_sb.sb_agcount;
/* time goes by */
for_each_perag_from(mp, agno...)
	/* stuff */

Normally that would be skipped since xfs_perag_get(sb_agcount) returns
NULL, except in the case that it's racing with growfs.  But, some
malfunction like this should be fairly easy to spot even in the common
case.
