When does this happen?

Do you have tracing showing the operation where the relogged item
has actually gotten smaller? By definition, relogging in the CIL
should only grow the size of the object in the CIL because it must
relog all the existing changes on top of the new changed being made
to the object. Hence the CIL reservation should only ever grow.

IOWs, returning negative lengths from the formatting code is
unexpected and probably a bug and requires further investigation,
not papering over the occurrence with broadcast wakeups...

That just smells wrong to me. It *might* be correct, but this
condition should pair with the sleep condition, as space used by a
CIL context should never actually decrease....

Cheers,

Dave.
