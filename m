Adding complexity just because -you- think the memory is wasted
isn't any better argument. I don't think the memory is wasted, and I
expect that fsverity will end up in -very- wide use across
enterprise production systems as container/vm image build
infrastructure moves towards composefs-like algorithms that have a
hard dependency on fsverity functionality being present in the host
filesytsems.

That's not the case I see coming for XFS - by the time we get this
merged and out of experimental support, the distro and application
support will already be there for endemic use of fsverity on XFS.
That's all being prototyped on ext4+fsverity right now, and you
probably don't see any of that happening.

I don't think that fsverity is going to be an optional feature in
future distros - we're already building core infrastructure based on
the data integrity guarantees that fsverity provides us with. IOWs,
I think fsverity support will soon become required core OS
functionality by more than one distro, and so we just don't care
about this overhead because the extra read IO bioset will always be
necessary....

Having documented requirements and behaviour and then enforcing
them. There is no documentation for initcalls - they return an int,
so by convention it is expected that errors should be returned to
the caller.

There's *nothing* that says initcalls should panic() instead of
returning errors if they have a fatal error. There's nothing that
says "errors are ignored" - having them be declared as void would be
a good hint that errors can't be returned or handled.

Expecting people to cargo-cult other implementations and magically
get it right is almost guaranteed to ensure that nobody actually
gets it right the first time...

"return an error only on fatal initialisation failure" and then the
core code can decide if the initcall level is high enough to warrant
panic()ing the machine.

If they can gracefully fall back to some other mechanism, then they
*haven't failed* and there's no need to return an error or panic.

s/panic/BUG()/ and read that back.

Because that's essentially what it is - error handling via BUG()
calls. We get told off for using BUG() instead of correct error
handling, yet here we are with code that does correct error handling
and we're being told to replace it with BUG() because the errors
aren't handled by the infrastructure calling our code. Gross, nasty
and really, really needs to be documented.
