aha, thanks for refreshing my memory.

<nod> Will it be a problem if we crash with a log incompat bit set but
none of the actual log items that it protects in the ondisk log?

Ok.  I can live with that -- clearing the log-incompat bits on a clean
unmount, and leaving them set at cleaning time.  I think this means
l_incompat_users can go away too.

Without the "clear log incompat on clean" behavior, I don't think we
need anything I wrote about in that paragraph anymore either.

So, if I'm reading you both correctly, I'll:

1. change the log incompat handling code to clear them on umount only;
2. add a mount option to allow admins to permit setting of log incompat
   flags;
3. leave the xfs_{swapext,attri}_can_use_without_log_assistance
   functions as they are in djwong-wtf so that new incompat filesystem
   features will eliminate the need for setting/clearing the log
   incompat flags

Did I get that right?
