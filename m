Yes. As I wrote:
"tested that both configs fail with the same warning on v5.10.109"
Meaning the same bug that the test triggered before my change
in v5.10 is still triggered on xfs in v5.10 and it is triggered on both
xfs and overlayfs+xfs in v5.10 with my change.

The documentation is incorrect.
Current file is not closed.

fsync on the fs root dir is not the same as fsync on the original file.
mwrite does not change because mwrite is not acted on open fd
it is acted on memory mapping of mmap.

I can either change fd again to first fd before doing fsync
or change fsync to syncfs. Both solutions should be fine,
just a bit more work on the golden output.
I just wonder if we need to do anything at all as the bug is
reproduced and warning triggered anyway.

Yes, me as well.

Thanks,
Amir.
