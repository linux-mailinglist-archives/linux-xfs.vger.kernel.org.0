<shrug> Welllll... if someone presents a strong case for adopting the
utf8 casefolding feature that f2fs and ext4 added some ways back, I
could be persuaded to import that, bugs and all, into XFS.  However,
given all the weird problems I've uncovered with "ascii"-ci, I'm going
to be very hardnosed about adding test cases and making sure /all/ the
tooling works properly.

I wasn't thrilled at all the "Handle invalid UTF8 sequence as either an
error or as an opaque byte sequence." that went into the ext4 code.
While I concede that it's the least-legacy-code-regressive solution to
people demanding to create non-utf8 filenames on a "utf8-casefold"
filesystem, it's just ... compromised.

Really it's "utf8 casefolded lookups if all the names you create are
valid utf8 byte sequences, and if you fail at that then we fall back to
memcmp(); also there's a strict-utf8 creat mode but you can't enable it".

Gross.

fsdevel, the gift that keeps on giving...
