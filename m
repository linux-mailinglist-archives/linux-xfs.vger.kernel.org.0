The naming is taken from the existing code.  I think it stands for
parent which isn't quite true, but I think it tries to to document the
point that the file pointer is not for the inode we are operating on,
but some random open file on the file system that the handle operation
execures on.

Well, the clearing was just added the current merge window, before that
userspace could pass and them and cause havoc..
