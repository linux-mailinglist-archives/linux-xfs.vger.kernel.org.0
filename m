How does moving a highly shared extent vs a less shared extent help
with keeping free space contiguous?  What matters for that in a non-zoned
interface is that the extent is between two free space or soon to be
free space extents, but the amount of sharing shouldn't really matter.

But yes, independent of the above question, freespace for the zone
allocator is always very contiguous.

Yes.  And how do we kill it when it doesn't act in time?  How do we
even ensure it acts in time.  How do we deal with userspace GC not
running or getting killed?

I have to say all my experiments with user space call ups for activity
triggered by kernel fast path and memory reclaim activity have been
overwhelmingly negative.  I won't NAK any of someone wants to experiment,
but I don't plan to spend my time on it.

Will do.

Reporting that is more useful than just the shutdown would be useful.
How we get it on the other hand might be a bit hard.
