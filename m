<nod> I turned it on early because xfs/434 is still tripping over
leaked dquots, though annoyingly that problem goes away once I turn on
kmemleak.

Right.   XFS_ATTR_CREATE and XFS_ATTR_OP_FLAGS_SET apply to different
data structures.

<nod> Ok, I'll change it to use the same mask for validation that we for
validating xattr keys.

<nod> I'll send out the patches, though (since it's still Sunday night)
I won't get to making the adjustments I just mentioned until tomorrow.

The delalloc reservations still get deleted.  It's just the folio
invalidation and state changes that no longer happen.

Yeah.  In the end I decided to clean up xfs_attr_node_hasname's calling
conventions because the whole "maybe pass out a pointer or maybe don't"
was confusing and the source of at least one or two bugs.

<nod> I had a feeling that we were likely to end up at refcounted
name/value buffers.  ISTR Allison used to have it written that way but
changed it to the current style on account of review comments, but she
likely remembers that context far better than I.

Yes.  The leaks are (at the moment) a higher priority since I can
hit them in non-larp mode.  I'd also like to resolve the xattr log item
flags checking (even though it's EXPERIMENTAL) because in my experience
it's best to sand down those sharp edges before it ships in a Real Linus
Release. :)
