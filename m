Hi Andrey and Christoph,

This begins the first round of review of userspace support for the
metadata directory tree and realtime allocation group code that was
merged into kernel 6.13-rc1.

The first patchset contains bug fixes against xfsprogs 6.12.  I think
they're minor enough that they might as well get rolled into xfsprogs
6.13.

This time around, I'm presenting the libxfs sync for 6.13 a bit
differently than I've done traditionally.  Whereas I usually do all the
kernel sync and only then go to work on the surrounding utilities, I
noticed that the conversion of xfs_perag to be a subclass of generic
xfs_group objects and the introduction of xfs_rtgroup objects causes a
lot of changes in the utilities.

As a result, I decided that it'd be easier to take care of the libxfs
sync for only the metadata directory tree code and the utility changes
*before* moving on to the allocation groups restructuring.  That's why
there are nine patchsets instead of five.  I hope that makes it easier
to tackle.

The second and third patchsets are all the metadir changes.

The fourth patchset augments the mkfs protofile code so that we can
handle large files and xattrs; and provides a tool to generate a
protofile from a directory tree.  Protofiles have existed in Unix for 51
years now, we should modernize our implementation a bit, or possibly
just withdraw it.

Patchsets 5 and 6 are the rest of the 6.13 merge.  Eventually this will
become one patchset, but not all of my bugfixes have made it into the
kernel yet.  I'll be resending bugfixes II shortly after this.

Patchset 7 are the utility changes to handle realtime allocation groups.

Patchsets 8-9 update the utilities for the quota file changes that we
made for metadir filesystems.

As always, you can browse / pull the branch from here:
