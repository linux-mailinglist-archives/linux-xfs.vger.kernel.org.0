I don't, and am perfectly happy to send an alternate patch that errors
out if you try to obfuscate an asciici filesystem.  Or maybe doesn't
even error out, since names less than 5 letters aren't obfuscated, so
it's not like we're hiding things effectively anyway.

That said, Carlos is the maintainer, so let's let him decide. :D

1) Gross loopy code; or
2) Less test coverage of broken code; or
3) Control gross loopy code with a flag so that debugger commands can
   still do gross things, but metadump won't.

--D
