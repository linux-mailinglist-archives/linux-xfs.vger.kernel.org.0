As a reviewer, I am pointing out that I object to how this patch is
implemented and offered several fairly simple suggestions on how to
address my concerns. Those suggestions have been rejected pretty much
out of hand on the basis of the existence of some future plans.

Future rework plans do not justify or change my view of this patch and
the mess it adds (for other developers, for historical context and
downstreams, etc.). Therefore, if the only option you're willing to
consider is "make this mess now and clean it up later in some broader
rework," then I'd rather we just defer this patch until after that
rework is available and avoid the mess that way.
