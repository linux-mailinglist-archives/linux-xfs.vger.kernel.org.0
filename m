The problem I want to raise is not about code size increase, but about
having XFS_RT tied with BLK_DEV_ZONED.
I know it doesn't force users to use XFS_RT, but there are distros out
there which purposely disables XFS_RT, but at the same time might want
BLK_DEV_ZONED enabled to use, for example with btrfs.

But for the average user, wouldn't be the distribution's responsibility
to actually properly enable/disable the correct configuration?
I don't see average users building their own kernel, even more actually
using host-managed/host-aware disks.

Well, sure, you can't tie the disk to a single machine/kernel.

Then perhaps the right thing to do is fix the message?

I see, but this is also tying XFS_RT with BLK_DEV_ZONED, which is my
concern here. Users (read Distros) might not actually want to have
XFS_RT enabled even if they do have BLK_DEV_ZONED.

You didn't change, but the overall context that line referred to did so
it got misleading IMHO, reason I pointed it out.
