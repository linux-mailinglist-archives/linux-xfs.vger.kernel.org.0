I've not really thought about that. If the extent needs moving, I'm
just going to move it for now regardless of whether it breaks
sharing or not. Like I said, there's plenty of scope for future
improvements here...

Similarly, this move will currently break hardlinks, too. The plan
to fix that is part of the next bit I'm working on - finding the
paths to the inodes that have stuff that need moving. This will
record all the paths to the same inode, so when we go to move the
inode we first create N tmp hardlinks to the new inode and then
RENAME_EXCHANGE each of the hardlinks in turn. Then we can clean up
the old inode and all the tmp hardlinks...

I suspect it will be a lot more complex with shared extents....

I'm not caring about that here. I'm assuming that the allocation
policy that has been put in place before the inode move is run will
prevent it. As it is, I'm (ab)using inode64 allocation policy which
places inode data and metadata in the same AG as the inode to get it
to move data and metadata to the required place....

Already noticed and fixed that :)

UNless it is bmbt blocks or attr data that need to be moved, and
then we still need to swap the entire inodes....

SOmething to be done later :)

Sure, optimisations for later, because still got to be careful about
bmbt blocks in the attr fork. :)

I'm kinda assuming stuff gets handled by the unlink of the original
inode. The new inode won't have blocks in the AGs that are getting
cleared out....

FWIW, I just realised I hadn't done any of the
owner/permission/timestamp/etc copying that needs to done to make
the new inode look like the old inode. That shouldn't be hugely
complicated to add...

Cheers,

Dave.
