Interesting, that seems notably larger than I'd expect. Wouldn't this
concern you if you just ended up with a 37GB single AG fs?

Do you know how much of that might be free space on the image side?
I.e., I'm wondering if the size is that large because you really need
the space for data, or rather as a workaround where it could otherwise
be formatted much smaller if the deployment side could grow it out to
well beyond 37GB without having issues.

With a 37GB 4xAG fs, that's still closer to ~9GB AGs, which doesn't seem
all that bad from a grow perspective. IIRC the insane filesystems I've
seen tend to have much smaller (< 1GB maybe?) AG sizes. Have you seen
grow issues with these ~9GB AG size fs'?

Either way seems reasonable. I think we're mostly talking about the same
thing. For a functional prototype I'd be more concerned with just
showing whether it works and then if so, whether it's useful/flexible
enough for the intended use cases.
