Some creative ifdefery could avoid that, but quite frankly it's only
necessary for limited allocation contexts and so the
overhead/interactions would largely be unnoticable compared to the
wider impact of memory debugging...

Yeah, it also has the advantage of documenting all the places we
need to be careful of allocation alignment, and it would allow us to
simply plug in whatever future infrastructure comes along that
guarantees allocation alignment without changing any other XFS
code...
