Hi all

Today I was running some file timestamping tests to get a feel for the
bigtime XFS option and to confirm that it was doing what I expected. 
Everything made sense until a certain point.

There are two systems:

 * PC-1: Slackware64 15.0, xfsprogs 5.13.0, 5.15.27 kernel

 * PC-2: Slackware64 14.2, xfsprogs 4.3.0, 4.4.19 kernel

On PC-1 with an xfs created many years ago, xfs_info reports bigtime=0 (as
expected).  Two tests were run:

 * > touch -d '1800/01/01 02:23:45.67' foobar
   > ls --full-time foobar
   -rw-r--r-- 1 jwoithe users 0 1901-12-14 06:15:52.000000000 +0930 foobar

 * > touch -d '2100/01/01 02:23:45.67' foobar
   > ls --full-time foobar
   -rw-r--r-- 1 jwoithe users 0 2038-01-19 13:44:07.000000000 +1030 foobar

Both results are entirely as expected: the times are clamped to the minimum
and maximum values.  The +0930 timezone in the 1901 date is due to there
being no daylight saving in operation in 1901.

A newly created xfs is also on PC-1 where bigtime was requested during
mkfs.xfs.  Bigtime is confirmed set according to xfs_info.  Three tests were
run:

 * > touch -d '1800/01/01 02:23:45.67' foobar
   > ls --full-time foobar
   -rw-r--r-- 1 radar users 0 1901-12-14 06:15:52.000000000 +0930 foobar

 * > touch -d '2100/01/01 02:23:45.67' foobar
   > ls --full-time foobar
   -rw-r--r-- 1 radar users 0 2100-01-01 02:23:45.670000000 +1030 foobar

 * > touch -d '2800/01/01 02:23:45.67' foobar
   > ls --full-time foobar
   -rw-r--r-- 1 radar users 0 2486-07-03 05:50:24.000000000 +0930 foobar

Again, everything is as expected.  Bigtime expands the maximum time out to
2486 as advertised.  The +0930 timezone in the last result is due to there
being no daylight saving in July.

Turning to PC-2, things became confusing.  This older enviroment also has an
xfs created many years ago.  Two tests were run:

 * > touch -d '1800/01/01 02:23:45.67' foobar
   > ls --full-time foobar
   -rw-r--r-- 1 jwoithe users 0 1800-01-01 02:23:45.670000000 +0914 foobar

 * > touch -d '2100/01/01 02:23:45.67' foobar
   > ls --full-time foobar
   -rw-r--r-- 1 jwoithe users 0 2100-01-01 02:23:45.670000000 +1030 foobar

Since the kernel on PC-2 is way earlier than 5.10 and its xfs filesystems
predate bigtime, I would have expected the times to be clamped between
1901 and 2038.  However, it seems that the system somehow manages to store
the out-of-bound years.  Doing so has an interesting effect on the timezone
offset for the pre-1901 years, but for years beyond 2038 there is no
directly observable problem.  Incidently, running

  stat foobar

happily reports the extended date in this case too:

  Access: 2100-01-01 02:23:45.670000000 +1030
  Modify: 2100-01-01 02:23:45.670000000 +1030

For a giggle I tried

  > touch -d '21000/01/01 02:23:45.67' foobar

and the system still managed to store the 5-digit year:

  -rw-r--r-- 1 jwoithe users 0 21000-01-01 02:23:45.670000000 +1030 foobar

This isn't what I expected.  Given an old userspace with an old kernel and
old xfs filesystem, dates outside the 1901-2038 range should not be
possible.  Given the apparent corruption of the timezone field when a year
before 1901 is set, one naive thought is that the apparent success of these
extended years on PC-2 (the old system) is due to a lack of bounds checking
on the time value and (presumedly) some overflow within on-disc structures
as a result.  This would have been noticed way before now though.

I am therefore curious about the reason for the above behaviour.  What
subtlety am I missing?

While this may be a well known quirk, it is rather difficult to search for
online.  I've tried a few things but they haven't turned up any relevant
matches.  Apologies if this is an FAQ that I can't locate.

Regards
