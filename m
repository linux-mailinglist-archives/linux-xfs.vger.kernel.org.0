Hi Amir, hi Dave,

I've got no objections to backporting this change at all. We've been
using the patch on our internal 5.15 tracker branch happily for
several months now.

Would like to highlight though that it's currently not yet merged in
linux-stable 5.15 branch either (it's in 5.19 and mainline alright).
If this gets queued for 5.10 then maybe it also should be for 5.15 ?

Thank you,
FrankH.
