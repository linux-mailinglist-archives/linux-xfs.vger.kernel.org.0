Ok, so I find all the DA/da prefixes in this code confusing,
especially as they have very similar actual names. e.g. da_state
vs delattr_state, DAS vs DA_STATE, etc.

Basically, I can't tell from reading the code what "DA" the actual
variable belongs to, and in a few months time I'll most definitely
have forgotten and have to relearn it from scratch.

So while "Delayed Attributes" is a great name for the feature, I
don't think it makes a great acronym for shortening variable names
because of the conflict with the existing DA namespace prefix.

Also, "dac" as shorthand for delattr context is also overloaded.
"DAC" is "discretionary access control" and is quite widely used
in the kernel (e.g. CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH, CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE) so again
I read thsi code and it doesn't make much sense.

I haven't come up with a better name - "attribute iterator" is the
best I've managed (marketing++ - XFS has AI now!) and shortening it
down to ator would go a long way to alleviating my namespace
confusion....

Why separate out the state machine? Doesn't this shortcut the
xfs_inode_hasattr() check? Shouldn't that come first?

As it is:

	case XFS_DAS_RM_SHRINK:
	case XFS_DAS_RMTVAL_REMOVE:
		return xfs_attr_node_removename(args);
	default:
		break;

would be nicer, and if this is the only way we can get to
xfs_attr_node_removename(), getting rid of it from the code
below could be done, too.

This really is calling out for this function to be broken into three
smaller functions. That would greatly simplify the code flow and
logic here.

Probably should put this at the end of the structure rather than the
front.

I'm also wondering if it should be kept separate to the da_args and
contain a pointer to the da_args instead of being wrapped inside
them.

i.e. we put the iterating state structure on the stack, then

	struct attr_iter	ater = {
		.da_args = args,
	};

	do {
		error = xfs_attr_remove_iter(&ater);
		.....
	
And that largely separates the delayed attribute iteration state
from the da_args that holds the internal attribute manipulation
information.

Hmmm - why are these new includes necessary? You didn't add anything
new to these files or common header files to make the includes
needed....
