If this helps you I will take iomap over but only if you and Christoph
stay around as main reviewers. There's not much point in me pretending I
can meaningfully review fs/iomap/ and I don't have the bandwith even if
I could. So not without clear reviewers.

But, - and I'm sorry if I may overstep bounds a little bit - I think
this self-castigation is really unwarranted. And we all very much know
that you definitely aren't an idiot. And personally I think we shouldn't
give the impression that we expect this sort of repentance when we make
mistakes.

In other words, if the sole reason you're proposing this is an
objectively false belief then I would suggest to reconsider.
