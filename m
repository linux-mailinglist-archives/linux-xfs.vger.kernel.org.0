Ok, I think I understand what you're trying to say.  Would it help to 
explain then that setting or removing an attr becomes part of the 
namespace operations later?  When we get up into the parent pointer set, 
a lot of those patches add an attribute set or remove every time we 
link, unlink, rename etc.  Did that help answer your question?
