Good catch. I'll remove that for the next iteration.

I used them to make it obvious what operation was being performed on
the unlinked list. In the end they might be simple enough to remove,
but when I first wrote this patch is was necessary to document what
operations were being performed by the code rather than it just
being a big tangle of spagetti...
