Indeed, I don't see it as a necessary feature for XFS, merely a "bs
coming in from other parts of the kernel" detector.  And boy howdy did I
ever find bs.

This, however, is a much better justification (IMHO) for removing the
places where xfs touches journal_info.  Would you mind adding that to
the commit message?

Heh.  I also found much much more bs and shenanigans of exactly the type
you'd expect from a global(ish) void pointer.

With the commit message amended, you can add:
