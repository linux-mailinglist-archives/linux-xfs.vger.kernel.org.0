Thanks for your question. I'm about to sleep, I might try to answer
your question here.

As for my current experiement / understanding, I think eliminating all
the empty AGs + shrinking the tail AG in a single transaction is possible,
that is what I'm done for now;
 1) check the rest AGs are empty (from the nagcount AG to the oagcount - 1
    AG) and mark them all inactive (AGs freezed);
 2) consume an extent from the (nagcount - 1) AG;
 3) decrease the number of agcount from oagcount to nagcount.

Both 2) and 3) can be done in the same transaction, and after 1) the state
of such empty AGs is fixed as well. So on-disk fs and runtime states are
all in atomic.

I didn't realize that possibility but if my understanding is correct
the above process is described as above so no need to use incremental
shrinking by its design. But it also support incremental shrinking if
users try to use the ioctl for multiple times.

If I'm wrong, kindly point out, many thanks in advance!

Thanks,
