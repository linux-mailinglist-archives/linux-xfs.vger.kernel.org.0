Heh, I wasn't aware of that. :)

The only one that I can think of is how to signal a partial completion,
but if you're only aborting on *fatal* signals then that doesn't matter.

Fixing the block layer seems like a better answer anyway.

Though looking through that patch raises the question of whether xfs'
control loops also need to check for fatal signals, similar to what the
online scrub loops do?
