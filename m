I am aware of that patch, but I considered the option to be somewhat
orthogonal, given that FS_XFLAG_DAX can be set (and inherited)
irrespective of dax support in the block device (and overridden via
mount opts if need be), so I didn't want to overload daxinherit.

Agreed, so I suppose any dax option should be an opt-in, e.g. similar to
the -d dax=1 proposal. That won't prevent users from neglecting it and
creating a fs which will be later incompatible with -o dax, but that's a
different story I guess..
