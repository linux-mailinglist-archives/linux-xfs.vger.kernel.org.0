Not really, in theory I could respin the whole series to move
FOO_repair.c into FOO.c surrounded by a giant #ifdef
CONFIG_XFS_ONLINE_REPAIR block; and change agheader_repair.c.

OTOH I thought it was cleaner to elide the repair code via Makefiles
instead of preprocessor directives that we could get lost in.

Longer term I've struggled with whether or not (for example) the
alloc.c/alloc_repair.c declarations should go in alloc.h.  That's
cleaner IMHO but explodes the number of files for usually not that much
gain.
