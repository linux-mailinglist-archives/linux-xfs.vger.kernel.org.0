I'm referring to the UNMOUNT_TRANS flag, not t_flags. With this patch,
we actually would write a start record in some cases because
need_start_rec is toggled based on the flags parameter and the summary
counter check zeroes it.

That may be true... TBH I wasn't totally clear on what that logic was
for (it isn't purely error injection). From the commit (f467cad95f5e3)
log, the intent appears to be to "skip writing the unmount record," but
that doesn't quite describe the behavior. Darrick might want to
comment..? If we do revisit this, I'm mainly curious on whether there's
a change in recovery behavior between having this specially crafted
record vs. just writing nothing. For example, does recovery still set
the head/tail based on this record even though we don't mark the log
clean? If so, do we care..?
