Ok, so I've just gone through the process of merging the two
branches to see where we stand. The modifications to the log code
that are needed for the larp code - changes to log iovec processing
and padding - are out of date in the LARP v29 patchset.

That is, the versions that are in the intent whiteout patchset are
much more sophisticated and cleanly separated. The version of the
"avoid extra transactions when no intents" patch in the LARP v29
series is really only looking at whether the transaction is dirty,
not whether there are intents in the transactions, which is what we
really need to know when deciding whether to commit the transaction
or not.

There are also a bunch of log iovec changes buried in patch 4 of the
LARP patchset which is labelled as "infrastructure". Those changes
are cleanly split out as patch 1 in the intent whiteout patchset and
provide the xlog_calc_vec_len() function that the LARP code needs.

As such, the RVBs on the patches in the LARPv29 series don't carry
over to the patches in the intent whiteout series - they are just
too different for that to occur.

The additional changes needed to support intent whiteouts are
relatively straight forward for the attri/attrd items, so at this
point I'd much prefer that the two patchsets are ordered "intent
whiteouts" then "LARP".

I've pushed the compose I just processed to get most of the pending
patchsets as they stand into topic branches and onto test machines
out to kernel.org. Have a look at:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dgc/linux-xfs.git xfs-5.19-compose

to see how I merged everything and maybe give it a run through your
test cycle to see if there's anything I broke when LARP is enabled....

Cheers,

Dave.
