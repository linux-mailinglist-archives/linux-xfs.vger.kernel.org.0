The reason why I bolted on the SERVICE_MOUNTPOINT= environment variable
is to preserve procfs discoverability.  The bash translation of these
systemd unit definitions for a scrub of /home is:

  mount /home /tmp/scrub --bind
  SERVICE_MODE=1 SERVICE_MOUNTPOINT=/tmp/scrub xfs_scrub -b /home

And the top listing for that will look like:

    PID USER      PR  NI %CPU  %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND
  11804 xfs_scru+ 20  19 10.3   0.1   1:26.94 xfs_scrub -b /home

(I omitted a few columns to narrow the top output.)

Notice how the path that the program is allegedly scrubbing (despite all
the private bind mount security mania) shows up in the ps listing, so
it's easier to figure out what each process is doing.  The actual
horrible details of the sandboxing are hidden in /proc/11804/environ

So that's the reasoning behind the somewhat backwards phrasing.  As they
say, "Permits many, money more!"

For everyone else following at home -- the reason for bind mounting the
actual mountpoint into a private mount tree at /tmp/scrub is (a) to
make it so that the scrub process can only see a ro version of a subset
of the filesystem tree; and (b) separate the mountpoint in the scrub
process so that the sysadmin typing "umount /home" will see it disappear
out of most process' mount trees without that affecting scrub.

(I don't think xfs_scrub is going to go rogue and start reading users'
credit card numbers out of /home, but why give it an easy opportunity?)
