Hmm.  It'd be nice to know what the kernel thought it was doing when it
went down.

/me wonders if this has anything to do with the EFI recovery creating a
transaction with tr_itruncate reservation because the log itself doesn't
record the reservations of the active transactions.

<begin handwaving>

Let's say you have a 1000K log, a tr_write reservation is 100k, and a
tr_itruncate reservations are 300k.  In this case, you could
theoretically have 10x tr_write transactions running concurrently; or
you could have 3x tr_itruncate transactions running concurrently.

Now let's say that someone fires up 10 programs that try to fpunch 10
separate files.  Those ten threads will consume all the log grant space,
unmap a block, and log an EFI.  I think in reality tr_logcount means
that 5 threads each consume (2*100k) grant space, but the point here is
that we've used up all the log grant space.

Then crash the system, having committed the first transaction of the
two-transaction chain.

Upon recovery, we'll find the 10x unfinished EFIs and pass them to EFI
recovery.  However, recovery creates a separate tr_itruncate transaction
to finish each EFI.  Now do we have a problem because the required log
grant space is 300k * 10 = 3000k?

It's late and I don't remember how recovery for non-intent items works
quite well enough to think that scenario adds up.  Maybe it was the case
that before the system went down, the log had used 800K of the grant
space for logged buffers and 100K for a single EFI logged in a tr_write
transaction.  Then we crashed, reloaded the 800K of stuff, and now we're
trying to allocate 300K for a tr_itruncate to restart the EFI, but
there's not enough log grant space?
