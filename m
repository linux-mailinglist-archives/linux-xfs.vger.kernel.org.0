This sounds like you are trying to solve the wrong problem - this
isn't actually a filesystem issue. The fundamental problem is you
have a read-only device that isn't being marked by the kernel as
read-only, and everything goes wrong after that.

Write a udev rule to catch these SSDs at instantation time and mark
them read only via software. That way everything understands the
device is read only and behaves correctly, rather than need to make
every layer above the block device understand that a read-write
device is actually read-only...

Cheers,

Dave.
