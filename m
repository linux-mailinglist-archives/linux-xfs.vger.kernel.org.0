From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

xlog_state_clean_log() is only called from one place, and it occurs
when an iclog is transitioning back to ACTIVE. Prior to calling
xlog_state_clean_log, the iclog we are processing has a hard coded
state check to DIRTY so that xlog_state_clean_log() processes it
correctly. We also have a hard coded wakeup after
xlog_state_clean_log() to enfore log force waiters on that iclog
are woken correctly.

Both of these things are operations required to finish processing an
iclog and return it to the ACTIVE state again, so they make little
sense to be separated from the rest of the clean state transition
code.

Hence push these things inside xlog_state_clean_log(), document the
behaviour and rename it xlog_state_clean_iclog() to indicate that
it's being driven by an iclog state change and does the iclog state
change work itself.
