Changing the size of the inode is is all that xfs_setattr_size()
should be doing. Stripping capability attributes should have been
already been done by the generic setattr code before we get to
xfs_setattr_size(), so ATTR_KILL_PRIV should not be set at that
point.

notify_change() used to always strip ATTR_KILL_PRIV from ia_valid
when it sets up the flags necessary to strip privileges in the
->setattr callout. But it doesn't appear to do so always anymore:

        if (ia_valid & ATTR_KILL_PRIV) {
                error = security_inode_need_killpriv(dentry);
                if (error < 0)
                        return error;
                if (error == 0)
                        ia_valid = attr->ia_valid &= ~ATTR_KILL_PRIV;
        }

If ATTR_KILL_PRIV is still set, this implies
security_inode_need_killpriv() returned > 0 for some reason. I'm
assuming that this code ran:

security_inode_need_killpriv()
  call_int_hook(inode_need_killpriv, 0, dentry);

And the only implemented hook is this:

LSM_HOOK_INIT(inode_need_killpriv, cap_inode_need_killpriv),

/**

 */                                                                              
int cap_inode_need_killpriv(struct dentry *dentry)                               
{                                                                                
        struct inode *inode = d_backing_inode(dentry);                           
        int error;                                                               
                                                                                 
        error = __vfs_getxattr(dentry, inode, XATTR_NAME_CAPS, NULL, 0);         
        return error > 0;                                                        
}                                                                                

And that's the xattr that the reproducer is setting. So, smoking
gun.

we've done a lookup on the security.capability xattr which it
found so notify_change() does not clear ATTR_KILL_PRIV. The xattr
gets killed in setattr_prepare() but it does not clear
ATTR_KILL_PRIV, and hence we hit the assert faili when we get into
xfs_setattr_size.

Looks like a regression introduced in 2016 by:

commit 030b533c4fd4d2ec3402363323de4bb2983c9cee
Author: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

    fs: Avoid premature clearing of capabilities
    
    Currently, notify_change() clears capabilities or IMA attributes by
    calling security_inode_killpriv() before calling into ->setattr. Thus it
    happens before any other permission checks in inode_change_ok() and user
    is thus allowed to trigger clearing of capabilities or IMA attributes
    for any file he can look up e.g. by calling chown for that file. This is
    unexpected and can lead to user DoSing a system.
    
    Fix the problem by calling security_inode_killpriv() at the end of
    inode_change_ok() instead of from notify_change(). At that moment we are
    sure user has permissions to do the requested change.

The bug is harmless, it will only trigger the assert on debug XFS
kernels, but otherwise ATTR_KILL_PRIV is not checked/used by
xfs_setattr_size.

Removing ATTR_KILL_PRIV from the assert is probably all that is
needed. Can you write a patch for that, Yumei?

Cheers,

Dave.
