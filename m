Stale comment from the original series a couple of year ago, I
think.

Nope, we have to order item locking based on an unchanging
characteristic of the object. log items can come and go, we want to
lock items in consistent ascending order, so it has to be based on
some kind of physical characteristic, like inode number, block
address, etc.

e.g. If all objects are ordered by the physical location, we naturally
get a lock order that can be applied sanely across differing object
types e.g. AG headers will naturally sort and lock before buffers
in the AG itself. e.g. inode cluster buffers for unlinked list
manipulations will always get locked after the AGI....

<shrug> reasons lost in the mist of times. Probably because I wanted
the sort->precommit->committing->committed to be listed in the order
they are actually called by a transaciton commit?
