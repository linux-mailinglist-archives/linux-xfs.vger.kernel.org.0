I agree, but that was the original goal from the start. It's easier said
than done to just have iomap accurately write/skip the appropriate
ranges..

That was kind of the point for this prototype. The flag isn't just
asking iomap to perform some generic write behavior. It also indicates
this is a special snowflake mode with assumptions from the caller (i.e.,
unflushed, sub-block/partial range) that facilitate forced zeroing
internally.

I've since come to the conclusion that this approach is just premature.
It really only does the right thing in this very particular case,
otherwise there is potential for odd/unexpected behavior in sub-page
blocksize scenarios. It could be made to work more appropriately
eventually, but more thought and work is required and there's a jump in
complexity that isn't required to fix the immediate performance problem
and additional stale data exposure problems.

This reintroduces the same stale data exposure race fixed by the
original patch. folio writeback can complete and convert an extent
reported as unwritten such that zeroing will not occur when it should.
The writeback check either needs to be in the fs code where it can
prevent writeback completion from converting extents (under ilock), or
earlier in iomap such that we're guaranteed to see either writeback
state or the converted extent.

Given the above, I'm currently putting the prototype shown below through
some regression testing. It lifts the writeback check into iomap and
issues a flush and retry of the current iteration from iomap_zero_iter()
when necessary. In more focused testing thus far, this addresses the XFS
truncate performance problem by making the flush conditional, prevents
the original stale data exposure problem, and also addresses one or two
similar outstanding problems buried in write extending patterns and
whatnot.

Since this all exists in iomap, no fs changes are required to provide a
minimum guarantee of correctness (at the cost of additional, occasional
flushes). If there are scenarios where the performance cost is a
problem, an additional flag akin to the IOMAP_TRUNC_PAGE proposal can
still be added and conditionally set by the fs if/when it wants to make
that tradeoff. For example, XFS could pass some ->private state through
the iomap_truncate_page() variant that ->iomap_begin() could use to
trivially eliminate the flush in the truncate path, or implement a size
or range trimming heuristic to eliminate/mitigate it in others. If/when
iomap has enough information to do selective zeroing properly on its own
without fs intervention, the flush fallback can simply go away.

I have some patches around that demonstrate such things, but given the
current behavior of an unconditional flush and so far only seeing one
user report from an oddball pattern, I don't see much need for
additional hacks at the moment.

Thoughts? IMO, the iter retry and writeback check are both wonky and
this is something that should first go into ->iomap_begin(), and only
lift into iomap after a period of time. That's just my .02. I do plan to
clean up with a retry helper and add comments and whatnot if this
survives testing and/or any functional issues are worked out.
