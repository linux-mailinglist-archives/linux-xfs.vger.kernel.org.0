queisce state doesn't solve those problems. The old log has to have
committed active items in it when we switch (e.g. intent items for
the location of the new log, alloc records for the new log, etc) and
the new log has to have active items after the switch (EFI for the
old log, etc).  Just because the log is empty when we start the log
switch it doesn't mean it remains empty as we do the switchover
work.

If we want to avoid active items while writing stuff to the log,
then we going to need a custom path building lv chains to pass to
xlog_write(), like how we write unmount records.

i.e. what we probably need is a pair of custom log record that isn't
an transaction or unmount record that contains all the information
for telling the log where the new log is, and another at the start
of the new log that records where the old log was.

That way we only need to care about LSN, head/tail, start
offset, length, any changes to transaction reservations for
different physical log characteristics, etc

Putting the log in an inode isn't needed for allocate/free of raw
extents - we already do that with grow/shrink for the tail of an AG.
Hence I'm not sure what virtually mapping the log actually gains us
over just a raw extent pointed to by the superblock?

That seems like just as much special case infrastructure as a custom
log record type to run it online, and overall the algorithm isn't
much different. And the online change doesn't require an on-disk
format change...

Cheers,

Dave.
