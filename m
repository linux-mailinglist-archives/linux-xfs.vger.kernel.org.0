It tells us when we have an unbalanced get/put pair in the code or
we are failing to clean up everything at unmount time (e.g due to a
shutdown bug). i.e. Unmount on debug kernels will assert fail if the
ref count is not zero, and this indicates either a resource leak or
unbalanced get/put pairing.

I just used exactly this code to debug the active references patch I
just sent. Three different conversion bugs, all count at unmount
time in a couple of different ways. One was:

IOWs, the passive reference counting we have right now is extremely
useful for debug and triage purposes, even if it not actively used
by the code right now for life cycle management. It was always
intended to form the basis of dynamic perag management (e.g. for
huge filesystems with millions of AGs and a shrinker to manage perag
memory footprint like we do inodes....) and it turns out that it's
also useful for shrink....

I'm not sure I follow you there - the perag reference count doesn't
manage the lifecycle of the perag object at all - it just keeps
track of the number of current users of the structure...

We pass the actively referenced perag pointer around int eh
structures that use it. The lifetime of the active reference matches
the structure that keeps track of it, so nothing should be doing
lookups that don't take reference counts because they should already
have access to a the relevant perag object that has been looked
up...

Cheers,

Dave.
