That's exactly how the superblock updates have been done since the
mid 1990s. It's the way it was intended to work:

- xfs_trans_apply_sb_deltas() applies the changes to the on
  disk superblock
- xfs_trans_unreserve_and_mod_sb() applies the changes to the
  in-memory superblock.

All my patch does is follow the long established separation of
update responsibilities. It is actually returning the code to the
behaviour we had before lazy superblock counters were introduced.

The m_sb_lock doesn't need to have any effect on this. It's to
prevent concurrent updates of the in-core superblock, not to prevent
access to the superblock buffer.

i.e. the superblock buffer lock protects against concurrent updates
of the superblock buffer, and hence while progating and logging
changes to the superblock buffer we have to have the superblock
buffer locked.

>  3) in-memory sb counters are serialized by some spinlock now,

No, they are not. Lazysbcount does not set XFS_TRANS_SB_DIRTY
for pure ifree/icount/fdblock updates, so it never runs the code
I modified in xfs_trans_unreserve_and_mod_sb() unless some other
part of the superblock is changed.

For !lazysbcount, we always run this path because XFS_TRANS_SB_DIRTY
is always set.

It does not change behaviour of anything at all, execpt the counter
values for !lazysbcount filesystems are now always kept correctly up
to date.

Yes, I forgot about the special delayed allocation space accounting.
We'll have to add that, too, so it becomes:

+	mp->m_sb.sb_fdblocks += blkdelta + tp->t_res_fdblocks_delta;
+	mp->m_sb.sb_icount += idelta;
+	mp->m_sb.sb_ifree += ifreedelta;

But this doesn't change the structure of the patch in any way.

CHeers,

Dave.
