debian will probably will not want --enable-cf-protections as a
configure option, and will enable CET via dpkg-buildflags as a
hardening option, which will then be turned on by default for relevant
architectures and series as of when debian kernel starts to support
it.

as that way, debian will be able to affect that change across the whole distro.

once CET is actually merged into kernel, I do not expect configure
options or debian/rules changes to enable CET. At most `export
DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS=hardening` should be enough in debian/rules.
