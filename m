If I understand your reply correctly, then maybe my expression is the
problem. What I replied before is:
1. I have tested the inode32 option with the metadata preferred AGs
enabled(Yeah, I do check if the AG is set with
XFS_AGSTATE_PREFERS_METADATA). And with the alternating-
punching pattern, I observed that the preferred AG will still get fragmente=
d
quickly, but the AF will not.
(That's what I meant in the first sentence of my previous reply...)
2. Then I tried to explain why it doesn't work in theory.

Sorry for any misunderstanding because of my unclear reply.

Shida
