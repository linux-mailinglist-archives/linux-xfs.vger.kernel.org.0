In theory, fs bio shouldn't care any DMA limits, which should have been done
on splitted bio for doing IO to device.

Also .dma_alignment isn't considered in blk_stack_limits(), so in case
of DM, MD or other stacking drivers, fs code won't know the accurate
.dma_alignment of underlying queues at all, and the stacking driver's
queue dma alignment is still 512.

Also suppose the check is added, I am a bit curious how fs code handles the
failure, so could you explain a bit about the failure handling?

Thanks, 
Ming
