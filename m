Can you be more clear that the fscrypt direct I/O support only requires this in
order to support I/O segments that aren't fs-block aligned?

I do still wonder if we should just not support that...  Dave is the only person
who has asked for it, and it's a lot of trouble to support.

I also noticed that f2fs has always only supported direct I/O that is *fully*
fs-block aligned (including the I/O segments) anyway.  So presumably that
limitation is not really that important after all...

Does anyone else have thoughts on this?

Doesn't this need to return an error if the bio's size gets rounded down to 0?
For example if logical_block_size=512 and data_unit_size=4096, and the iov_iter
points to 4096 bytes in 8 512-byte segments but the last one isn't mapped, then
7 pages would be pinned and the last one would fail.  This would then truncate
the bio's size to 0, but bio->bi_vcnt would be 7, so this would still return 0.
It would also be necessary to release the pages before returning an error.
