I don't think /anyone/ needs it, but we're spending a lot of time
speculating and arguing about a poorly defined feature that has never
been satisfactorily implemented.  I broke it two LTSes ago based on my
misunderstanding (and nobody said anything during review) by making the
kernel bump the warning count, and nobody noticed until RH QA hit it.

I spoke to Jan Kara yesterday about removing the warning counts, and he
said he was fine if we simply made the VFS quotactl code return EINVAL
if you try to set the warning values, and then just remove everything
else behind that.
