Have you ever seen a 'wizard' style installer?

Like one that firsts asks what to install, and then presents a list of
suitable locations that have enough space, supported filesystem features
enabled, and whatnot?

So to present a list of mountpoints that support DAX one has to scribble
over every mountpoint on the system?

That sounds ridiculous.

It is property of the mount point. Device supporting DAX is useless on
its own - the filesystem must support and enable it as well. Filesystem
support on its own is useless - it must be on a device that supports
DAX, has matching block sise, it must be enabled at mount time.

Then don't be surprised that the users use 'creative' ways to determine
the information the kernel chooses to not share with them.

That's broken indeed.

The user can do a lot of thing indeed. They can even unmount the
filesystem.

It can check that the mount point is suitable at the time of
installation. Of course, if the system is reconfigured afterwards the
application might fail. However, checking the requirements prior to
installtion still provides valuable feedback to the user. They can be
sure that the system was configured properly.
