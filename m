Overnight testing indicates generic/530 hangs on small logs with
this patch. It essentially runs out of log space because there are
inode cluster buffers permanently pinned by this workload.

That is, as inodes are unlinked, they repeatedly relog the inode
cluster buffer, and so while the CIL is flushing to unpin the
buffer, a new unlink relogs it and adds a new pin to the buffer.
Hence the log force that the AIL does to unpin pinned items doesn't
actually unpin buffers that are being relogged.

These buffers only get unpinned when the log actually runs out of
space because they pin the tail of the log. Then the modifications
that are relogging the buffer stop because they fail to get a log
reservation, and the tail of the log does not move forward until the
AIL issues a log force that finally unpins the buffer and writes it
back.

Essentially, relogged buffers cannot be flushed by the AIL until the
log completely stalls.

The problem being tripped over here is that we no longer force the
final iclogs in a CIL push to disk - we leave the iclog with the
commit record in it in ACTIVE state, and by not waiting and forcing
all the iclogs to disk, the buffer never gets unpinned because there
isn't any more log pressure to force it out because everything is
blocked on reservation space.

The solution to this is to have the CIL push change the state of the
commit iclog to WANT_SYNC before it is released. This means the CIL
push will always flush the iclog to disk and the checkpoint will
complete and unpin the buffers.

Right now, we really only want to do this state switch for these
async pushes - for small sync transactions and fsync we really want
the iclog aggregation that we have now to optimise iclogbuf usage,
so I'll have to pass a new flag through the push code and back into
xlog_write(). That will make this patch behave the same as we
currently do.

In the longer term, we need to change how the AIL deals with pinned
buffers, as the current method is definitely sub-optimal. It also
explains the "everything stops for a second" performance anomalies
I've been seeing for a while in testing. But fixing that is outside
the scope of this patchset, so in the mean time I'll fix this one up
and repost it in a little while.

FWIW, this is also the likely cause of the "CIL workqueue too deep"
hangs I was seeing with the next patch in the series, too.

Cheers,

Dave.
