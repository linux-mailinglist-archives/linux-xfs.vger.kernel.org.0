I'm a little confused about what's going on here.  We're about to write
a log record to disk, with h_tail_lsn reflecting the tail of the log and
h_lsn reflecting the current head of the log (i.e. this record).

If the log tail has moved forward since the last log record was written
and this fs has an external log, we need to flush the data device
because the AIL could have written logged items back into the filesystem
and we need to ensure those items have been persisted before we write to
the log the fact that the tail moved forward.  The AIL itself doesn't
issue cache flushes (nor does it need to), so that's why we do that
here.

Why don't we need a flush like this if only FUA is set?  Is it not
possible to write a checkpoint that fits within a single iclog after the
log tail has moved forward?
