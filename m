I'd suggest that it should be the same as the telldir cookie that is
returned by the kernel for the given entry.

You mean:

$ ls -i /bin/bash | cut -f 1 -d " "
175492
$

i.e. if you want to provide the inode number rather than just the
path, then let's use the same names as a real ls  implementation :)

I also suspect it would be simpler to separate it out into two
functions rather than the way it is implemented now....
