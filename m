Not sure about that. If we are getting the geometry for the purposes
of working out where something is on disk (e.g. the root inode :),
then we need what is in the superblock, not what is in memory...

Hysterical raisins that have long since decomposed, I'm guessing....

*nod*

I suspect the way repair uses the last_prealloc_ino can go away,
especially as the inode number calculated is not correct in the
first place...

That's a whole lot of cruft that we can avoid just by passing in
our specific stripe alignment.

What we need to kow is whether a specific stripe geometry will
result in the root inode location changing, and so I'm of the
opinion we should just write a function that calculates the location
based on the supplied geometry and the caller can do whatever checks
it needs to with the inode number returned.

That provides what both repair and the kernel mount validation
requires...

On second thoughts, knowing that many users have put sunit/swidth in
their fstab, we probably shouldn't make it return an error as that
may make their systems unbootable.

Cheers,

Dave.
