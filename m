Hmm. On the other hand, it's not immediately obvious that the if
statement only does an addition with rounding; it might as well do
something more complex. Darrick's version avoids making things more
complicated than they need to be.

Other ways of doing the same thing would be:

end_off =3D round_down(pos, folio_size(folio)) + folio_size(folio);
end_off =3D folio_pos(folio) + folio_size(folio);
