It is reasonable for flush user(usually submission) to be responsible
for finishing/flushing plug.

iomap is one good example to show this point, since it does flush the plug
before call bio_poll(), see __iomap_dio_rw().

OK, I will change to your style.

If there will be more such kind of poll usage in kernel, I think it is fine
to add the flag, but so far all the three aren't used very often.
