Can you post the test code, because 38,000 alloc/unlinks in 60s is
extremely slow for a single tight open-unlink-close loop. I'd be
expecting at least ~10,000 alloc/unlink iterations per second, not
650/second.

A quick test here with "batch size == 1" main loop on a vanilla
5.17-rc1 kernel:

        for (i = 0; i < iters; i++) {
                int fd = open(file, O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0777);

                if (fd < 0) {
                        perror("open");
                        exit(1);
                }
                unlink(file);
                close(fd);
        }


$ time ./open-unlink 10000 /mnt/scratch/blah

real    0m0.962s
user    0m0.022s
sys     0m0.775s

Shows pretty much 10,000 alloc/unlinks a second without any specific
batching on my slow machine. And my "fast" machine (3yr old 2.1GHz
Xeons)

$ time sudo ./open-unlink 40000 /mnt/scratch/foo

real    0m0.958s
user    0m0.033s
sys     0m0.770s

Runs single loop iterations at 40,000 alloc/unlink iterations per
second.

So I'm either not understanding the test you are running and/or the
kernel/patches that you are comparing here. Is the "baseline" just a
vanilla, unmodified upstream kernel, or something else?

On the contrary, there is extreme urgency to inactivate inodes
quickly.

Darrick made the original assumption that we could delay
inactivation indefinitely and so he allowed really deep queues of up
to 64k deferred inactivations. But with queues this deep, we could
never get that background inactivation code to perform anywhere near
the original synchronous background inactivation code. e.g. I
measured 60-70% performance degradataions on my scalability tests,
and nothing stood out in the profiles until I started looking at
CPU data cache misses.

What we found was that if we don't run the background inactivation
while the inodes are still hot in the CPU cache, the cost of bring
the inodes back into the CPU cache at a later time is extremely
expensive and cannot be avoided. That's where all the performance
was lost and so this is exactly what the current per-cpu background
inactivation implementation avoids. i.e. we have shallow queues,
early throttling and CPU affinity to ensure that the inodes are
processed before they are evicted from the CPU caches and ensure we
don't take a performance hit.

IOWs, the deferred inactivation queues are designed to minimise
inactivation delay, generally trying to delay inactivation for a
couple of milliseconds at most during typical fast-path
inactivations (i.e. an extent or two per inode needing to be freed,
plus maybe the inode itself). Such inactivations generally take
50-100us of CPU time each to process, and we try to keep the
inactivation batch size down to 32 inodes...

A typical RCU grace period delay is longer than the latency we
require to keep the inodes hot in cache for efficient background
inactivation. We can't move the "we need to RCU delay inactivation"
overhead to the background inactivation code without taking a
global performance hit to the filesystem performance due to the CPU
cache thrashing it will introduce....

Cheers,

Dave.
