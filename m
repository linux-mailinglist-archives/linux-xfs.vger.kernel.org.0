I don't think this is true. The other filesystems in the kernel using
iomap that do need logical to physical mappings also do not have their
context for `struct iomap_read_folio_ctx` (the struct bio) used by
.iomap_{begin, end} either. As I see it, the purpose of the `struct
iomap_read_folio_ctx` context is for processing/issuing the reads and
the context for .iomap_{begin,end} is for doing all the mapping /
general metadata tracking stuff - even for the filesystems that have
the logical to physical mapping requirements, their usage of the
context is for processing/submitting the bio read requests, which imo
the more high-level iomap_{begin,end} is a layer above.

If in the future this case arises, the L2P mapping info is accessible
by the read callback in the current design. `.read_folio_range()`
passes the iomap iter to the filesystem and they can access
iter->private to get the L2P mapping data they need.

Currently fuse is the only non-block-based filesystem using iomap but
I don't see why there wouldn't be more in the future. For example,
while looking at some of the netfs code, a lot of the core
functionality looks the same between that and iomap and I think it
might be a good idea to have netfs in the future use iomap's interface
so that it can get the large folio dirty/uptodate tracking stuff and
any other large folio stuff like more granular writeback stats
accounting for free.
