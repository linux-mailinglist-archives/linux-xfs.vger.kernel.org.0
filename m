Doh, sorry, thinko on my part.  -c is exposed in the raw xfs_io command
but not in the xfs_bmap wrapper.

xfs_io -c 'bmap -c -e -l -p -v <whatever>' test.img

If you are interested in online scrub, then I'd say yes because it's the
secret sauce that gives online metadata checking most of its power.  I
confess, I haven't done a lot of performance analysis of rmap lately,
the metadata ops overhead might still be in the ~10% range.

The two issues preventing rmap from being turned on by default (at least
in my head) are (1) scrub itself is still EXPERIMENTAL and (2) it's not
100% clear that online fsck is such a killer app that everyone will want
it, since you always pay the performance overhead of enabling rmap
regardless of whether you use xfs_scrub.

(If your workload is easily restored from backup/Docker and you need all
the performance you can squeeze then perhaps don't enable this.)

Note that I've been running with rmap=1 and scrub=1 on all systems since
2016, and frankly I've noticed the system stumbling over broken
writeback throttling much more than whatever the tracing tools attribute
to rmap.
