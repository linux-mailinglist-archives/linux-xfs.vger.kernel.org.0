<nod> So if (say) we were going to add dquots to this scheme, we'd
probably want to shift all the iop_sort functions to return (say) the
xfs_daddr_t of the associated item?

(Practically speaking, I don't know that I'd want to tie things down to
the disk address quite this soon, and since it's all incore code anyway
I don't think the precise type of the return values matter.)

Anyway, I'm satisfied--
