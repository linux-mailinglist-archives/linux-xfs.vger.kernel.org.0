Because I wanted to keep the xlog_write() api change separate to
relocating the lsn code out of xlog_write().

There are enough review comments of "don't move and modify in the
one patch" that I won't even bother trying to do even simple "move
and modify" operations in a single patch anymore.

I can combine them if you want, but then someone is bound to pop up
in another review cycle and say "please separate....". :/

-Dave.
