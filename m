Convert xfs.txt to ReST, rename and fix broken references, consequently.

Changes in v6:
	- undo text reflow from v5.
	- fix a typo.
	- change indication of defaults , as suggested by Darrick J. Wong, to
	  keep the read simple.
	- change delimiter of boolean option from a newline to an "or" (clue
	  from something like "<option> and <another option>" in the text)
	  because the former does not render well in html.
