This is a lot to digest; I'd like to go ahead and merge 3 patches out of
this 5 patch series and leave this + the upgrade patch until I get a chance
to digest it a bit more.

One thing at least, though:

This should be removed, IMHO; what is the point? The user can't do anything about
it, it proceeds anyway, and for all we know they started with less than 10% free.
So why bother printing something that might generate questions and support
calls? I don't think it's useful or actionable information.

Thanks,
