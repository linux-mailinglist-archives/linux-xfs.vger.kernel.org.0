Let's make it easier for you then.
I already decided to defer patches 9-11.

Since you already started looking at patches 6-8, if you want to finish
that review let me know and I will wait, but if you prefer, I can also defer
the log changes 6-8 and post them along with the other log fixes from 5.14.
That means that I have a 5 patch series ACKed and ready to go to stable.

Let me know what you prefer.

Thanks,
Amir.
