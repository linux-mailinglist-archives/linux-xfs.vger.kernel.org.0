You cut out the part of the error report that actually means
something to us. Can you post the error message in full?

$ man xfs_repair
....
  -d	Repair  dangerously.  Allow xfs_repair to repair an XFS
	filesystem mounted read only. This is typically done on a
	root filesystem from single user mode, immediately followed
	by a reboot.

Which typically happens if the filesystem full of inconsistencies
and corruptions.

How did you do the backup? Was it an image file backup from the
host, or a full filesystem rsync from inside the guest ?

Sounds like you simply backed up the image file on the host?

If so, did you freeze the filesystem in the guest (or the whole
guest VM) while you did the backup? If the guest fs wasnt' frozen,
and the VM was active while the backup was done as you say, then it
is guaranteed that the image file that was copied will contain an
inconsistent image of the filesystem. If there was lots of
modifications occurring at the time of the copy being run, it will
be full of corruptions and may well be completely unrecoverable.

DO you have any older backups you can try to recover from?

Cheers,

Dave.
