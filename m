This isn't related to low space mode. Consider a simple example of
xfs_alloc_file_space() calling xfs_bmapi_write() with a total param of
the maxlen + bmbt reservation. xfs_bmapi_write() assigns bma.total, this
makes its way to args.total and the allocation code thus won't pick an
AG with less space available than specified in args.total (see
xfs_alloc_space_available()). If args.total is what prevents AG
selection for a particular allocation, the allocation retries in
xfs_bmap_btalloc() are going to fail until we get to the one that does:

	args.total = ap->minlen;

... which basically means we're now free to select an AG that satisfies
minlen without any consideration for the "+ bmbt reservation" part that
was added to bma.total in the first place.

This is separate from the observation that the bmap code already assigns
[bma|args].minleft (xfs_bmapi_minleft()) to a value that considers that
additional bmbt blocks might be required for btree splits due to the
extent allocation/mapping. With that, my understanding was that a
bma.total of maxlen + bmbt res is unnecessary because the bmap code
already takes the bmbt res into consideration itself.

That was the intent of the first patch. :)

Yeah, the intent is to try and honor alignment in more cases. I don't
think this affects bmbt block allocation because of the minleft bits
mentioned above. Rather, this just means that if we _did_ have some
subset of AGs where bma.total (maxlen+bmbt res) could be satisfied,
we're no longer restricting ourselves to those AGs over others where
minlen+minleft+alignment might be possible. IOW, this takes into
consideration the behavior change from the previous patch (or Carlos'
variant thereof).

Yeah, I think what fell out of that ends up replacing the first patch.
AFAICT, this patch is still necessary to prevent bma.total from getting
in the way, though some discussion over Carlos' series is still in
progress. Either way, it probably makes sense for us to work things out
in that series first..
