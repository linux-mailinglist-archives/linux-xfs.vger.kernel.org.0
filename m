Bah, I just realized that you and I have already reviewed a lot of this
stuff for the kernel, and apparently I never backported that. :(

In looking at what's in the kernel now, I realized that in general,
the xfs_btree_bload_compute_geometry function will estimate the correct
number of blocks to reserve for the new btree, so all this code exists
to deal with either (a) overestimates when rebuilding the free space
btrees; or (b) the kernel encountering a runtime error (e.g. ENOMEM) and
needing to back out everything it's done.

For repair, (a) is still a possibility.  (b) is not, since repair will
abort, but on the other hand it'll be easier to review a patch to unify
the two implementations if the code stays identical.

Looking even further ahead, I plan to add two more users of the bulk
loader: rebuilders for the bmap btrees, and (even later) the realtime
rmapbt.  It would be helpful to keep as much of the code the same
between repair and scrub.

So for now we don't really need the ability to free an over-reservation,
but in the longer run it will make unification more obvious.

/me vaguely wonders if we ought to be reviewing both of these patchsets
in parallel....
