Currently PG_checked is used even with the bitmap-based approach, as a way to
ensure that hash pages that get evicted and re-instantiated from the backing
storage are re-verified.  See is_hash_block_verified() in fs/verity/verify.c.
That would need to be replaced with something else.  I'm not sure what else
would work and still be efficient.

No one has actually deployed the bitmap-based approach in production yet; it was
added in v6.3 and is only used for merkle_tree_block_size != PAGE_SIZE.  But,
the performance and memory overhead is probably not significant in practice.
I'm more worried about the file size limit of the bitmap-based approach, which
is currently ~4 TB.  *Probably* no one is using fsverity on files that large,
but introducing a limit for a case that wasn't supported before
(merkle_tree_block_size != PAGE_SIZE) isn't as bad as retroactively introducing
a limit for existing files that worked before and refusing to open them.  Huge
files would need something other than a simple bitmap, which would add
complexity and overhead.

Note that many filesystems use PG_checked for other purposes such as keeping
track of when directory blocks have been validated.  I'm not sure how feasible
it will be to free up that flag entirely.
