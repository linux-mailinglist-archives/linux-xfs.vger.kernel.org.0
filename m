Stale - I got rid of the per-ag AIO structures because having 500
completion threads in gdb is a PITA and it provided no better
performance. i.e. it had problems with large AG counts.

Right they don't work yet. I mention that in a couple of places.

Making it modular is easy enough, but that can be done independently
of this buffer cache enabling patchset.
