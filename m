Hmm.  I suppose a problem with "?" is that question-mark is a valid
filename, which means that our zapped symlink could now suddenly point
to a different file that a user created.  "/lost+found" isn't different
in that respect, but societal convention might at least provide for
raised eyebrows.  That said, mkfs.xfs doesn't create one for us like
mke2fs does, so maybe a broken symlink to the orphanage is... well, now
I'm bikeshedding my own creation.

May I try to make a case for "ðŸš½"? ;)

Yeah, I think this converts easily to:

	if (!uid_valid(VFS_I(sc->ip)->i_uid)) {
		/* zap it */
	}
