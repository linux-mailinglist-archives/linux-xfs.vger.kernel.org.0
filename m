We didn't do it in the first place because we started with the tag
walks that only ever terminate on NULL - that was Darrick's code
used in the inode cache walk functions.. Converting the rest of
agcount based walks was not straight-forward - there were different
cases that needed to be handled and this was the least worst way to
begin the conversion needed for shrink.

Looking back at the history, it was that last conversion for
GETFSMAP that caused the problems sb_agcount based walks in commit
58d43a7e3263 ("xfs: pass perags around in fsmap data dev functions")
where for_each_perag_from() was converted to
for_each_perag_from_range(). There was no termination leak before
this, and races with growfs were simply handled with termination by
NULL lookup return. The bug iwas introduced because we moved away
from termination on NULL lookup by adding a termination via loop
index to support GETFSMAP.

We knew about the API wart and put a plan in place to address it in
future by movign to iterators. That looks something like this but
without the C99 automatic cleanup so external iterator setup and
teardown:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/162814685996.2777088.11268635137040103857.stgit@magnolia/

So, yes, we need to fix the bug that was introduced, but asking why
the code wasn't perfect before it was merged doesn't help us make
small steps forwards towards solving the bigger problems we need to
address...

Ok, so there are two problems then - one is an off-by one that can
result in perag lookups beyond the EOFS racing with growfs instead
of returning NULL.

The other is loop termination via loop index limits can leak a perag
when terminating the walk on the end index rather than a NULL. I
think these two bug fixes should at least be separate patches. Fix
the off-by-one in one patch, fix the termination issue in another.

Cheers,

Dave.
