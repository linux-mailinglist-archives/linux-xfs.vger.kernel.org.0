Agreed, but you're making two distinct, significant modifications in
the one patchset. One is changing the way we use a generic library
functionality, the other is changing the entire structure of the
lookup path.

IOWs, I was not saying the end result was bad, I was (clumsily)
trying to suggest that you should split these two modifications into
separate patches because they are largely separate changes.

Once I thought about it that way, and
looking that them that way made me want to structure the code quite
differently.

I think you missed the point I was making. I'm not complaining about
whether it's a tristate return or not, it's the fact that it can
return buffers in different states and the caller has to handle that
inconsistency itself whilst still maintaining an efficient fast
path.

That's what makes the code difficult to follow - xfs_buf_insert() is
the slow path, so all the complexity and twisted logic should be
inside that function rather than directly impacting the fast path
code.

e.g. Most of the complexity goes away if we factor out the buffer
trylock/locking code into a helper (like we have in the iomap code)
and then have xfs_buf_insert() call it when it finds an existing
buffer. Then the -EEXIST return value can go away, and
xfs_buf_insert can return a locked buffer exactly the same as if it
inserted a new buffer. Have the newly allocated buffer take a new
perag reference, too, instead of stealing the caller's reference,
and then all the differences between insert and -EEXIST cases go
away.

Then you can move all the conditional lookup failure cases into
xfs_buf_insert(), too, and we end up with high level fast path code
that is clear and concise:

	/* cache hits generally outnumber misses by at least 10:1 */
	bp = xfs_buf_lookup_fast(pag, &cmap);
	if (likely(bp))
		error = xfs_buf_lookup_lock(bp, flags);
	else
		error = xfs_buf_lookup_insert(pag, &cmap, flags, &bp);

	xfs_perag_put(pag);
	if (!error)
		*bpp = bp;
	return error;

Cheers,

Dave.
