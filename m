Hi,

I also think this check in the VFS is redundant. :-)

After looking at vfs_ioc_fssetxattr_check(), why do we need to move the 
check of extent
size hint to vfs?  It seems a xfs-specific flag, right?
btw:
It is fine to move DAX and project id to vfs because they are supported 
by more than one
filesystem(e.g. ext4 and xfs).
