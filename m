My debug patch kept a per-mount maximum EFI extent count, and logged
whenever an EFI got logged with a higher extent count.  From last
night's fstests run, I saw this:

  11297 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 2 (RUNTIME)
      8 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 2 (RECOVERY)
   2598 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 3 (RUNTIME)
      3 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 3 (RECOVERY)
    216 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 4 (RUNTIME)
    100 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 5 (RUNTIME)
    862 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 6 (RUNTIME)
     39 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 7 (RUNTIME)
     22 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 8 (RUNTIME)
     40 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 9 (RUNTIME)
     26 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 10 (RUNTIME)
     17 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 11 (RUNTIME)
     14 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 12 (RUNTIME)
     42 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 13 (RUNTIME)
      5 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 14 (RUNTIME)
      5 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 15 (RUNTIME)
    509 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 16 (RUNTIME)

So I guess we /do/ see a healthy(?) number of EFIs with more than 4
extents attached, and more bumps to 16 than I expected.  Granted there's
a lot of mkfs action in fstests, so this still isn't capturing what
might happen if there was fragmentation ahoy.

Well ok the alwayscow=1 profile did this:

    170 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 2 (RUNTIME)
    133 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 3 (RUNTIME)
     24 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 4 (RUNTIME)
      9 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 5 (RUNTIME)
     29 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 6 (RUNTIME)
      1 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 7 (RUNTIME)
      2 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 9 (RUNTIME)
      1 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 10 (RUNTIME)
      1 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 11 (RUNTIME)
      1 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 12 (RUNTIME)
      1 EFI MAX DEPTH bumped to 16 (RUNTIME)
