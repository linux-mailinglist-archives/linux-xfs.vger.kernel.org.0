Funny, xfs has the same conundrum.  Adding Eric & xfs list to cc...

Yeah, e2scrub is bitrotting rather faster than I had thought it
would... but it's only available in Debian unstable.

Indeed.  Eric picked "xfsprogs-xfs_scrub" for Rawhide, though I find
that name to be very clunky and would have preferred "xfs_scrub".

In /theory/ the cronjob support in e2scrub (and xfs_scrub) were designed
to step out of the way if systemd is running, so at least in theory (on
Debian anyway) the two can be in the same package with the end result
being that e2scrub runs weekly in the background.  I've not tried in
rhel/suse environments, however.

I also don't see the point of supporting cron *while* systemd is active.
That increases the amount of corner-case testing we have to do, for
little gain.  It's enough work to maintain the systemd-with-timers and
sysvinit-with-cron scenarios.

If you're worried about the stability of systemd timer code, systemd's
timer support has been stable enough to run e2scrub_all/xfs_scrub_all on
my systems since late 2015, and I have no interest in supporting either
on a pre-2016 distro.  Practically speaking, I guess that RHEL8, SLES16,
and Ubuntu 20.04 will be the first LTS distros to support e2scrub at
all.

(As for xfs_scrub, it'll barely achieve alpha status in Linux 5.2...)

If you do end up creating two packages I'd name the systemd one
e2scrub-systemd over e2scrub-service.
