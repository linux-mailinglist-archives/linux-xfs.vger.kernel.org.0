Is it just "a bad idea", or "it won't work"?  I can imagine that
sometimes we want to have tests that do things that are generally a
bad idea, but it's the best way to force a particular corner case to
happen without having to run the test gazillions of times?

I do remember some cases where when we were using a 1k block size, the
test wouldn't actually work because the file system needed to be
bigger or the metadata overhead ended up causing an ENOSPC too early,
or something weird like that.  So that was a case were the merging
would _work_, and in fact was testing a combination that we actually
wanted to test --- but we had to adjust the test subtly so it would
work both on a 4k block size and a 1k block size.  I don't remember
which test it was, or we hacked it, but I'm fairly certain it's
something we've done before.  It's messy.

No matter what, it seems like we'll have to look at each of these
tests and treat them on a per-case basis.  We could have options which
allows the test to specify that it shouldn't be merging; but then we'd
still have to decide what we need to do.  And what do we do if we
don't want to merge for ext4 and xfs, but it would be useful for btrfs
(for example) to merge the options.  It's probably also going to
depend on which test scenarios that various file system developers'
test setups choose to use....
