Subject: [PATCH] xfs/014: try a few times to create speculative preallocations
Message-ID: <20220104020417.GB31566@magnolia>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-xfs.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-xfs@vger.kernel.org

From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

This test checks that speculative file preallocations are transferred to
threads writing other files when space is low.  Since we have background
threads to clear those preallocations, it's possible that the test
program might not get a speculative preallocation on the first try.

This problem has become more pronounced since the introduction of
background inode inactivation since userspace no longer has direct
control over the timing of file blocks being released from unlinked
files.  As a result, the author has seen an increase in sporadic
warnings from this test about speculative preallocations not appearing.

Therefore, modify the function to try up to five times to create the
speculative preallocation before emitting warnings that then cause
golden output failures.
