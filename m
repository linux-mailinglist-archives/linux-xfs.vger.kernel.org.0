I /think/ the premise of this is ok.

I found myself wondering if xlog_state_activate_iclog could mistake an
iclog containing 5 log ops from a real update for an iclog containing
just the dummy transaction, since a synchronous inode mtime update
transaction can also produce an iclog with 5 ops.  I /think/ that
doesn't matter because xlog_covered_state only cares about the value of
iclogs_changed if the log worker previously set the log state to DONE or
DONE2, and iclogs_changed won't be 1 here if there were multiple dirty
iclogs or if the sole dirty iclog contains more than just the dummy.

If I got that right,
