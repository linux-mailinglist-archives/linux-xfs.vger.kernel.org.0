So marvin7 actually has SSD. I was experimenting some more. Attached is a
simple reproducer that demonstrates the issue for me - it just creates 16k
file, fsync it, delete it in a loop from given number processes (I run with
48). The reproducer runs ~25% slower after the commit ab23a77687. Note that
the reproducer makes each process use a different directory so i_rwsem
contention is out of question.

From blktrace I can see that indeed after the commit we do ~25% more
writes.  Each stress-unlink process does the same amount of IO, the extra
IO comes solely from the worker threads. Also I'd note that before the
commit we were reusing blocks much more (likely inode blocks getting
reused) - before the commit we write to ~88 MB worth of distinct disk
blocks, after the commit we write to ~296 MB worth of distinct disk blocks.
That's understandable given the delayed inode freeing but it's one thing
that could possibly have effect.  That's how far I've come today, I'll dig
more tomorrow.
