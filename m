Arggh.

Perhaps now you might see why I really don't like naming things by
size and having the contents of those fields based on context? It
is so easy to miss things like when the wrong variable or type is
used for a given context because the code itself gives you no hint
as to what the correct usage it.

I suspect part of the problem I'm had here is that the change of
the type in the xfs_log_dinode is done in a -variable rename- patch
that names variables by size, not in the patch that -actually
changes the variable size-.

IOWs, the type change in the xfs_log_dinode should
either be in this patch where the log_dinode structure shape would
change, or in it's own standalone patch with a description that says
"we need to avoid changing the on-disk structure shape".

Making sure that the on-disk format changes (or things that avoid
them!) are clear and explicit in a patchset is critical as these are
things we really need to get right.

I missed the per-inode extent size flag for a similar reason - it
was buried in a larger patch that made lots of different
modifications to support the on-disk extent count format change, so
it wasn't clearly defined/called out as a separate on-disk format
change necessary for correct functioning.

I think that's correct, because the superblock bit will prevent
mount on old kernels that don't support the 64 bit extent counter
and so the zeroes in di_pad2 won't get overwritten incorrectly.

Cheers,

Dave.
