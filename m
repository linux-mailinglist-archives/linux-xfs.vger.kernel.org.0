Hmm, how about this for xlog_grant_push_threshold:

/*
 * Compute the LSN that we'd need to push the log tail towards in order
 * to have (a) enough on-disk log space to log the number of bytes
 * specified, (b) at least 25% of the log space free, and (c) at least
 * 256 blocks free.  If the log free space already meets all three
 * thresholds, this function returns NULLCOMMITLSN.
 */

and then this for xlog_grant_push_ail:

/*
 * Push the tail of the log if we need to do so to maintain the free log
 * space thresholds set out by xlog_grant_push_threshold.  We may need
 * to adopt a policy which pushes on an lsn which is further along in
 * the log once we reach the high water mark.  In this manner, we would
 * be creating a low water mark.
