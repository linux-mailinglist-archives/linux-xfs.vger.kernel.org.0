That's fair.

It is a bit hard for me to express my expectations in technical terms,
because you are right - you did provide all the information.

At a very high level, I would very much like the authors of patches
and cover letters to consider the people working on backports
when they are describing their work.

There are many people working on backports on every major
company/distro so I think I am not alone in this request.

The best I can do is point to an example patch set that
I eliminated from back port for being a "rework" and where it
was made very clear that the patch set contains an independent bug fix:

Holding everyone to your standards is not going to be easy,
but I will try :)

I am sorry that I made you feel this way.

The trigger for this thread was a patch that I missed.
Doing the post mortem, I was raising the postulate [with a (?)]
that the author (who happened to be you) was not considering
the bug to be severe, which you had later confirmed.

After that, the conversation just escalated for the wrong reasons.
I was trying to make a general plea for more consideration in
the people that do backporting work and it came out wrong as
an attack on you. I need to watch my phrasing more carefully.

I sincerely apologize. It was not my intention at all.
I hope we can move past this and avoid clashes in the future.

Moving on...

I was thinking later that there is another point of failure in the
backport process that is demonstrated in this incident -
An elephant in the room even -
We have no *standard* way to mark a patch as a bug fix,
so everyone is using their own scripts and regex magic.

Fixes: is a standard that works, but it does not apply in many
cases, for example:

1. Zero day (some mark those as Fixes: 1da177e4c3f4 ("Linux-2.6.12-rc2"))
2. Hard work to figure out the fix commit
3. Discourage AUTOSEL

I am not sure if the patch in question was not annotated with Fixes:
for one or more of the above(?).

Regarding AUTOSEL, I hope this is not a problem anymore, because
AUTOSEL has been told to stay away from xfs code for a while now.

Regarding Zero day, I think this is a common case that deserves
attention by annotation.

Any annotation along the lines of Fixes: ????/0000
could cover cases #1 and #2 and may work with some existing auto
selection scripts without having to change them.

Granted, it may also break some existing script by making them
unselect a fix for a commit they cannot find.

Maybe instead of annotating what the fix fixes, annotation could
be somehow related to how the bug was detected, on which version,
with which test? not reproducible?

Thoughts?

Thanks,
Amir.
