The goal is to avoid ENOSPC at a later time. We do this before filling our own
in-memory buffer pool with pages containing new contents. If we have dirty
pages in our buffer that we can't write out due to ENOSPC, we're in trouble,
because we can't checkpoint. Which typically will make the ENOSPC situation
worse, because we also can't remove WAL / journal files without the checkpoint
having succeeded.  Of course a successful fallocate() / pwrite() doesn't
guarantee that much on a COW filesystem, but there's not much we can do about
that, to my knowledge.

Using fallocate() for small extensions is problematic because it a) causes
fragmentation b) disables delayed allocation, using pwrite() is also bad
because the kernel will have to write out those dirty pages full of zeroes -
very often we won't write out the page with "real content" before the kernel
decides to do so.


Hence using a heuristic to choose between the two. I think all that's needed
here is a bit of tuning of the heuristic, possibly adding some "history"
awareness.


If we could opt into delayed allocation while avoiding ENOSPC for a certain
length, it'd be perfect, but I don't think that's possible today?


We're also working on using DIO FWIW, where using fallocate() is just about
mandatory...


Greetings,

Andres Freund
