Oh, I thought you're hurry to hope this test be merged, so I tried to help it to
catch the fstests release of this Sunday. If it's not such hurry, let's back to
the regular review workflow, I'll merge this test case *immediately* when I saw
a clear RVB on it from you. Then it'll catch the latest fstests release after
that (not guarantee this weekend). Hope that help.

Thanks,
Zorro
