I'm not familiar with your user environment, but it sounds like the use
case is essentially to read a file concurrently being written to and
freeze the fs. From there, you're expecting the readers to exit but
instead observe them blocked on close().

The ceaveat to note here is that close() is not necessarily a read-only
operation from the perspective of XFS internals. A close() (or
->release() from the fs perspective) can do things like truncate
post-eof block allocation, which requires a transaction and thus blocks
on a frozen fs. To confirm, could you post a stack trace of one of your
blocked reader tasks (i.e. 'cat /proc/<pid>/stack')?

I'm not necessarily sure blocking here is a bug if that is the
situation. We most likely wouldn't want to skip post-eof truncation on a
file simply because the fs was frozen. That said, I thought Dave had
proposed patches at one point to mitigate free space fragmentation side
effects of post-eof truncation, and one such patch was to skip the
truncation on read-only fds. I'll have to dig around or perhaps Dave can
chime in, but I'm curious if that would also help with this use case..
