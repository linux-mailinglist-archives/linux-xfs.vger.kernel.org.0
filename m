Yes, but I'm realizing now, that we may not need these helpers if we 
continue to move forward with the state machine.  With the state 
machine, we can simply flip the flag, set the next state, and move on 
since that region of code will not execute again.  The state switch will 
jump us forward to where we were without having to check if we already 
did it.

No, it was used in the previous series xfs_attr_set_later where I was 
aiming to rely more on the state of the fork rather than the state 
machine.  But with the new state machine in this series, I may be able 
to just drop this patch.

Sure, if I keep this patch in the set I will update it.  Things are 
still pretty wiggly, so i may still find a use for it, but hopefully I 
can let it go.

Ok, will fix if needed.  Thanks for the review!  Sorry for the stray patch!
