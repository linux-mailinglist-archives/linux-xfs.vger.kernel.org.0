Can you expand on the no-splitting requirement? Does it involve only 
splitting by XFS (IO spans >1 extents) or lower layers (RAID)?


The reason I'm concerned is that it's the constraint that the 
application has least control over. I guess I could use RWF_NOWAIT to 
avoid blocking my main thread (but last time I tried I'd get occasional 
EIOs that frightened me off that). It also seems to me to be the one 
easiest to resolve - perhaps do two passes, with the first verifying the 
other constraints are achieved, or one pass that copies the results in a 
temporary structure that is discarded if the other constraints fail.
