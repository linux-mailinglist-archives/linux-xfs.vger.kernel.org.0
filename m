Most != All.  We enabled it here, for development of future products.

Huh?  How did we jump from realtime devices to external log files?

Not many, I guess. :/

There seem to be a lot more tests these days that use dmflakey on the
data device to simulate a temporary disk failure... but those aren't
going to work for external log devices because they seem to assume that
what we call the data device is also the log device.
