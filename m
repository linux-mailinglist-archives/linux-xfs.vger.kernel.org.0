We do?  I didn't find /any/ helpers to fix shortform inums and ftype.
xfs_repair directly manipulates a lot of directory structures directly
with libxfs functions.

Frankly, I trust you (and everyone else) to know when a kernel patchset
heading upstream is going to require a lot of non-trivial changes to
xfsprogs and to send a patchset to make whatever cleanups to xfsprogs
are necessary and then port the kernel patches.

95% of the time, the API changes are pretty minor, and Eric and I can
just figure it out between the two of us.  The directory refactoring you
sent for 5.5 turned out to involve a lot more work and I didn't want
Eric to be 100% stuck with the burden of figuring out how to apply
everything.

But maybe I should start asking submitters always to send kernel +
xfsprogs patches at the same time.  Allison's been doing that with the
deferred attr patches and it's very helpful not to have to imagine what
the userspace changes will look like.

So anyway, I am sorry for ruffling your feathers.  I am particularly bad
at handling small cleanups to smooth over xfsprogs when reviewers are
short.
