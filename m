So in other words you're doubling the amount you pass into the overflow
check so that we can guarantee that a future dirent removal will work.

In other words, the doubling is to preserve future functionality, and is
not required by the create() call itself.  This should be captured in
a comment above the call to xfs_iext_count_may_overflow.

Or I guess you could create an XFS_IEXT_DIRENT_CREATE macro that wraps
all that (along with that comment explaining why).

<shrug> I doubt xattr trees often get close to 64k extents, so you might
as well apply the same logic to them.  Better to cut off the user early
than to force them to delete the whole file just to wipe out the xattrs.

In other words, we also want XFS_IEXT_DIRENT_CREATE here?
