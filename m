And what I'm saying is that is _wrong_. Darrick should be pulling the
branch that you cut from my email:

for-6.13/block-atomic

rather than re-applying patches. At least if the intent is to send that
branch to Linus. But even if it's just for testing, pretty silly to have
branches with duplicate commits out there when the originally applied
patches can just be pulled in.

That is simply not true. There's ZERO ordering required here. Like I
also mentioned in my reply, and that you also snipped out, is that no
ordering is implied here - either tree can send their PR at any time.

Just pull the branch that was created for it... There's zero other
things in there outside of the 3 commits.
