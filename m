True, but largely irrelevant for the purposes of demonstration....

Yes, I understand that we need to re-layer the attr code to get rid
of all the twisty passages that are all alike, but we don't need to
do that right now and it avoids tying a simple change up in knots
that prevent progress from being made.

[FWIW, I have a basic plan for that - split all the sf/leaf/node
stuff out of xfs_attr_leaf.c into xfs_attr_sf/leaf/node.c, move all
the sf/leaf/node add/remove/change/lookup stuff out of xfs_attr.c
into the above files. High level API is in xfs_attr.c (same as
xfs_dir.c for directories) and everything external interfaces with
that API. Which we can then tailor to just the information needed
to set up attr and da_args inside xfs_attr.c....

Then we can start cleaning up all the internal attr APIs, fix all
the whacky quirks like sf add will do a remove if it's actually a
replace, clean up the lookup interfaces, etc. ]

Yes, I think that's just fine. Simple is often best...

Cheers,
