So, consider yourself alerted :)

With CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG=3Dn the mount succeeded, and xfs_info says

yep: no reflink, but finobt.

No, this machine and its storage is new, and never ran a kernel other
than 4.9.x. The filesystem was created with mkfs.xfs of xfsprogs
version 4.9.0+nmu1ubuntu2, which ships with Ubuntu-18.04.

Isn't it surprising to run into ENOSPC on an almost empty 100T
large filesystem? If so, do you think the issue could be related to
dm-thin? Another explanation would be that the assert condition is
broken, for example because pag->pagf_freeblks is not uptodate.

Sure, debugging will be turned off when the machine goes into production
mode. For stress testing new hardware I prefer to leave it on, though.

Anyways, do you believe that the assert is just an overzealous check
to inform developers about a corner case that never triggers under
normal circumstances, or is this an issue that will come back to hurt
plenty when the assert is ignored due to CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG=3Dn?

One more data point: After booting into a CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG=3Dn kernel,
mounting and unmounting the filesystem, and booting back into the
CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG=3Dy kernel, the assert still triggers.

Thanks for your help
