Ok, that looks reasonable and nicely simplified from the current
approach. My primary concern on first seeing this patch was reservation
size. The remote blocks was the portion that stood out because it's
obviously not universal for xattr operations, but having taken a closer
look I see that it's actually a small portion of the overall
reservation. E.g., on one of my test volumes the reservation comes out
to 467448 bytes. It only drops to 459000 if I comment out the remote
block bmbt bits so we'd only save 8k or so by making that conditional.
Of course the unit reservation is still large (though the full
reservation is not actually the largest when you factor in logcount),
but that seems mostly a side effect of making it correct. ;P

Indeed.

No problem, thanks for the background/context.
