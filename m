Fixed.

And that's just fine - not everyone has to understand all of the
code all of the time. That's why we have a team....

And I'm telling you that this is *future work*. As the person
actually doing the work, that's my decision and you need to accept
that. I understand your concerns and have a plan to address them -
you just have to accept that the plan to address them isn't going to
be exactly to your liking.

No. That's just obfuscation. And it is extremely likely that the
first thing Christoph will ask me to do with one-shot flag that just
calls out to a single function is to get rid of the flag and call
the function directly.

This will get cleaned up. Just not in this patchset.
