Um... here's the kernel branch that I used:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/djwong/xfs-linux.git/log/?h=mount-api-crash

Along with:

MKFS_OPTIONS -- -m crc=0
MOUNT_OPTIONS -- -o usrquota,grpquota

and both TEST_DEV and SCRATCH_DEV pointed at boring scsi disks.

Yeah, I had the same problem too; you might spot check the commits in
there just in case /I/ screwed them up.

(I would say 'or rebase on for-next' but (a) I don't know how
Christoph's mount cleanups intermix with that and (b) let's see if
this afternoon's for-next is less broken on s390 than this morning's was
<frown>)
