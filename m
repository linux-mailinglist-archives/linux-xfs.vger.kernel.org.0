Seeing as the oldest LTS kernel now is 4.14, I agree with you, let's
just forget this whole patch and try to remember not to hide LOG
INCOMPAT features behind RO COMPAT flags again. :)

If we do that, then all we need to do is change xfs_validate_sb_write
not to complain about unknown rocompat features if the xfs is readonly,
and remove all the code that temporarily clears the readonly state
around the log mount calls.

Log recovery then goes back to supporting recovery even in the presence
of unknown rocompat bits, and patch 3 becomes unnecessary...
