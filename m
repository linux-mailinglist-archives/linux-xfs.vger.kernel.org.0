Hi Gao,

In my mind, the big question is whether or not the data the
filesystems pass in is logically shared by both iomap_begin/end and
buffered reads/writes/dio callbacks, or whether the data needed by
both are basically separate entities but have to be frankensteined
together so that it can be passed in through iter->private. My sense
of the read/readahead code is that the data needed by iomap begin/end
vs buffered reads are basically logically separate entities. I see
your point about how the existing code for buffered writes and dio in
iomap have them combined into one, but imo, if the iomap_iter data is
a separate entity from the data needed in the callbacks, then those
pointers should be separate.

But I also am happy to change this back to having it the way it was
for v1 where everything just went through iter->private. I don't feel
strongly about this decision, I'm happy with whichever way we go with.

Thanks,
Joanne
