Yup, that's a bogus state check in the asssert. I already have a
patch to fix that - the async shutdown can change the iclog state
to XLOG_STATE_IOERROR at any time, so any iclog state assert outside of
the log->l_icloglock needs also to allow for XLOG_STATE_IOERROR as
a valid state.

This is one of the problems I was alluding to on #xfs when I said:

[18/6/21 14:42] <dchinner> I'm really not liking getting repeatedly
caught out by racing, unreferenced iclog state changes during
shutdown and having to handle them everywhere.

Patch, FYI, below.

Cheers,

Dave.

xfs: fix incorrect assert in xlog_write_single

From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

generic/475 failed with this assert after a log shutdown:

[ 3953.166235] XFS: Assertion failed: *log_offset + *len <= iclog->ic_size || iclog->ic_state == XLOG_STATE_WANT_SYNC, file: fs/xfs/xfs_log.c, line: 2115

The problem is that after the log has shut down, the iclog state is
XLOG_STATE_IOERROR. The shutdown can change the iclog state at any
time while we are writing to it, so we need to add IOERROR to the
valid states here.

Note that we already have similar IOERROR state checks in asserts
in the xlog_write() code for this reason (e.g. in
xlog_write_get_more_iclog_space()) so this is just a case where the
IOERROR state check was missed. The IOERROR state will be processed
when we release the iclog, so just add the state into the assert and
let the iclog release code handle the error.
