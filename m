True.  The only time I saw this happen was with buffered COW writeback
completions (which hold lock other than ILOCK), which should have been
fixed by the patch I made to put all the writeback items to a single
inode queue and run /one/ worker thread to process them all.  So maybe
my fears are unfounded nowadays. :)

The only other place I can think of that does a lot of transaction
rolling on a single inode is online repair, and it always holds all
three exclusive locks.

Ok.  Looking back through lore I don't see any complaints about insert
range, so I guess it's fine.
