Hm, fair point. I think the historical fragility and complexity makes it
reasonable to question whether it's worth continued support. Looking
back through my notes, ISTM that the original report of the log
reservation deadlock came from fstests, so not necessarily an end user
report. I'm not aware of any real user reports around quotaoff, but then
again it's fairly boring functionality that probably just works most of
the time. It's kind of hard to surmise external dependencies from that
alone.

Personally, I'd probably have to think about it some more, but initially
I don't have any strong objection to removing quotaoff support. More
practically, I suspect we'd have to deprecate it for some period of time
given that it's a generic interface, has userspace tools, regression
tests, etc., and may or may not have real users who might want the
opportunity to object (or adjust).

Though perhaps potentially avoiding that mess is what you mean by "...
disables accounting vs.  enforcement." I.e., retain the interface and
general ability to turn off enforcement, but require a mount cycle in
the future to disable accounting..? Hmm... that seems like a potentially
nicer/easier path forward and a less disruptive change. I wonder even if
we could just (eventually) ignore the accounting disablement flags from
userspace and if any users would have reason to care about that change
in behavior.
