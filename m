I'm angling to hide the agfbp entirely here - move the allocation
serialisation to the perag using a mutex rwsem, not the AGF buffer.
We don't actually need the AGF until we have to modify it, so it's
lock hold time during allocation can be cut way down if it is not
used to serialise the entire allocation operation. This would also
get us lockdep coverage for agi/agf locking, etc.

Also, I'm intending that the perag init functions which currently
take a agno and then do a lookup for the perag to initialise it will
take a perag, not a agno. We almost always already have the perag
when we do a buffer read to initialise the perag...

Except in the buffer cache itself or callouts directly from the
buffer cache that operation under the buffer's existence guarantee
for the perag.

Oh, I'm planning on chopping them down, but going the other way.
Cache the ag bps in the perag so we don't ahve to do buffer cache
lookups to find them, nor do we have to pass them around anywhere
that we pass a perag....

Dave.
