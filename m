Neither, it was just me doing some code review over thanksgiving.

It also occurred to me to (re)consider this in terms of "What are we
protecting against?"  Adding feature checks to the CUI/RUI recovery
functions makes sense since we can't replay something into a feature
that isn't enabled.  For BUI items however, the bmap has existed forever
so we're really not guarding much.  If someone out there has (for
example) a V4 filesystem with a dirty BUI to replay, why not replay it?

So I guess I could just drop the feature check from the BUI recovery
function.
