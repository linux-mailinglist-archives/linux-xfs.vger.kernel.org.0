Ok, done.  Add this as a second paragraph:

"This changes the locking behavior for non-tempfile creation slightly,
in that we now make the quota reservation without holding the directory
ILOCK.  While the dquots chosen for inode creation are based on the
directory state at a given point in time, the directory ILOCK was
released as soon as the dquot references are picked up.  Hence it was
never necessary to hold the directory ILOCK for the quota reservation."
