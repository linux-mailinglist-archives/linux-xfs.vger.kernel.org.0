I noticed xfs/132 test failing when I had changed the code to have 32-bit
xattr extent counter. The corresponding mount failure was due to log size
checks failing in xfs_log_mount(). The difference in value returned by
xfs_log_calc_minimum_size() => xfs_log_get_max_trans_res() =>
xfs_log_calc_max_attrsetm_res() was pretty large.

Upon code inspection I found the inconsistencies in
xfs_log_calc_max_attrsetm_res() which are described in the cover letter and as
part of the commit message of the last patch.

After a quick chat with Dave on irc, we figured that the best approach was to
convert xfs_attr_calc_size() into a helper function so that the size
calculations for an xattr set operation is placed in a single function. These
values can then be used by other functions like xfs_attr_set() and
xfs_log_calc_max_attrsetm_res().

Along the way, I found that the mount time reservation was incorrectly done as
well. For E.g. dabtree splits getting accounted as part of mount time
reservation was wrong. Due to these reasons and others listed in the cover
letter I ended up changing the mount time and run time reservation
calculations.

Hence, The reduced reservation sizes are actually a side effect of fixing the
inconsistencies.

I think you are right. I will keep the bmbt calculations separate for dabtree
and remote blocks and add them up at the end of the function.
