Yes, I know. An AA deadlock couldn't happen in this situation because
it's not the same inode, so it's just a lockdep false positive warning.

Ok, memory reclaim may run in those places where GFP_NOFS is removed.
Some new lockdep false positive warnings may appear. I hope this report
can help you eradicate them in the future.

Thanks for your reply. :)
