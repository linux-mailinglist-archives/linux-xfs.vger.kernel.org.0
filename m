Hi Yi,

Yep, that is my understanding of how the revalidation thing works in
general as well. The nuance in this particular case is that no folio
exists at the associated offset. Therefore, the reval is skipped in
iomap_write_begin(), iomap_zero_iter() skips over the range as well, and
the operation carries on as normal.

Have you tried the test sequence above? I just retried on latest master
plus this series and it still trips for me. I haven't redone the low
level analysis, but in general what this is trying to show is something
like the following...

Suppose we start with an unwritten block on disk with a dirty folio in
cache:

- iomap looks up the extent and finds the unwritten mapping.
- Reclaim kicks in and writes back the page and removes it from cache.
  The underlying block is no longer unwritten (current mapping is now
  stale).
- iomap_zero_iter() processes the associated offset. iomap_get_folio()
  clears FGP_CREAT, no folio is found.
- iomap_write_begin() returns -ENOENT (i.e. no folio lock ->
  iomap_valid()). iomap_zero_iter() consumes the error and skips to the
  next range.

At that point we have data on disk from a previous write that a
post-write zero range (i.e. truncate) failed to zero. Let me know if you
think this doesn't match up with the current series. It's been a while
since I've looked at this and it's certainly possible I've missed
something or something changed.

Otherwise, I think there are multiple potential ways around this. I.e.,
you could consider a fallback locking mode for reval, explicit (large?)
folio recreation and invalidation (if non-dirty) over unwritten mappings
for revalidation purposes, or something like the POC diff in reply to
hch on patch 3 around checking cache prior to iomap lookup (which also
has tradeoffs). I'm sure there are other ideas as well.
