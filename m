If we add a blocking lock invocation at the beginning of eof blocks reaper,
then fsfreeze would get blocked at cancel_delayed_work_sync().

However using a trylock, "eof blocks reaper" would return back due to failure
in obtaining the lock and hence it is guaranteed that fsfreeze will make progress.

Hence the changes are logically correct.
