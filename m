Ooo goody, ok, will do this next.

The following patches are on my radar to look into for this set. I have
yet to look into dependencies, so the set may grow. If the sgid tests
still fail after these ptaches, I will continue hunting for more fixes
to include in this set.

  e014f37db1a2 xfs: use setattr_copy to set vfs inode attributes
  472c6e46f589 xfs: remove XFS_PREALLOC_SYNC
  fbe7e5200365 xfs: fallocate() should call file_modified()
  0b02c8c0d75a xfs: set prealloc flag in xfs_alloc_file_space()
  2b3416ceff5e fs: add mode_strip_sgid() helper
  1639a49ccdce fs: move S_ISGID stripping into the vfs_*() helpers
  ed5a7047d201 attr: use consistent sgid stripping checks
  8d84e39d76bd fs: use consistent setgid checks in is_sxid()

In addition to the normal regression testing, I will specifically look
at the following tests for the sgid changes:

  generic/673
  generic/68[3-7]
  generic/69[6-7]

I will also do some extra runs on the entire perms group.

Let me know if you think something should be dropped or added.
