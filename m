/me smacks head, realizes that "fill" could be interpreted as an action
verb, instead of a noun.  "fullness" might have been better.

This function scans part of a btree's keyspace to determine the fullness
factor (empty, totally full, sparse).

xfs_rmapbt_keyspace_fullness ?
                   _sparseness?
		   _contiguity?

That's the best thing I can think of, though my brain is a little tired
right now.  I could even leave it as _has_record just to avoid the
rename costs, though "has records" is a little vague.

OTOH "keyspace" is one of those jargon terms that comes from database
theory land.

/me wishes he'd thought of "keyspace contiguity" earlier.

Though that's a lot of long words.  I'll take your suggestion to leave
the name as _has_records.  However, we're not actually measuring the
amount of *overlap* between records -- what we're really looking for is
the btree record equivalent of file holes.

enum xfs_btree_rec_contiguity?

Yes.

Generically, the _has_key_gap functions take two record keys A and C and
decide if is possible for there to be a third record key B satisfying
this relationship: A < B < C.  For the operation to make any sense, it's
very strongly implied that A is the high key of a record R and B is the
low key of a record S.  Technically, however, there's no reason why you
can't pass any two keys.

Now that I know that scrub is the only user of the key gap functions,
I'm confident that the function signatures can s/key1/high_key/ and
s/key2/low_key/.

Clearly I also need to improve the documentation for this function.

"Given two btree keys @high_key and @low_key, decide if it is possible
for there to be a third btree key K satisfying the relationship
@high_key < K < @low_key.  To determine the sparseness of the keyspace
for a pair of btree records, @high_key should be the high key of a
record and @low_key should be the low key of the next record in the
record set."

Not sure if that's any better though.

That's the (severe!) downside of talking to a database guy -- these
kinds of things are obvious to me, but that's not everyone's background.

Yeah.  Every time I squint at "< 0" "> 0" and have to remember what all

bc_ops->keys_contiguous()?  Sounds good to me.

Oops, I committed the correct code into the wrong patch.  Some times I
really hate stgit.  This has gotten better recently now that I figured
out how to dump the branch and patch name into PS1.

You've understood btree keyspace sparseness scanning correctly.
My apologies for making it harder than it had to be, and thanks for
wading through all this.
