Well, at bootup there's a runtime check that is done to every trace event
that is registered (an also on module load). It looks at the TP_printk
string for any dereference characters. If it finds one it then tests to
make sure the pointer points to something that would be in the ring buffer.
That is, if you have TP_printk("%pI", &__entry->saved_ip), that would be
OK. But if you had: TP_printk("%pI", __entry->ip_addr) it would trigger a
big WARN_ON() on boot.

See kernel/trace/trace_events.c: test_event_printk()

The difference is that you save more space on the ring buffer. Instead of
just allocating 256 bytes for every path, it will only allocate what is
need, plus 4 bytes of metadata. If most of your paths are less than 248
characters in length, you will likely get much better use out of the ring
buffer. That is, less dropped events.

Yeah, I was thinking that this was probably added before __string_len() was
added for this exact purpose.

I'll write the formal patch and test it too.
