I'd like to see an uniform option format too. When I write this patch,
I don't know which 'format' is *official*, so I have to choose one I prefer
personally. How to decide which one is better?

Another problem is, if we're going to make all these commands' format
to unify, it'll cause incompatible issue, for example xfstests has lots
of cases use xfs_io commands.

Thanks,
Zorro
