Fair, but I think that in the interest of time we should fix it up with a -1
which is consistent with the other bits of attr code first, then this can all
be cleaned up by making it a [] not [1], dropping the magical -1, turning
the macros into functions ala dir2, etc.

Sound ok?

Let me think on that a little more ;)
