Note that my idea is to just remove the fsnotify marks when the dentry
discards the inode.

That means that yes, the inode may still have a lifetime after the
dentry (because of other references, _or_ just because I_DONTCACHE
isn't set and we keep caching the inode).

BUT - fsnotify won't care. There won't be any fsnotify marks on that
inode any more, and without a dentry that points to it, there's no way
to add such marks.

(A new dentry may be re-attached to such an inode, and then fsnotify
could re-add new marks, but that doesn't change anything - the next
time the dentry is detached, the marks would go away again).

And yes, this changes the timing on when fsnotify events happen, but
what I'm actually hoping for is that Jan will agree that it doesn't
actually matter semantically.

Ahh - even better.

I didn't actually look very closely at the actual umount path, I was
looking just at the fsnotify_inoderemove() place in
dentry_unlink_inode() and went "couldn't we do _this_ instead?"

Yup. Honza?

(Aside: I don't actually know if you prefer Jan or Honza, so I use
both randomly and interchangeably?)

Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if it's just confused - it's very odd.

But I'd be perfectly happy just removing one use at a time - even if
we keep the s_inodes list around because of other users, it would
still be "one less thing".

Yeah, I think the inode lifetime is just so random these days that
anything that depends on it is questionable.

The quota case is probably the only thing where the inode lifetime
*really* makes sense, and that's the one where I looked at the code
and went "I *hope* this can be converted to traversing the dentry
tree", but at the same time it did look sensible to make it be about
inodes.

If we can convert the quota side to be based on dentry lifetimes, it
will almost certainly then have to react to the places that do
"d_add()" when re-connecting an inode to a dentry at lookup time.

So yeah, the quota code looks worse, but even if we could just remove
fsnotify and landlock, I'd still be much happier.
