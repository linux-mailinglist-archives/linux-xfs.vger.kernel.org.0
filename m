xfs_log_force_seq() passes flags from the caller to xlog_cil_force_seq()
(whereas this patch presumably wants it to pass XFS_LOG_SYNC
unconditionally). IOW, xfs_log_force(mp, 0) behavior is different from
xfs_log_force_seq(mp, seq, 0, ...).

I'm not proposing additional changes nor to rework the log force API.
I'm pointing out that I find this implementation to be extremely and
unnecessarily confusing. To improve it, I'm suggesting to either coopt
the existing async log force API...

... or if we really want a special async log force just for xfsaild (why
is still not clear to me), then tie it to an XFS_LOG_REALLY_ASYNC flag
or some such, pass that to the existing log force call, and document the
purpose/behavior of the new mode in detail. That at least won't require
a developer to wonder what !(flags & XFS_LOG_SYNC) happens to mean
depending on the particular log force function.
