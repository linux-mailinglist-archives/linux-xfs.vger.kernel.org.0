Yes, I did point that out.

No, please don't. I don't want random changes added to the test on
commit right now as I'm still actively working on it. I've said
twice now that this needs fixing (3 if you count this mention) and
that the test coverage also needs improving. If someone is still
working on the tests, then why make more work for everyone by making
unnecessary, unreviewed changes on commit?

That doesn't mean it can't be merged. It is a pain for mulitple
people to collaborate on a test that isn't merged because the test
number is not set in stone and chosing numbers always conflicts with
other tests under development. Getting the test merged early makes
knocking all the problems out of the test (and the code it is
testing!) much, much easier.

You built a broken kernel as it has none of the dependencies and bug
fixes that had already been committed to for-next for the new
functionality to work correctly. I posted a V3 patchset last night
and a published a git branch with all the kernel changes that you
can use for testing if you want.

I did - the failures you see are expected from what you were
testing. i.e. the test ran just fine, the kernel code you were
running is buggy and you didn't update xfsprogs so logprint
supported the new log types, hence the test (correctly) reported
failures.

Cheers,

Dave.
