Yeah, bit of a hack to allocate a shell transaction and attach the relog
ticket managed by the earlier patch, but it ended up cleaner than having
the transaction allocated and passed into this context.

See my earlier comment around batching. Right now we only relog one item
at a time and the relog reservation is intended to be the max possible
reloggable item in the fs. This needs to increase to support some kind
of batching here, but I think the prospective reloggable items right now
(i.e. 2 or 3 different intent types) allows a fixed calculation size to
work well enough for our needs.

Note that I think there's a whole separate ball of complexity we could
delve into if we wanted to support something like arbitrary, per-item
(set) relog tickets with different reservation values as opposed to one
global, fixed size ticket. That would require some association between
log items and tickets and perhaps other items covered by the same
ticket, etc., but would provide a much more generic mechanism. As it is,
I think that's hugely overkill for the current use cases, but maybe we
find a reason to evolve this into something like that down the road..

Oops, this refers to patch 1. I added the patch but forgot to remove the
comment, so this can go away..
