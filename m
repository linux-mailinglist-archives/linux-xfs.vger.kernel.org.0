*nod*

Yeah, that's something I'm trying to work towards by driving more
geometry information into the perag. I haven't tried to do the
bigger conversions yet because the perag isn't widely used enough
yet, and it's likely that there will be additional complexities with
the userspace code I haven't realised yet. Getting the allocation
code to pass around referenced perags is a big part of getting
there, but there's still plenty more to do before I think I'll be
able to tackle cleaning up the many unit conversion macros we have.

Cheers,

Dave.
