Is the transaction reservation space exhaustion caused by, as I
pointed out in another thread yesterday, the unbound concurrency in
IO completion? i.e. we have hundreds of active concurrent
transactions that then block on common objects between them (e.g.
inode locks) and serialise? Hence only handful of completions can
actually run concurrently, depsite every completion holding a full
reservation of log space to allow them to run concurrently?

1:2048 -> 1:256 is an 8x bump, yes?  Which means we'll get a 2GB log
on a 512GB filesystem, and the 220GB log you tested is getting a
~1GB log?

I also wonder if the right thing to do here is just set a minimum
log size of 32MB? The worst of the long tail latencies are mitigated
by this point, and so even small filesystems grown out to 200GB will
have a log size that results in decent performance for this sort of
workload.

Cheers,

Dave.
