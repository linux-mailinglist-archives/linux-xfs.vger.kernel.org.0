	In the short term -- I was dumping from a dumpdir
for a partition (just to make a copy of it on the new disk), but 
there was no real requirement to do so, so I just dumped from
the "source" dir, which for whatever reason didn't have the problem.

	My final try would have been to use rsync or such.

Not on that partition...
3.1.6?  Hasn't 318 been out for quite a while?

I looked through my bins only have 312 and 314 (and 318)...
tried 314, but it started out with the same inode confusion -- didn't
wait until it started spitting out any other errors.

	No prob.  Hey, one thing else you might wanna fix in 
xfsdump/restore that was fixed in xfs_fsr, is to 
put a posix_fadvise64(file->fd, offset, len, POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED)
before the read in xfsdump and on the write in xfs_restore.

	That way they'll let go of memory and won't end up
with pegged memory through-out the 'copy' - unless it is already
there, and then I have some other problem :-( .  But used all
8M of my swap (normally doesn't swap at all), shows a cpu
load of 3.4, and over 100% in wait-state.

	Just a hopeful suggestion.  I _think_ Dave put the
call in xfs_fsr (it would clear out memory everytime it ran, like
xfsdump/restore does now ;^)).


Thanks again for the possible cause...
