Thanks for fixing that up. I had tried to use rcu_init like Dave originally
had, and I like that better in general, but I had trouble with it - I guess
maybe it gets redefined based on memory model magic and the actual symbol
"rcu_init" maybe isn't available? I didn't dig very much.

Also, dumb question from me - how do we know where we need the
rcu_[un]register_thread() calls? Will it be obvious if we miss it
in the future?  "each thread must invoke this function before its
first call to rcu_read_lock() or call_rcu()."

Thanks,
-Eric
