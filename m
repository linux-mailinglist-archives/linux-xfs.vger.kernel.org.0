If I can't make head or tail of the problem you are describing,
exactly how am I supposed to respond? If I'm unable to get my point
across, I'd much prefer to spend my time on patches than on going
around in circles. I'm not interested in winning arguments. I'm not
interested in spending lots of time discussing theoretical problems
with the current set of fixes that don't exist once the root cause
we've already identified is fixed. My time is much better spent
fixing that root cause...

Keep in mind that I also have a lot of different, complex  things
going on at once that all require total focus while I'm looking at
them, so it can take days for me to cycle through everything and get
back to past topics. Delay doesn't mean I haven't read your response
or taken it on board, it just means I don't have time to write a
-meaingful response- straight away.

Which implies that the log has less than 25% of space free because
we've issued a push, and that the distance we push is bound by the
log head.

has an empty AIL. IOWs, you are creating the situation where the CIL
has not been allowed to run and hence has violated the >50% log size
limit on transactions. This goes away once we prevent the CIL from
doing this.

Ok, so what you see here is somewhat intentional, based on the fact
that the LSN used for items is different to the LSN used for the
commit record (start of commit vs end of commit).  We don't want to
push the currently commiting items instantly to disk as that defeats
the "delayed write" behaviour the AIL uses to allow efficient
relogging to occur.

The next commit will do a similar push during with the new
l_last_sync_lsn, which causes the target to point at the new
last_sync_lsn and so all the items in the AIL from the previous
commit that haven't been relogged (pinned) in the current commit
will get pushed. i.e. commit N will cause commit (N - 1) to get
pushed.

This will continue while we are in a situation where the current log
head location is limiting the push target and we are completely out
of log reservation space. Once we get to the point where the
physical head of the log is more than 25% of the log away from the
tail, the push target will stop being limited by the l_last_sync_lsn
and we'll go back to triggering push target updates via the tail of
the log moving forwards as we currently do.  IOWs, this "log head
pushing" behaviour is likely only necessary for the first 2-3 CIL
commits of a workload, then we fall back into the normal tail
pushing scenario.

AFAICT, what you are showing requires delaying of the CIL push to the
point it violates a fundamental assumption about commit sizes, which
is why I largely think it's irrelevant.

Right, if we do run out of log space, the log reservation tail
pushing mechanisms takes over and does the right thing.

CIL pushing is not actually serialised. Ordered, yes, serialised,
no. ANd stalling an iclog with a commit record should not cause the
log to fill completely - the next CIL push when it overflows should
get it moving long before the log runs out of reservation space.

Dave.
