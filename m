...and just to undercut my own statements, it seems that CONFIG_LOCKDEP
got turned on somehow between a kernel from a couple of days ago and
when I rebuilt it with the new patches.  The overall fstests slowdowns
are more on the level of 3.6 to 3.7h and 2.8 to 2.9h, though the runtime
increases of the fsfreeze loop tests are about the same.
