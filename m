Following the information provided by Darrick I still wanted to understand
the "+0914" timezone offset.  I've done some research and it turns out that
prior to 1 February 1895 the time zone in this part of the world really was
UT+0914 (or, to be entirely accurate, UT+0914.5) [1].  In those days noon
was defined to be the time that sun was directly overhead, hense the
odd-ball timezone.  The "+0914" timezone reported in the year-1800 case is
therefore correct.
