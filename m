Oh, it doesn't take much when the log is small. In this case, it's
3600 blocks in size - ~14MB, so 1% of the log is 140kB and that's
smaller than a single itruncate transaction reservation. The CIL
push threshold is ~1.7MB, and the push threshold is ~3.5MB. IOWs,
we might not push the cil the first time until it reaches 1.8MB
because of the size of the last transaction that pushes it over.
Then it gets pushed, leaving the last iclog waiting and pinning
that part of the log.

AFAICT, it's largely caused by the fact that transaction
reservations require significant single digit percentages of the
total log space. i.e. we're fine at 23%, next reservation requires
3% of the total log space, and then we're in trouble.

AFAICT, the problem is actually related to log sizes, so we have to
consider that as an aspect of the problem...

The problem with dropping the AIL lock and issuing and waiting for
log IO in the grant head wait loop is that it subverts the FIFO
waiting nature of the log reservations. i.e. first into the wait
code is the first woken. If we put a blocking log force in here,
the transaction reseration that triggers it now has to wait for
that to complete before it goes onto the wait queue, and there might
be a bunch more transactions that get in before it.

That also brings up the problem of thundering herd log forces.
Every concurrent transaction reservation that sees this state will
issue a log force before it goes to sleep waiting for space to be
made available. And every time they are woken and there's no space
available, they'll issue a log force. This will substantially
perturb behaviour when we are running in constant tail-pushing
workloads (i.e. all the time on small logs). That's why I suggested
the XFS_TRANS_SYNC mechanism so it didn't perturb the non-blocking
nature of the AIL push....

The difference is moving it to the AIL doesn't perturb the
transaction reservation waiting behaviour at all, and it's largely
indepedent on the log size, transaction reservation sizes, etc.

Logic might be:

	if the push target is approximately where the log grant tail
			pushing threshold should be; and
	if the AIL is empty or all the items in the AIL are > grant
			push threshold; and
	if we've got nothing else to do and will go to sleep

		issue a log force

i.e. I don't think we need to put any new code into the log
reservation side of things - all the triggers we need to handle this
in the AIL are already there...

__xfs_log_force_lsn() takes a CIL lsn, not a log LSN, so this
doesn't work the way you thought it does. i.e. __xfs_log_force_lsn()
pushes on the CIL first, then syncs the iclog buffers. Indeed, if
this was to be used, we wouldn't even need XFS_LOG_SYNC, because all
we need to do is start the IO on all the iclog buffers, and the log
forces do that. XFS_LOG_SYNC() only waits for them all to complete,
it doesn't change the way they are written.

Largest problme with this is that the CIL flush is a blocking
operation. Same as if we just replaced this with xfs_log_force(0)
to just push the CIL and the iclogs to disk...

Cheers,

Dave.
