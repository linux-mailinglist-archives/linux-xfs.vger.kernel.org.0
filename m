One file per <cough> tenant, and multiple threads spread across all the
tenants on a system.  This means that all the threads can end up
pounding on a single file, or each thread can write to a single file.
The scenario that generated all those numbers (I think) is opening the
file O_DIRECT|O_SYNC and pwrite()ing blocks at EOF.

Assuming you got 800 from the 400 writers + 400 bmbt allocations, yes.
Though I wouldn't count /quite/ that high for bmbt expansions.

Yes, I know, I've been battling $internalgroups for over a year now to
get extent size hints turned on for things like append logs and VM
images.  If the IO sizes get larger (or they turn on extent size hints)
then the heat goes down...

I know!  But right now the default log size you get with a 220G volume
is 110MB.  An 800MB log just pushes the scaling problems around the
system, but on the plus side the latency is no longer so high that the
heartbeat timers trip, which causes node evictions, which leads to even
/worse/ escalations from customers whose systems experience high rates
of failure.  Every single customer who escalates this causes another
round of bug reports and another round of meetings for me, even though
the causes and the bandaids are the same.

I'm going to drop this patch, because I don't have the strength to push
back against you /and/ Eric.  I'm once again in a crunch because I've
spent so much of the past few weeks in meetings about bugs that I didn't
have time to try out Allison's LARP patches so I basically have nothing
to push for 5.18 because we're past -rc6 and it's too late, too late for
anything.  Hell, I can't even get that capable() thing reviewed, and
(right now) that's causing me even more meetingsgalore pain.

Is it so dangerous to turn this on so that real users can experiment
with the new setting?

Frankly I'm also thinking about throwing away six years of online repair
work because I just don't see myself being able to summon the mental
energy to run the review process when simple things are this hard.
Every week I sit down and ask myself if I really have what it takes to
keep going, and I've reached the point where the answer is NO.  I was
really hoping that some of our discussions about process improvements
would have made things better, but instead I realize that I have failed
as maintainer.
