Yes, that's the sysfs file that exports the current value of
q->limits.discard_granularity.

Yes. But that's not the same on every device. My local nvme SSDs
give:

$ cat /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/discard_granularity
512
$

So the disk has a granualrity of 1 sector or 512 bytes. Hence fstrim
will try to trim right down to single filsystem block free spaces by
default.

I know why now - see below. It's the same reason the strace is hung.
It took 2 days for fstrim to progress to an AG that had active inode
freeing going on in it.

That's 250GB of free space in 1 million extents spread across 31
AG btrees. Not a huge deal for the filesystem, but for trim on
a really slow block device....

That's likely showing how the allocator uses locality for related
inodes.  The underlying locality algorithm will give files in the
same directory the same target AG.  So if you have a directory with
100 100GB files in them, they will largely all be allocated from AGs
target to target + 10. When you reflink and overwrite, the overwrite
allocations  will also get targetted to the same locality, and so
you'll get lots of small extents allocated across the same AGs, too.
When you then remove one of the reflinked files, only the overwrites
unique to that copy are freed, and now you get new small free spaces
in amongst largely full AGs. DO taht often enough, and you get a
significant number of small free spaces occurring.

IIRC, you last problem was one directory with 50 highly reflinked
files totalling 29TB of capacity - the above is pretty much the sort
of allocation and free space patterns I'd expect to see for that
pattern of data storage....

Yup.

And that's the problem right there.

What is the value for the underlying ceph rbds? That will tell us
if this number comes from the ceph rbds or the dm layers you have
above the ceph rbds. What are you using for thin provisioning? Is
that the dm layer (dm-thin) or something you are getting from the
ceph rbds?

FWIW, the 1TB nvme drive I mentioned above?

$ cat /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/discard_max_bytes 
2199023255040
$ echo $(((2**32 - 1 ) * 512))
2199023255040
$

That can handle one sector short of 2TB per discard, which I think
is the maximum the nvme protocol allows in a single discard
operation. IOWs, I can issue a single discard request to free the
entire device.

Yes. these are largely empty AGs - most of them have more than half
their space in one large contiguous free extent. And this will be
why the strace appears hung - discarding a single AG full of free
space (1TB) will be done as 250,000+ individual discard operations.

So that's something like 55 million discards for the ~220TB of free
space you have in that filesystem....

As to the strace that has hung - the discard loop has this in it:

                if (fatal_signal_pending(current)) {
                        error = -ERESTARTSYS;
                        goto out_del_cursor;
                }

So if you ctrl-c the fstrim and we are doing discards on small free
spaces, it should abort almost straight away.  However, if we've
issued a single discard for an entirely empty AG - we've called
blkdev_issue_discard() with a 1TB length.  blkdev_issue_discard()
does the slice and dice into device length and aligned discards,
and it has no checks for signals in it's main loop.

So strace/fstrim are stuck until those 250,000+ discards are issued
and completed - however many hours that will take. I suspect that
we should push a signal check into blkdev_issue_discard() and
friends.

If you've got a recent iostat on your system:

$ iostat -dxyzm 5

You can see what sort of progress the discards are making.
