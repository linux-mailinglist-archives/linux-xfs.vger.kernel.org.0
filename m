Also, I found a problem with xfs/534 when it does the direct write tests
to a pmem volume with DAX enabled:

looking at the xfs_bmap output for $testfile shows:

/opt/testfile:

Which is ... odd since the same direct write gets cut off after writing
to block 7 (like you'd expect since it's the same function) when DAX
isn't enabled...

...OH, I see the problem.  For a non-DAX direct write,
xfs_iomap_write_direct will allocate an unwritten block into a hole, but
if the block was already mapped (written or unwritten) it won't do
anything at all.  For that case, XFS_IEXT_ADD_NOSPLIT_CNT is sufficient,
because in the worst case we add one extent to the data fork.

For DAX writes, however, the behavior is different:

	if (IS_DAX(VFS_I(ip))) {
		bmapi_flags = XFS_BMAPI_CONVERT | XFS_BMAPI_ZERO;
		if (imap->br_state == XFS_EXT_UNWRITTEN) {
			force = true;
			dblocks = XFS_DIOSTRAT_SPACE_RES(mp, 0) << 1;
		}
	}

This tells xfs_bmapi_write that we want to /convert/ an unwritten extent
to written, and we want to zero the blocks.  If we're dax-writing into
the middle of an unwritten range, this will cause a split.  The correct
parameter there would be XFS_IEXT_WRITE_UNWRITTEN_CNT.  Would you mind
sending a kernel patch to fix that?
