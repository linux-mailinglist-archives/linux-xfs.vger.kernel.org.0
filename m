Ahhh I completely misunderstood what you meant.
It's interesting. I also wanted to improve test coverage of fuse by running
fuse passthrough with xfstests.

That could make sense.
TBH, I never test overlay without ./check -overlay.
I only tried to avoid breaking this config in case people are still
using it. If someone is interested in making changes here they
need to test those non-standard configurations and make sure
they are not broken by these changes.

I am not a native English speaker myself, but I don't think this term
fits so well to describe what you mean.
Maybe "overlayed" fs sounds too overlayfs oriended, but it could describe
other fs.

I think it does make sense, but the complications are in the details,
so I'll need
to look closer at some examples and mainly need some developers or testers
of nfs/cifs/glusterfs to care about this.

I may get around to look at fuse passthrough as the first target and see
what benefits this could bring on top of standard fuse support [1]

Thanks,
