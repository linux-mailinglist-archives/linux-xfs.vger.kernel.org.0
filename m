I guess that can happen, sorry. I'll try to come out with computation
based on a floating point arithmetic. There should not be any
performance or actual precision problem.
(well actually I'll drop this line completely, no ratio will be
computed in the end)

OK, my bad. I'll fix that.

OK, maybe just one line "Discard in progress" is actually what users
need. The computing of % done was probably just overkill from my side.
Sorry about that.
