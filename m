From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

After fixing the tail_lsn vs cache flush race, generic/482 continued
to fail in a similar way where cache flushes were missing before
iclog FUA writes. Tracing of iclog state changes during the fsstress
workload portion of the test (via xlog_iclog* events) indicated that
iclog writes were coming from two sources - CIL pushes and log
forces (due to fsync/O_SYNC operations). All of the cases where a
recovery problem was triggered indicated that the log force was the
source of the iclog write that was not preceeded by a cache flush.

This was an oversight in the modifications made in commit
eef983ffeae7 ("xfs: journal IO cache flush reductions"). Log forces
for fsync imply a data device cache flush has been issued if an
iclog was flushed to disk and is indicated to the caller via the
log_flushed parameter so they can elide the device cache flush if
the journal issued one.

The change in eef983ffeae7 results in iclogs only issuing a cache
flush if XLOG_ICL_NEED_FLUSH is set on the iclog, but this was not
added to the iclogs that the log force code flushes to disk. Hence
log forces are no longer guaranteeing that a cache flush is issued,
hence opening up a potential on-disk ordering failure.

Log forces should also set XLOG_ICL_NEED_FUA as well to ensure that
the actual iclogs it forces to the journal are also on stable
storage before it returns to the caller.

This patch introduces the xlog_force_iclog() helper function to
encapsulate the process of taking a reference to an iclog, switching
it's state if WANT_SYNC and flushing it to stable storage correctly.

Both xfs_log_force() and xfs_log_force_lsn() are converted to use
it, as is xlog_unmount_write() which has an elaborate method of
doing exactly the same "write this iclog to stable storage"
operation.

Further, if the log force code needs to wait on a iclog in the
WANT_SYNC state, it needs to ensure that iclog also results in a
cache flush being issued. This covers the case where the iclog
contains the commit record of the CIL flush that the log force
triggered, but it hasn't been written yet because there is still an
active reference to the iclog.

Note: this whole cache flush whack-a-mole patch is a result of log
forces still being iclog state centric rather than being CIL
sequence centric. Most of this nasty code will go away in future
when log forces are converted to wait on CIL sequence push
completion rather than iclog completion. With the CIL push algorithm
guaranteeing that the CIL checkpoint is fully on stable storage when
it completes, we no longer need to iterate iclogs and push them to
ensure a CIL sequence push has completed and so all this nasty iclog
iteration and flushing code will go away.
