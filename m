Frankly I've never understood what benefit we get from preallocating a
transaction and letting it twist in the wind consuming log space while
writeback pushes data to the disk.  It's perfectly fine to delay ioend
processing while we wait for unwritten conversions and cow remapping to
take effect, so what's the harm in a slight delay for this?

I guess it's an optimization to reduce wait times?  It's a pity that
nobody left a comment justifying why it was done in that particular way,
what with the freeze protection lockdep weirdness too.

What happens if you replace the call to xfs_setfilesize_ioend in
xfs_end_ioend with xfs_setfilesize, and skip the transaction
preallocation altogether?
