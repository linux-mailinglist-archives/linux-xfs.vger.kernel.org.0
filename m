I actually plumbed in this extra flag field because folks has asked me 
to preserve the finish calls where they appeared in the last review. 
Reason being that this changes behavior in that the transaction roll 
doesn't complete pending deferred operations.

?? if error is EAGAIN, we want to roll and continue, right?
And if it's 0 we roll and break.

Logic bugs aside, I think you meant something pretty close to the v5 
version.

Sure that's fine if folks think that is more clear.  At this point I 
feel like I have enough of it in my head, it's more about whether it 
makes sense to other people.  I agree the paraphrasing it equivalent.

It would if there was a subroutine using the state machine, but we dont 
have that in this case, so it actually doesn't have an effect.  It was 
asked for in one of the reviews, I assumed because people found it 
appropriate to set it at that time, sort of like a witness mark.  It 
doesnt hurt anything to do so, but you are right in that it is a 
duplicate.

xfs_attr_rmtval_unmap is the association in this case. 
DAS_RMTVAL_REMOVE is appropriate if folks prefer.

It is.  If you prefer to only keep one, I would stick with this one 
because this is the specific case that really needs it.  Also I think 
having them there helps to mark which of the returns are sort of the 
"jump out" points

It sounds like you're pretty much understanding it.  If that extra state 
set was confusing, then perhaps it should go.  Anyway, how about the 
following commentary:

/*
  * Enum values for xfs_delattr_context.da_state
  *
  * These values are used by delayed attribute operations to keep track
  * of where they were before they returned -EAGAIN.  A return code of

No, at this point a value of 0 does not mean anything.  It will later 
when we get into delayed attrs.  Delayed attrs are slightly different in 
that args (and the state machine) need to get set up after the "ping 
pong" has already started.  So we initialize on a state of 0, and have 
one more extra state (XFS_DAS_INIT) just to say that we did it, so dont 
initialize it again.  (See xfs_attr_finish_item from the git branch I 
sent earlier)

To further comment your interpretation, no, the routines do not execute 
any differently when the state is zero, or any other value they do not 
reconize.  They simply assume to "start from the begining" (ie: they 
simply fall through the switch statement) and over write the state as 
needed.

In fact, there are a few spots in the next patch when a child function 
gets a state reminicent of it's parent.  This condidtion is not an 
error.  It just means that the parent function was using it up until 
this point when it choose  to surrender the statemachine to the child 
function.  The child function has no notion of what its parents states 
even mean and pay no mind.  It is however the parents responsibility to 
reconize states of its child, and jump back to the child function to 
allow it to finish its tasks.

Hope that helps some :-)

Ok, do you prefer them not to be explicitly assigned?

Sure, will fix

That may remedy some of this.  I'll see if I can move it over.  Thanks 
for the review.
