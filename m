Maybe those should move to xfs_item_ops as they operate on a "live"
xfs_log_item? (they'd need to grow names clearly related to recovery
of course).  In fact except for slightly different calling convention
->cancel_intent already seems to be identical to ->abort_intent in
xfs_item_ops, so that would be one off the list.

Btw, it seems like we should drop the ail_lock before calling
->process_intent as all instances do that anyway, and it would keep
the locking a little more centralized, and it will allow killing
one pointless wrapper in each instance.  Maybe we can also move
the recovered flag to the generic log item flags?
