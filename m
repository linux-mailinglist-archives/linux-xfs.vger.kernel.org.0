I looked through the MM patches and other than the congestion thing they look
reasonable.  I think I can probably use this stuff to drop the use of the btree
inode.  However I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to add an explicit
backoff thing for heavy metadata dirty'ing operations.  Btrfs generates a lot
more dirty metadata than most, partly why my attempt to deal with this was tied
to using balance dirty pages since it already has all of the backoff logic.

Perhaps an explict balance_dirty_metadata() that we put after all metadata
operations so we have a good way to throttle dirtiers when we aren't able to
keep up?  Just a thought, based on my previous experiences trying to tackle this
issue for btrfs, what you've done already may be enough to address these
concerns.  Thanks,

Josef
