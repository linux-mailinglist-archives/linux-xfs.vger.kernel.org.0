Later on in the online fsck patch series, scrub will start using
LIVE_HOOKS for some of its scanning functionality.  I don't know that
anyone will really want to use online fsck on weird old systems like you
said, but while it's EXPERIMENTAL I don't want to lose the option
entirely.

That said, static branches do have a fallback for !HAVE_ARCH_JUMP_LABEL
case, which is raw_atomic_read.

I'll get rid of the srcu notifier chain xfs_hook implementation to
reduce the complexity within xfs.  Online fsck will always use static
branches + blocking rwsem notifiers.  For modern arches like x64 there
will be almost zero runtime cost due to the nop sled.  For m68k and
friends, they can kick the tires on xfs_scrub, but if the performance
sucks due to the READ_ONCE then oh well.
