Yeah.. I'm not bothered much by whether we retry once, 42 times or
forever. I think what this boils down to for me is whether it's worth
the risk of a behavior change of an -ENOSPC return causing something
unexpected for some random user or use case. Could we just do this in
two separate patches? Patch 1 fixes the calculation and targets stable,
patch 2 does whatever to the retry loop that potentially changes retry
semantics (and doesn't really need backporting)..?

Indeed..

Similar deal as above.. I'm more interested in a potential cleanup of
the code that helps prevent this sort of buglet for the next user of
->m_alloc_set_aside that will (expectedly) have no idea about this
subtle quirk than I am about what's presented in the free space
counters. ISTM that we ought to just ditch ->m_alloc_set_aside, replace
the existing xfs_alloc_set_aside() with an XFS_ALLOC_FS_RESERVED() macro
or something that just does the (agcount << 3) thing, and then define a
new xfs_alloc_set_aside() that combines the macro calculation with
->m_allocbt_blks. Then the whole "set aside" concept is calculated and
documented in one place. Hm?
