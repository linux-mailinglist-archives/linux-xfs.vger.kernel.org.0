Alrighty then, that sounds reasonable.  I try my best to recall history 
of the decisions just as a sort of guide of where we've been and where 
to go next.

Sort of, I think when we convert out of shortform, and we dont fit in a 
block, we skip over the leaf logic.  But the leaf_bp release should 
happen either way, so it cant belong to either state.

It is an implementation detail, it just sort of breaks up the if/else 
logic in this example.  So I just meant to point it out so that there 
isnt confusion as to why the next patch may not look quite like the 
pseudo code. Or unless I'm overlooking something?

Ok, I may fiddle around with some other arrangements or table it if I

You're right, I momentarily forgot I had added the flag memmber to hoist 
the defer finish out.  Yes, I think using it here would be appropriate. :-)

This seems reasonable, sorry for the earlier confusion.  On a side note 
though, a bit ago Dave had suggested we select a different acronym 
because "dac" is too easy to mix up with other existing schemes like dax 
;-)  I'm not super concerned about it right now because it's purely an 
asthetic thing, but eventuallly we probably should come up with 
something. :-)

I dont think it will be too complicated, and may be of use in the next 
phase of the series.  I will move forward with an init flag scheme in v9

No worries, I think some versions just have to become exploratory 
efforts for that reason.

Ok, I think the *_rename() helpers will help with the unnesting here. 
I'll put it together and see what folks think.

Thank you thank you thank you, for all your time and pateince with this, 
I know its super complicated and I really appreciate all the reviews!
