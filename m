Right, that's what I figured.

What I was thinking above was tying the reference to the lifetime of the
intents associated with the inode, not necessarily the full lifetime of
recovery. It's not immediately clear to me if that indirectly leads to a
similar chain of in-core inodes due to unusual ordering of dfops chains
during recovery; ISTM that would mean a deviation from the typical
runtime dfops ordering, but perhaps I'm missing something...

That aside, based on your description above it seems we currently rely
on this icache retention behavior for recovery anyways, otherwise we'd
hit this use after free and probably have user reports. That suggests to
me that holding a reference is a logical next step, at least as a bug
fix patch to provide a more practical solution for stable/distro
kernels. For example, if we just associated an iget()/iput() with the
assignment of the xfs_bmap_intent->bi_owner field (and the eventual free
of the intent structure), would that technically solve the inode use
after free problem?

BTW, I also wonder about the viability of changing ->bi_owner to an
xfs_ino_t instead of a direct pointer, but that might be more
involved than just adding a reference to the existing scheme...
