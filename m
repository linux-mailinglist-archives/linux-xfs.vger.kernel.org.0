When does this happen, exactly?  Are you saying that during log
recovery, we can end up replaying a delayed attr log item that hits
ENOATTR/EEXIST somewhere and passes that out, which causes log recovery
to fail?

...because as far as requests from user programs goes, we should be
doing all these precondition checks after allocating a transaction and
ILOCKing the inode, so that we can send the error code back to userspace
without cancelling a dirty transaction.

(I dunno, am I misunderstanding here?)
