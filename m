What was the error, specifically?  I would have though that recovery
would abort after "Encountered error and returned".  Does the recovery
somehow keep running and then finds the buf item in Trans B?

Or is the problem here that after the error, xfs submits the delwri
buffers?  And then the user tried to recover a second time, only this
time the recovery attempt reads Trans B, but then doesn't actually write
anything because the ondisk buffer now has the same LSN as Trans B?

<confused>
