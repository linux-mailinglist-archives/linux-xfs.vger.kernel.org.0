Agreed.  Given that kernel tolower() behavior has been stable since 1996
(and remaps the ISO 8859-1 accented letters), the "ASCII CI" feature
most closely maps to "ISO 8859-1 CI".  But at this point there's not
even a shared understanding (Dave said latin1, you said 7-bit ascii,
IDGAF) so I agree that documenting the exact transformations in the
manpage is the only sane way forward.

I propose the changing the mkfs.xfs manpage wording from:

"The version=ci  option  enables  ASCII  only case-insensitive filename
lookup and version 2 directories. Filenames  are  case-preserving, that
is, the names are stored in directories using  the  case  they  were
created with."

into:

"If the version=ci option is specified, the kernel will transform
certain bytes in filenames before performing lookup-related operations.
The byte sequence given to create a directory entry is persisted without
alterations.  The lookup transformations are defined as follows:

0x41 - 0x5a -> 0x61 - 0x7a
0xc0 - 0xd6 -> 0xe0 - 0xf6
0xd8 - 0xde -> 0xf8 - 0xfe

This transformation roughly corresponds to case insensitivity in ISO
8859-1 and may cause problems with other encodings (e.g. UTF8).  The
feature will be disabled by default in September 2025, and removed from
the kernel in September 2030."

It *seems* to operate on ISO 8859-1 (aka latin1), but Linus implied that
the history of lib/ctype.c is lost to the ages.  Or at least 1996-era
mailing list archives.
