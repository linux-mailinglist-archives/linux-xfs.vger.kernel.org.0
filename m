Well, the second part is broken.  The first part is fine, and I've briefly
consulted with a firmware team implementing such a feature.  It just needs
to make sure to return zeroes right after the return of the discard
even if the blocks aren't erased yet, including after a powerfail.
(anyone who knows the XFS truncate / hole punch code will have a vague
idea of how that could work).

True.  I have to admit I stopped reading the patch after the unmap
description.  I'll take another look.
