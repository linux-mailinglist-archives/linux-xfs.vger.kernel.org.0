I'm not sure.  Of the three filesystems that both have a ->sync_fs
function and implement FS_IOC_SHUTDOWN, xfs and f2fs look like they
passes errors like they should.

ext4 is another story -- curiously, if the fs is shut down, it'll return
0 and it doesn't check the return value of dquot_writeback_dquots.  I
don't remember enough of ext to know if that's deliberate or merely an
age-old artifact of the Bad Old Days when that whole code path didn't
care about errors.
