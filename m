AFAICT, there's no real memory corruption problem here; it's just that
the compiler treats array[1] as a single-element array instead of
turning on whatever magic enables it to handle flexarrays (aka array[]
or array[0]).  I don't know why you'd ever want a real single-element
array, but legacy C is fun like that. :/
