b_bn is supposed to only be an internal cache index these days. We
need that index in the first cacheline of the struct xfs_buf for
performance reasons (so traversals fetch only a single cacheline per
level), so perhaps a rename is in order just to catch all these
remaining users that shouldn't be using it...
