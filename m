So if you make the pretty print mount point a new variable and pass
that first this would become say:

	xfs_scrub -p /home -b /tmp/scrub

ad should still be fine.  OR am I missing something?

But scrub has by definition full access to the fs as it's scrubbing
that.  But I guess that access is in the kernel code, which we trust
more than the user space code?
