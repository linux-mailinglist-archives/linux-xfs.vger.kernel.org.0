I'm not 100% sure, either, but....

Yeah, I suspect that it is the xfs_bmse_merge() case freeing blocks
the reservation is for, and I agree that it should only happen on
the first shift because all the others that are moved are identical
in size and shape and would have otherwise been merged at creation.

Hence I think we can probably kill the xfs_bmse_merge() case,
though it might be wrth checking first how often it gets called...

Not here. Seems like the right approach to me. SO for the original
patch:
