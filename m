If by 'big stuff' you mean the MF_MEM_PRE_REMOVE patch, then yes, I
agree that it's too late to be changing code outside xfs.  Bumping that
to 6.8 will disappoint Shiyang, regrettably.

The patchsets for realtime units refactoring and typechecked rt-helpers
(except for the xfs_rtalloc_args thing) I'd prefer to land in 6.7 for a
few reasons.  First, the blast radii are contained to the rtalloc
subsystem of xfs.  Second, I've been testing them for nearly a year now,
I think they're ready from a QA perspective.

The third selfish reason for wanting to get the xfs realtime stuff off
my plate is that my goal for 6.8 is to try to eliminate the indirect
->iomap_begin/end calls from iomap.  It'll be helpful for me to be able
to focus exclusively on that since I'd really like your help making sure
I do the transition correctly. :)
