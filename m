I also tried running directly against a file on xfs (no qcow2, no VMs)
but it doesn't really matter whether I use --ramp_time=5 or 60.

Here are the results:

|---------------+-------+-------|
| preallocation |   xfs |  ext4 |
|---------------+-------+-------|
| off           |  7277 | 43260 |
| fallocate     |  7299 | 42810 |
| full          | 88404 | 83197 |
|---------------+-------+-------|

I ran the first case (no preallocation) for 5 minutes and I said there's
a peak during the first 5 seconds, but then the number remains under 10k
IOPS for the rest of the 5 minutes.
