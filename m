I see the problem, but I don't think this is the right way to fix
it.  The CIL context lock is already a major contention point in the
transaction commit code when it is only taken once per
xfs_trans_commit() call.  If we now potentially take it once per
intent item per xfs_trans_commit() call, we're going to make the
contention even worse than it already is.

The current sequence is always available from the CIL itself via
cil->xc_current_sequence, and we can read that without needing any
locking to provide existence guarantees of the CIL structure.

So....

bool
xfs_log_item_in_current_chkpt(
	struct xfs_log_item *lip)
{
	struct xfs_cil	*cil = lip->li_mountp->m_log->l_cilp;

	if (list_empty(&lip->li_cil))
		return false;

	/*
	 * li_seq is written on the first commit of a log item to record the
	 * first checkpoint it is written to. Hence if it is different to the
	 * current sequence, we're in a new checkpoint.
	 */
	return lip->li_seq == READ_ONCE(cil->xc_current_sequence);
}

Cheers,

Dave.
