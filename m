Dear Friend,
Reply Urgent

Please pardon the abruptness of this letter. However strange or
surprising this message might seem to you as we have not met
personally or had any dealings with you in the past. I must apologize
for intruding into your privacy.

I am Mr. Ahmed Zango, Working with a reputable bank here in Burkina
Faso as the manager in audit department. During our last banking
audits we discovered an abandoned account belongs to one of our
deceased customer, a billionaire businessman.

Meanwhile, before i contacted you i have done personal investigation
in locating any of his relatives who knows about the account, but i
came out unsuccessful. I am writing to request your assistance in
transferring Sum of $19.300.000.00 (Nineteen million Three Hundred
Thousand United State Dollars) into your account.

I decided to contact you to act as his foreign business partner so
that my bank will accord you the recognition and have the fund
transfer into your account. When i receive your quick respond the more
details information will be forwarded to you.

I am expecting to read from you as soon as possible you receive this message.

Best Regards
Mr. Ahmed Zango.
