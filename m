The pointer check does nothing to actually prevent memory
corruption. It only catches problems after we've already memcpy()d
off the end of the iclog in the previous loop. So if the last region
overruns the log, then it won't be triggered.

And, well, we've already checked and asserted that the copy is going
to fit entirely within the current iclog, so checking whether the
pointer has overrun outside the iclog buffer is both redundant and
too late.  Hence I removed it...

Yes, it's entirely contrived to make it possible to split this code
out in a simple fashion to ease review of the simple, fast path case
this code will end up with. The next patch changes all this context
and the parameters passed to the function, but this was the only way
I could easily split the complex xlog_write() rewrite change into
something a little bit simpler....

Cheers,

Dave.
