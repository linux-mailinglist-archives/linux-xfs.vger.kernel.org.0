Darrick and I talked about this offline a bit yesterday, and I think
we reached an understanding/agreement on this .... 

While this patch will solve the problem of low warning thresholds
rendering timer thresholds useless, I'm still of the opinion that
this is not a feature to fix, but an inadvertent/broken behavior to
remove.

The concept of a warning limit in xfs quota has been documented as
unimplemented for about 20+ years. Digging through ancient IRIX docs,
the intent may have been to warn once per login session
(which would make more sense with the current limit of 5.) However,
nothing can be found in code archives to indicate that the warning
counter was ever bumped by anything (until the semi-recent change in
Linux.)

This feature is still documented as unimplemented in the xfs_quota
man page.

And although there are skeletal functions to manipulate warning limits
in xfs_quota, they cannot be disabled, and the interface differs from
timer limits, so is barely usable.

There is no concept of a "warning limit" in non-xfs quota tools, either.

There is no documentation on what constitutes a warning event, or when
it should be incremented.

tl;dr: While the warning counter bump has been upstream for some time
now, I think we can argue that that does not constitute a feature that
needs fixing or careful deprecation; TBH it looks more like a bug that
should be fixed by removing the increment altogether.

And then I think we can agree that if warning limits hae been documented
as unimplemented for 20+ years, we can also just remove any other code
that is related to this unimplemented feature.

I /think/ that's more or less where Darrick and I ended up on this one.

If I misremembered or misrepresented anything, Darrick, please correct me :)

Thanks,
-Eric
