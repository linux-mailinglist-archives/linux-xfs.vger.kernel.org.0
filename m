The perag refactoring is already mostly reviewed and the changes are
simpler, so knock the rest of them out first.

The CIL series already has all the seperable changes up to patch 11
reviewed, so they can be merged without further review work.

The next chunk in that patch set is up to patch 25 (or is it 26?),
but I think there's only 4-5 patches in that set that are not yet
reviewed. That would be the next set to look at.

The rest of the patchset is the scalabilty stuff which probably is
going to be too much at this point, so we can leave it off to the
next cycle (when I'll put out another 20-30 patches I already have
on top of this with it...)

Yep, we'll get that sorted out. There's no disagreement on where we
want to end up, just on how we get there :P

I recommend just staying with static limits to start with. This is
"good enough" to solve the immediate problems, and we can look for
more optimised solutions once we've merged the initial fixes...

Cheers,

Dave.
