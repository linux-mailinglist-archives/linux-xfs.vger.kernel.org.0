I'm good with that - we're already long past the point where we try
to support XFS on every linux platform. Indeed, we've recent been
musing about making XFS depend on 64 bit only - 32 bit systems don't
have the memory capacity to run the full xfs tool chain (e.g.
xfs_repair) on filesystems over about a TB in size, and they are
greatly limited in kernel memory and vmap areas, both of which XFS
makes heavy use of. Basically, friends don't let friends use XFS on
32 bit systems, and that's been true for about 20 years now.

Our problem is the test matrix - if we now have to explicitly test
XFS both with and without large folios enabled to support these
platforms, we've just doubled our test matrix. The test matrix is
already far too large to robustly cover, so anything that requires
doubling the number of kernel configs we have to test is, IMO, a
non-starter.

That's why we really don't support XFS on 32 bit systems anymore and
why we're talking about making that official with a config option.
If we're at the point where XFS will now depend on large folios (i.e
THP), then we need to seriously consider reducing the supported
arches to just those that support both 64 bit and THP. If niche
arches want to support THP, or enable large folios without the need
for THP, then they can do that work and then they get XFS for
free.

Just because an arch might run a Linux kernel, it doesn't mean we
have to support XFS on it....

-Dave.
