No.  All the above are flags, not alternatives.  (and reading futher
you actually properly document it below).

I would not call this an overload.  It is a somewhat quirky encoding
that actually works pretty well for the use case.

No. The XFS_IFEXTENTS meaning did not change at all in that commit.
Even before a lot of code looked at XFS_IFEXTENTS and if it wasn't
set called xfs_iread_extents, XFS_IFEXTIREC was only used internally
for the in-memory indirection array and was completely unrelated to the
on-disk format.

No, that was not the case, even historically.  btree based inodes
already existed for more than 10 years when commit 0293ce3a9fd1
added XFS_IFEXTIREC to singinify the in-memory indirect extent
array.

I strongly disagree.  If we want to clean this up the right thing is
to remove XFS_IFINLINE and XFS_IFBROOT entirely, and just look at the
if_format field for the extent format.
