<facepalm>

Ah, another game of ye olde "blame the filesystem because it's the
first to complain"...

Which means it probably requires a bunch of other RCU magic to be
done by other part of the system to trigger it...

No need, won't be able to read it anyway because facepalm...

Actually, what if we just rate limit the calls? Once a second would
probably do the trick just fine - after the first few seconds
there'll be no space left to reclaim, anyway...
