So this:

@@ -753,7 +753,13 @@ xfs_inode_mark_reclaimable(
 	spin_unlock(&ip->i_flags_lock);
 	spin_unlock(&pag->pag_ici_lock);
 
-	if (flush_inodegc && flush_work(&pag->pag_inodegc_work.work))
+	/*
+	 * XXX: throttling doesn't kick in until work is actually running.
+	 * Seeing overruns in the thousands of queued inodes, then taking

+	 */
+	if (flush_inodegc && flush_delayed_work(&pag->pag_inodegc_work))
 		trace_xfs_inodegc_throttled(pag, __return_address);
 
 	xfs_perag_put(pag);

Brings the unlink workload runtime down from 3m40s to 3m25s,
indicating that the throttling earlier does seem to have some
effect. It's kinda hard to really measure effectively because of all
the spinlock contention in the CIL, but it does also reduce the
userspace latencies to about 2.5-2.7s.

Dropping the backlog to 8192 (from 65536) gets rid of all the
visible stuttering in the rm -rf workload, and brings the runtime
down to 3m15s. So it definitely looks to me like smaller backlog
queue depths are more efficient but not enough by themselves to
erase the perf regression caused by added lock contention...

I'll keep digging on this - I might, at this point, just work from
the base of my CIL scalability patchset just to take the CIL lock
contention out of the picture altogether....

Cheers,

Dave.
