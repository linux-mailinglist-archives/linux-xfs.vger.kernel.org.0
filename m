Yes. I have verified this. I will fix this in the next revision such 
that if the new number of blocks results in the (new) tail AG having < 
XFS_MIN_AG_BLOCKS, then the shrink operation should fail with an 
-EINVAL. Thank you for pointing this out. I will add an fstest test case 
too for this when I will send the patch series for xfstests.
