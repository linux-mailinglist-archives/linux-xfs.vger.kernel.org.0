Hmm.. well I didn't really consider this a bug upstream. The above is
more historical reference to an issue that has since gone away, but
trying to use the bug report on a stable kernel to be forward looking
about improving on potentially awkward behavior of the latest upstream
kernel under the same sort of circumstances (i.e. reclaim while frozen).

I suppose something like this would be potentially useful for stable
kernels that don't include background inactivation. I haven't audited
which stable kernels might fall in that category (if any), but alas it
probably doesn't matter because this patch likely wasn't going anywhere
anyways.
