Oops, yes, you are correct.  The first free inode is 5847, not 5856 as

It looks reasonable, but the patch needs to have a Signed-off-by tag
with your name and email (per kernel patch submission rules[1]) before
I can proceed with review.

This patch seems to have been line wrapped.  Would you mind resending it
with the DCO tag I mentioned above, and without wrapping?  Or as a text
attachment if that's the only option?
