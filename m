One of the annoying things we do when looking at the disassembly is
spend a lot of instructions shuffling arguments around.  Passing as many
arguments as possible in a struct minimises that.  Ideally we'd pass
the iomap_iter to iomap_begin() and iomap_end().  Agreed passing the
ops there makes no sense, but I'd like to keep inode and flags in
the iomap_iter struct so they don't need to be passed to begin/end
as explicit arguments.

I'm inclined to go with seg_len and op_len.

Yeah; this was just a quick hack.  I'll do something neater.
