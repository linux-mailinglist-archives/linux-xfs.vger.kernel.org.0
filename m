 *** Usage after quotarm ***
-core.nblocks = 0
-core.nblocks = 0
+core.nblocks = 1
+core.nblocks = 1

xfs/106:

-User quota are not enabled on SCRATCH_DEV
+User quota state on SCRATCH_MNT (SCRATCH_DEV)
+  Accounting: ON
+  Enforcement: OFF
+  Inode: #131 (2 blocks, 2 extents)
+Blocks grace time: [3 days 01:00:00]

xfs/220:
