Sure, but a shutdown can still happen at any point so this is just a
duplicate branch to maintain.

I think you're misreading me. I'm not suggesting to fake state changes.
I'd argue that's actually what the special case shutdown branch does.
And to the contrary, this patch already implements what I'm suggesting,
it's just not consistent behavior..

First, we basically already go from whatever state we're in to "logical
CALLBACK" during shutdown. This is just forcibly implemented via the
IOERROR state. With IOERROR eventually removed, this highlights things
like whether it's actually safe to make some of those arbitrary
transitions. It's actually not, because going from WANT_SYNC -> CALLBACK
is a potential use after free vector of the CIL ctx (as soon as the ctx
is added to the callback list in the CIL push code). This is yet another
functional problem that should be fixed before removing IOERROR, IMO
(and is reproducible via kasan splat, btw). At this point I think some
of these shutdown checks associated with CALLBACK are simply to ensure
IOERROR remains persistent once it's set on an iclog. We don't need to
carry that logic around if IOERROR is going away.

SYNCING -> CALLBACK is another hokey transition in the existing code,
even if it doesn't currently manifest in a bug that I can see, because
we should probably still expect (wait for) an I/O completion despite
that the filesystem had shutdown in the meantime. Fixing that one might
require tweaks to how the shutdown code actually works (i.e. waiting on
an I/O vs. running callbacks while in-flight). It's not immediately
clear to me what the best solution is for that, but I suspect it could
tie in with fixing the problem noted above.

With regard to this patch, consider that shutdown can happen at any
point and xlog_state_do_iclog_callbacks() cycles icloglock. That means
that as of this patch, we actually can go from IOERROR -> DIRTY and
possibly from DIRTY -> ACTIVE depending on where the iclog lies in the
list. Removing IOERROR will subtley change that behavior yet again to
make the latter transition potentially more likely.

Note that I think that's probably fine. What I'm suggesting is to just
drop the duplicate shutdown branch and instead lets evaluate whether
some of the code these checks intend to avoid is really problematic. I
don't think it is in the completion path since we're just resetting
in-core headers and such. That means we could probably just let the
iclogs fall through those state transitions naturally, reduce the number
of shutdown checks splattered throughout the code and simplify the
overall error handling logic in the process by handling all iclogs
consistently during shutdown.

That's not quite enough IMO. I think the whole IOERROR problem is not
primarily a matter of mechanically factoring it out. It's fragile
functionality that should be fixed/simplified first before there's any
real value to removing IOERROR.
