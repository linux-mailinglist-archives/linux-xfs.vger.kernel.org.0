Ok.

That seems reasonable as a cleanup, but I'm not sure how critical it is
otherwise. We've already handled the iclog at that point, so we're
basically just changing the function to return an error code regardless
of the fact that we ran xlog_sync() (which doesn't care about iclog
state until we attempt to write, where it checks state again before bio
submission) and that most callers have their own IOERROR state checks up
the chain anyways because there is no other indication of I/O submission
failure..
