I _think_ Kaixu brought this up briefly in looking at the previous
version of this patch. From a code standpoint, I agree that this path
seems like the most logical fit, but my understanding was that the
canenter thing is kind of an inconsistent and unreliable mechanism at
this point. IIRC, we've explicitly removed its use from the create path
to work around things like block reservation overruns leading to fs
shutdowns as opposed to digging into the mechanism and fixing whatever
accounting was broken. See commit f59cf5c299 ("xfs: remove
"no-allocation" reservations for file creations"), for example. I
believe the discussion around that patch basically concluded that the
complexity of maintaining/debugging the canenter path wasn't worth the
benefit of squeezing every last block out of the fs, but that was a
while ago now.

That aside, I don't have a strong opinion on the best way to fix this
particular deadlock problem. The only other thing (outside of
reliability) I might question with the canenter approach is whether it
has ever been used in situations outside of -ENOSPC, and if not, whether
there's any potential performance impact of invoking it more frequently.
