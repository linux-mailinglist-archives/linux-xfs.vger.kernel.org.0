So a weird thing here is that I think your logs show the xfs_growfs command
happening immediately after mount, and it doesn't have any size specified, 
so I can't tell if the intent was to shrink - but I don't think so:

Mar  6 19:59:21 tdm kernel: XFS (md1): EXPERIMENTAL online shrink feature in use. Use at your own risk!


We issue the EXPERIMENTAL message if the block delta is <= 0 (I'm not sure why
it's done if delta == 0 and I wonder if it should instead be < 0).

But maybe unraid isn't really trying to shrink, it's just doing an unconditional
growfs post-mount to ensure it's using the whole device (unnecessary, but should
be safe.)

I'm wondering if we have some path through xfs_growfs_data_private() that calculates
a delta < 0 unintentionally, or if we get there with delta == 0 and generate the
warning message.

However, if I recreate a filesystem with exactly your geometry:
# mkfs.xfs -b size=4096 -dfile,name=fsfile,agcount=32,size=4394581984b,su=4k,sw=32  -m inobtcount=0,bigtime=0
meta-data=fsfile                 isize=512    agcount=32, agsize=137330687 blks
         =                       sectsz=512   attr=2, projid32bit=1
         =                       crc=1        finobt=1, sparse=1, rmapbt=0
         =                       reflink=1    bigtime=0 inobtcount=0
data     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=4394581984, imaxpct=5
         =                       sunit=1      swidth=32 blks
naming   =version 2              bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0, ftype=1
log      =internal log           bsize=4096   blocks=521728, version=2
         =                       sectsz=512   sunit=1 blks, lazy-count=1
realtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0

and then mount it and point xfs_growfs at it with no args, I get no errors.
So I am still stumped...
