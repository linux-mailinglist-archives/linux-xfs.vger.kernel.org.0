Nothing - they are incomplete as metadump aborted at when it got
that error.

That has the XFS_SB_FEAT_INCOMPAT_NEEDSREPAIR bit set...

.... which is a result of xfs_repair 6.5.0 crashing mid way through
repair of the filesystem. Your kernel is too old to recognise the
NEEDSREPAIR bit. You can clear it with xfs_db like this:

Run this to get the current field value:

# xfs_db -c "sb 0" -c "p features_incompat" <dev>

Then subtract 0x10 from the value returned and run:

# xfs_db -c "sb 0" -c "write features_incompat <val>" <dev>

But that won't get you too far - the filesystem is still corrupt and
inconsistent. By blowing away the log with xfs_repair before
actually determining if the problem was caused by a RAID array
issue, you've essentially forced yourself into a filesystem recovery
situation.

Ok, so they don't actually have a BBU on board - it's an option to
add via a module, but the basic RAID controller doesn't have any
power failure protection. These cards are also pretty old tech now -
how old is this card, and when was the last time the cache
protection module was tested?

Indeed, how long was the power out for?

The BBU on most RAID controllers is only guaranteed to hold the
state for 72 hours (when new) and I've personally seen them last for
only a few minutes before dying when the RAID controller had been in
continuous service for ~5 years. So the duration of the power
failure may be important here.

Also, how are the back end disks configured? Do they have their
volatile write caches turned off? What cache mode was the RAID
controller operating in - write-back or write-through?

What's the rest of your storage stack? Do you have MD, LVM, etc
between the storage hardware and the filesystem?

Yup. Keep in mind that we do occasionally see these old LSI
hardware raid cards corrupt storage on power failure, so we're not
necessarily even looking for filesystem problems at this point in
time. We need to rule that out first before doing any more damage to
the filesystem than you've already done trying to recover it so
far...

Well, that's a last resort. But if your raid controller is unhealthy
or the volume has been corrupted by the raid controller the
ufsexplorer won't help you get your data back, either....

Cheers,

Dave.
