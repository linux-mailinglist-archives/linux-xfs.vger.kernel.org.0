I was starting to think about the optimal I/O size thing yesterday given
the latest feedback. I think it makes sense and it's probably easy
enough to incorporate, but if you're asking me about patch processing
logistics, IMO none of the changes or outstanding feedback since the v2
(inline w/ v1) are terribly important to fix the original problem.

Most of the feedback since v2 has been additive (i.e. "fix this problem
too") or surmising about inconsequential things like cond_resched()
usage or whether the threshold should be defined based on pages or not.
v2 used a large threshold to avoid things like risk of
unintended/unexpected consequences causing a revert down the line and
reintroducing the soft lockup problem, which is otherwise easily fixable
without significant change to functional behavior (given the current
worst case of unbound aggregation). So since you ask and after having
thought about it, if you're looking for a targeted fix to merge sooner
rather than later I think the smart thing to do is stick with v2 and
rebase the subsequent changes to reduce interrupt context latency and
general completion latency on top of that. (In fact, I probably should
have done that for v3.)
