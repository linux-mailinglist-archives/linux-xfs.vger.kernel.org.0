Er... what do you mean exactly by start and finish time?  The most
recent test?  The entire run?

From check:

	if [ -w /dev/kmsg ]; then
		export date_time=`date +"%F %T"`
		echo "run fstests $seqnum at $date_time" > /dev/kmsg
		...
	fi

From common/report:

	if [ -z "$date_time" ]; then
		date_time=$(date +"%F %T")
	fi

	...timestamp="${date_time/ /T}">

The "date_time" variable can be set by ./check just prior to starting
each test, but only if /dev/kmsg is a writable file.  If it's set, then
the timestamp in the xml file reflects the start time of the most recent
test.

If date_time is not set, then the timestamp in the xml file records the
point in time when the report is generated... which I suppose is a good
enough estimate if we failed to record date_time when the test was
started.

The junit xml schema says that the timestamp should be "when the test
was executed".  I think ./check ought to be setting date_time regardless
of /dev/kmsg.  ATM my test dashboard computes the difference between now
and the timestamp= attribute of the last report received to decide if it
should flag a test VM as possibly stalled.

Though to undercut everything I just wrote, the junit xml schema defines
testsuite and testcase as distinct entities and then refers to "the
test".

Given that fstests doesn't strictly follow that schema anyway, I guess
we can define the timestamp as we want, or add more timestamp
attributes?

<testsuite suite_timestamp="..." timestamp="..." report_timestamp="..."...>
