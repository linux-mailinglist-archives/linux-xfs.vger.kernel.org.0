Heh, I apparently never replied to this. :(

That sounds reasonable.

I think it would be fine, so long as we're careful with the if-then
chain.  Specifically:

a. If we dislike the rootino that we compute with the ondisk sunit value,
and...

b. The thing sb_rootino points to actually does look like the root
directory, and...

c. One of the secondary supers has an sunit value that gives us a
rootino calculation that matches the sb_rootino that we just checked
out...

...then we'll propose correcting the primary sb_unit to the value we
found in (c).

I'll throw that onto the V3 series.
