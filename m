yes

What do you think is missing? I didn't want to make too many changes
to fs which already use fs-verity and completely change the
interface, just to shift page handling stuff to middle layer
functions. So yeah kinda "step towards" only :)

There's the case when XFS also needs to invalidate multiple tree
blocks when only single one is requested. Same as ext4 invalidates
all blocks in the page when page is evicted. This happens, for
example, when PAGE size is 64k and fs block size is 4k. XFS then
calls fsverity_invalidate_range() for all those blocks; not just for
requested one.

I can rephrase this comment.

Thanks for all the spotted mistakes, I will fix them.
