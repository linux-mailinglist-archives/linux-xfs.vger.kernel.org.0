Ah, Ok. Yeah, I think that would be best so long as it is correct, since
right now at least we have separate xfs_attr_[set|remove]_args() loop
functions and I didn't see any code that warranted the extra roll in the
remove path.

>=20

I see, thanks. Hmmm... so I think that particular example is basically a
programming pattern thing moreso than a functional requirement. I.e.,
the current _clearflag() function clears the flag and rolls the
transaction perhaps simply so it can be reliably used in different
contexts. The use in the _addname() case is functionally spurious afaict
because we roll the transaction only to make no further changes and then
commit the final transaction in the higher level code.

I could see leaving the loop as is if this were the case for every exit
path back to xfs_attr_set_args(), but is that really the case? If not,
haven't we introduced a spurious roll for any zero return back to the
_args() function? I think it might be best to fix up the loop to not
roll on error =3D=3D 0, explicitly plumb in the -EAGAIN in those spurious
cases like _addname() where we currently roll, and then come up with a
follow up patch to remove the ones that end up as spurious. That way
we're not conflating too much refactoring with functional change and can
review/document the functional change independently (i.e., if removing
one of those rolls ends up introducing a bug, we don't have to revert an
entire refactoring patch to restore original behavior).

Now that I think of it, the better option is probably to remove the
xfs_trans_roll_inode() call from _addname() first, before these patches
introduce the delay ready infrastructure, since it's already isolated as
spurious at that point. That should be a simple patch with a
clear/obvious explanation.
