Fixed, though the other iget functions still open code this.

Why?  Is it because we presuppose that the caller holds the AGI buffer
and hence we only need a passive reference?

I wrote this much too long ago, back when reclaim actually could write
inode clusters to disk.

At this point the comment and the code are both wrong -- if the inode is
in IRECLAIM, then it's either being recycled or reclaimed.  Neither of
those things modify the ondisk buffers anymore, so we actually could
return ENODATA here because all three callers of this function use that
as a signal to read i_mode from the icluster buffer.

I think you're referring to the situation where an icreate calls
xfs_iget_cache_miss in the (v5 && IGET_CREATE && !ikeep) scenario,
in which case we don't get around to setting i_mode until
xfs_init_new_inode?

The icreate transaction holds the AGI all the way to the end, so a
different thread calling _is_allocated shouldn't find any inodes in this
state as long as it holds the AGI buffer, right?

How about I stuff it into fs/xfs/scrub/ instead?  The only reason it's
in xfs_icache.c is because I wanted to keep the rcu lock and radix tree
lookup stuff in there... but yes I agree it's dangerous to let anyone
else see this weird function.

Plus then I can require the caller pass in a valid AGI buffer to prove
they've serialized against icreate/ifree. :)
