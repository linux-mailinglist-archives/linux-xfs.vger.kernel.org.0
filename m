A bit more detail would be nice :)

Like, the inode timestamp has a range of slightly greater than 2^34
because 10^9 < 2^30. i.e.

Inode timestamp range in days:

$ echo $(((2**62 / (1000*1000*1000) / 86400) * 2**2))
213500
$

While the quota timer range in days is:
$ echo $(((2**34 / 86400)))
198841
$

There's ~15,000 days difference in range here, which in years is
about 40 years. Hence the inodes have a timestamp range out to
~2485 from the 1901 epoch start, while quota timers have a range
out to only 2445 from the epoch start.

Some discussion of the different ranges, the problems it might cause
and why we don't have to worry about it would be appreciated :)

Cheers,

Dave.
