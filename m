I think you overestimate the simplicity to somebody who doesn't have
context on whatever upcoming changes you have. I spent more time staring
at this wondering what the list filtering logic was for than I would
have needed to review the entire patch were those changes not included.

Note that I said "two or three" and then sent you a diff that breaks it
down into two. That addresses my concern.

Reapply the list filtering logic (reverting the same diff I already
sent) at the beginning of your upcoming series that uses it. I sent the
diff as a courtesy because you seem to be rather frustrated wrt to any
suggestion to change this series, but this seems like a standard case of
misplaced code to me with a simple fix. The fact that this is used
somehow or another in a series that is so far unposted and unreviewed is
not a valid justification IMO. I really don't understand what the issue
is here wrt to moving the changes to where they're used.
