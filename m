I was just thinking about that last night. I agree, thanks.

Hm, ok fair, let me give that more thought.

[ -i|r|x|F ] 

sounds exclusive but I don't think it's enforced. I think it was safe for

yeah, ugly isn't it. :) I definitely cringed at "isreadonly = EXCLSUSIVELY" -
wut?

And a pony. :) 

All good points, thanks.
