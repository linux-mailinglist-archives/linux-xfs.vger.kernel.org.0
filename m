Do we need to do all of this serialization and whatnot to set the
incompat bit? Can we just modify and log the in-core sb when or before
an incompatible item is logged, similar to how xfs_sbversion_add_attr2()
is implemented for example?

Ok, so here it looks like we log the superblock change and presumably
rely on the unmount sequence to write it back...

What happens if the modified superblock is written back and then we
crash during a quiesce but before the log is fully clean? ISTM we could
end up in recovery of a log with potentially incompatible log items
where the feature bit has already been cleared. Not sure that's a
problem with intents, but seems risky in general.

Perhaps this needs to be pushed further down such that similar to
unmount, we ensure a full/sync AIL push completes (and moves the in-core
tail) before we log the feature bit change. I do wonder if it's worth
complicating the log quiesce path to clear feature bits at all, but I
suppose it could be a little inconsistent to clean the log on freeze yet
leave an incompat bit around. Perhaps we should push the clear bit
sequence down into the log quiesce path between completing the AIL push
and writing the unmount record. We may have to commit a sync transaction
and then push the AIL again, but that would cover the unmount and freeze
cases and I think we could probably do away with the post-recovery bit
clearing case entirely. A current/recovered mount should clear the
associated bits on the next log quiesce anyways. Hm?
