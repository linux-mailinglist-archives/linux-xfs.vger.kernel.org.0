I'm not sure addresses the actual case that can cause this error.

i.e. the root inode is always the first inode in the "root chunk"
that is allocated at mkfs time. THat location is where repair will
always calculate it to be, and it will be the inode that it uses
to rebuild the root dir from.

The problem, as I understand it, is that we have a situation where
the per-ag btree root blocks have moved (due to split/merge) from
the their original location which is packed against the AG headers.
The root inode chunk is located at the lowest inode cluster aligned
block after these AG btree roots.

Once the btree roots have moved, they may be space between the AG
headers and the root inode chunk to allocate a new inode chunk,
in which case we have at least 64 inodes allocated underneath the
root inode. And if we have 64k blocks and 256 byte inodes, we could
have 256 inodes per fs block between the AG headers and the root
indoe chunk.

Hence scanning all the inodes in the first indoe chunk won't find
the root indoe if any of these situations has occurred, and we may
have to scan 1500 or more inodes in to find the root chunk (6 btree
roots - BNOBT,CNTBT,INOBT,FINOBT,RMAPBT,REFCBT - and 64k blocks).

So I think the best thing to do here is try to calculate the root
inode number as per xfs_repair, and then bulkstat that. i.e. see
the calculation of "first_prealloc_ino" in repair/xfs_repair.c
(about line 450). Probably requires a XFS_IOC_FSGEOMETRY_V1 call to
get the necessary info to calculate it...

Cheers,

Dave.
