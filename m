That sounds like a good idea - being able to config it out provides
a mechanism to isolate v4 only code paths over time....

Well, there's a difference between what a distro that heavily
patches the upstream kernel is willing to support and what upstream
supports. And, realistically, v4 is going to be around for at least
one more major distro release, which means the distro support time
window is still going to be in the order of 15 years.

However, with the way typical enterprise feature policies work, a
feature needs to be deprecated for a major release before it can be
removed.

So, realistically, the deprecation decision is not for the near term
- it's for dropping support in the "current + 2" major release that
nobody is even thinking about yet. i.e. if we don't deprecate it
in the next couple of years, then we'll still need to be
maintaining the v4 filesystem format in upstream for the next 15
years. Which, IMO, is about 10 years too long...

Cheers,

Dave.
