Maybe, maybe not. Storage tiering is a pretty hot subject, simply
shedding some light on this capability may give it more use. I didn't
know of any actual use case for RT in XFS since IRIX times, but if
there's a way to use it for tiering, this is indeed a very promising
area of development for me (and no doubt many others).
