 XFS (dm-0): Corruption detected. Unmount and run xfs_repair

After analyzing the disk image, it was found that the corruption was
triggered by the fact that extent was recorded in both the inode and AGF
btrees. After a long time of reproduction and analysis, we found that the
root cause of the problem was that the AGF btree block was not recovered.

Consider the following situation, Transaction A and Transaction B are in
the same record, so Transaction A and Transaction B share the same LSN1.
If the buf item in Transaction A has been recovered, then the buf item in
Transaction B cannot be recovered, because log recovery skips items with a
metadata LSN >= the current LSN of the recovery item. If there is still an
inode item in transaction B that records the Extent X, the Extent X will
be recorded in both the inode and the AGF btree block after transaction B
is recovered.

  |------------Record (LSN1)------------------|---Record (LSN2)---|
  |----------Trans A------------|-------------Trans B-------------|
  |     Buf Item(Extent X)      | Buf Item / Inode item(Extent X) |
  |     Extent X is freed       |     Extent X is allocated       |

After commit 12818d24db8a ("xfs: rework log recovery to submit buffers on
LSN boundaries") was introduced, we submit buffers on lsn boundaries during
log recovery. The above problem can be avoided under normal paths, but it's
not guaranteed under abnormal paths. Consider the following process, if an
error was encountered after recover buf item in transaction A and before
recover buf item in transaction B, buffers that have been added to
buffer_list will still be submitted, this violates the submits rule on lsn
boundaries. So buf item in Transaction B cannot be recovered on the next
mount due to current lsn of transaction equal to metadata lsn on disk.

  xlog_do_recovery_pass
    error = xlog_recover_process
      xlog_recover_process_data
        ...
          xlog_recover_buf_commit_pass2
            xlog_recover_do_reg_buffer  //recover buf item in Trans A
            xfs_buf_delwri_queue(bp, buffer_list)
        ...
        ====> Encountered error and returned
        ...
          xlog_recover_buf_commit_pass2
            xlog_recover_do_reg_buffer  //recover buf item in Trans B
            xfs_buf_delwri_queue(bp, buffer_list)
    if (!list_empty(&buffer_list))
      xfs_buf_delwri_submit(&buffer_list); //submit regardless of error

In order to make sure that submits buffers on lsn boundaries in the
abnormal paths, we need to check error status before submit buffers that
have been added from the last record processed. If error status exist,
buffers in the bufffer_list should be canceled.

Canceling the buffers in the buffer_list directly isn't correct, unlike
any other place where write list was canceled, these buffers has been
initialized by xfs_buf_item_init() during recovery and held by buf
item, buf items will not be released in xfs_buf_delwri_cancel(). If
these buffers are submitted successfully, buf items assocated with
the buffer will be released in io end process. So releasing buf item
in write list cacneling process is needed.
