From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

fstrim will hold the AGF lock for as long as it takes to walk and
discard all the free space in the AG that meets the userspace trim
criteria.i For AGs with lots of free space extents (e.g. millions)
or the underlying device is really slow at processing discard
requests (e.g. Ceph RBD), this means the AGF hold time is often
measured in minutes to hours, not a few milliseconds as we normal
see with non-discard based operations.

THis can result in the entire filesystem hanging whilst the
long-running fstrim is in progress. We can have transactions get
stuck waiting for the AGF lock (data or metadata extent allocation
and freeing), and then more transactions get stuck waiting on the
locks those transactions hold. We can get to the point where fstrim
blocks an extent allocation or free operation long enough that it
ends up pinning the tail of the log and the log then runs out of
space. At this point, every modification in the filesystem gets
blocked. This includes read operations, if atime updates need to be
made.

To fix this problem, we need to be able to discard free space
extents safely without holding the AGF lock. Fortunately, we already
do this with online discard via busy extents. We can makr free space
extents as "busy being discarded" under the AGF lock and then unlock
the AGF, knowing that nobody will be able to allocate that free
space extent until we remove it from the busy tree.

Modify xfs_trim_extents to use the same asynchronous discard
mechanism backed by busy extents as is used with online discard.
This results in the AGF only needing to be held for short periods of
time and it is never held while we issue discards. Hence if discard
submission gets throttled because it is slow and/or there are lots
of them, we aren't preventing other operations from being performed
on AGF while we wait for discards to complete...

This is an RFC because it's just the patch I've written to implement
the functionality and smoke test it. It isn't polished, I haven't
broken it up into fine-grained patches, etc. It's just a chunk of
code that fixes the problem so people can comment on the approach
and maybe spot something wrong that I haven't. IOWs, I'm looking for
comments on the functionality change, not the code itself....

+ * Notes on an efficient, low latency fstrim algorithm
+ *
+ * We need to walk the filesystem free space and issue discards on the free
+ * space that meet the search criteria (size and location). We cannot issue
+ * discards on extents that might be in use, or are so recently in use they are
+ * still marked as busy. To serialise against extent state changes whilst we are
+ * gathering extents to trim, we must hold the AGF lock to lock out other
+ * allocations and extent free operations that might change extent state.
+ *
+ * However, we cannot just hold the AGF for the entire AG free space walk whilst
+ * we issue discards on each free space that is found. Storage devices can have
+ * extremely slow discard implementations (e.g. ceph RBD) and so walking a
+ * couple of million free extents and issuing synchronous discards on each
+ * extent can take a *long* time. Whilst we are doing this walk, nothing else
+ * can access the AGF, and we can stall transactions and hence the log whilst
+ * modifications wait for the AGF lock to be released. This can lead hung tasks
+ * kicking the hung task timer and rebooting the system. This is bad.
+ *
+ * Hence we need to take a leaf from the bulkstat playbook. It takes the AGI
+ * lock, gathers a range of inode cluster buffers that are allocated, drops the
+ * AGI lock and then reads all the inode cluster buffers and processes them. It
+ * loops doing this, using a cursor to keep track of where it is up to in the AG
+ * for each iteration to restart the INOBT lookup from.
+ *
+ * We can't do this exactly with free space - once we drop the AGF lock, the
+ * state of the free extent is out of our control and we cannot run a discard
+ * safely on it in this situation. Unless, of course, we've marked the free
+ * extent as busy and undergoing a discard operation whilst we held the AGF
+ * locked.
+ *
+ * This is exactly how online discard works - free extents are marked busy when
+ * they are freed, and once the extent free has been committed to the journal,
+ * the busy extent record is marked as "undergoing discard" and the discard is
+ * then issued on the free extent. Once the discard completes, the busy extent
+ * record is removed and the extent is able to be allocated again.
+ *
+ * In the context of fstrim, if we find a free extent we need to discard, we
+ * don't have to discard it immediately. All we need to do it record that free
+ * extent as being busy and under discard, and all the allocation routines will
+ * now avoid trying to allocate it. Hence if we mark the extent as busy under
+ * the AGF lock, we can safely discard it without holding the AGF lock because
+ * nothing will attempt to allocate that free space until the discard completes.
+ *
+ * Hence we can makr fstrim behave much more like bulkstat and online discard
+ * w.r.t. AG header locking. By keeping the batch size low, we can minimise the
+ * AGF lock holdoffs whilst still safely being able to issue discards similar to
+ * bulkstat. We can also issue discards asynchronously like we do with online
+ * discard, and so for fast devices fstrim will run much faster as we can
+ * pipeline the free extent search with in flight discard IO.
