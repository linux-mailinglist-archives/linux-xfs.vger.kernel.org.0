  xfs: expanding delayed logging design with background material (2021-12-09 10:22:36 +1100)

----------------------------------------------------------------
xfs: CIL and log scalability improvements

xlog_write() is code that causes severe eye bleeding. It's extremely
difficult to understand the way it is structured, and extremely easy
to break because of all the weird parameters it passes between
functions that do very non-obvious things. state is set in
xlog_write_finish_copy() that is carried across both outer and inner
loop iterations that is used by xlog_write_setup_copy(), which also
sets state that xlog_write_finish_copy() needs. The way iclog space
was obtained affects the accounting logic that ends up being passed
to xlog_state_finish_copy(). The code that handles commit iclogs is
spread over multiple functions and is obfuscated by the set/finish
copy code.

It's just a mess.

It's also extremely inefficient.

That's why I've rewritten the code. I think the code I've written is
much easier to understand and there's less of it.  The compiled code
is smaller and faster. It has much fewer subtleties and outside
dependencies, and is easier to reason about and modify.

Built on top of this is the CIL scalability improvements. My 32p
machine hits lock contention limits in xlog_cil_commit() at about
700,000 transaction commits a section. It hits this at 16 thread
workloads, and 32 thread workloads go no faster and just burn CPU on
the CIL spinlocks.

This patchset gets rid of spinlocks and global serialisation points
in the xlog_cil_commit() path. It does this by moving to a
combination of per-cpu counters, unordered per-cpu lists and
post-ordered per-cpu lists, and is built upon the xlog_write()
simplifications introduced earlier in the rewrite of that function.

This results in transaction commit rates exceeding 2 million
commits/s under unlink certain workloads, but in general the
improvements are smaller than this as the scalability limitations
simply move from xlog_cil_commit() to global VFS lock contexts.
