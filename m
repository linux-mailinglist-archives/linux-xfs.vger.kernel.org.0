Don't bother, we already had this discussion *five years ago*:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20180523044742.GZ23861@dastard/

The same points there still apply -- we cannot break existing V4 users,
the format is scheduled for removal, and it's *really unfair* for
megacorporations like Intel and Google to dump zeroday reproducers onto
public mailing lists expecting the maintainers will just magically come
up with engineering resources to go fix all these corner cases.

Silicon Valley tech companies just laid off what, like 295,000
programmers in the last 9 months?  Just think about what we could do if
1% of that went back to work fixing all the broken crap.

Hire a team to triage and fix the damn bugs or stop sending them.
