Ok, it took me some time to get this to work reliably - the way was
full of landmines with little documentation to guide around them.

1. If multiple commands are needed to be run from nsexec, a helper
   script is needed (I called it check-helper).

2. You have to `mount --make-private /proc` before doing anything to
   make the mounts of /proc inside the pid namespace work correctly.
   If you don't do this, every other mount namespace will also see
   only the newest mount, and that means every runner but the last
   one to start with the wrong mount and PID namespace view in /proc.

3. if you get the system into the state described by 1), unmounting
   /proc in each runner then races to remove the top /proc mount.
   Many threads get -EBUSY failures from unmount, leaving many stale
   mounts of /proc behind.

4. the top level shell where check-parallel was invoked is left with
   the view where /proc has been unmounted from a PID/mount
   namespace that has gone away. Hence /proc now has no processes or
   mounts being reported and nothing works until you mount a new
   instance /proc in that namespace.

5. After mounting proc again there are lots of mounts of stale /proc
   mounts still reported. They cannot be unmounted as the mount
   namespaces that created them have gone away and unmounting /proc
   in the current shell simply removes the last mounted one and we
   goto 4).

4. /tmp is still shared across all runner instances so all the

   concurrent runners dump all their tmp files in /tmp. However, the
   runners no longer have unique PIDs (i.e. check runs as PID 3 in
   all runner instaces). This means using /tmp/tmp.$$ as the
   check/test temp file definition results is instant tmp file name
   collisions and random things in check and tests fail.  check and
   common/preamble have to be converted to use `mktemp` to provide
   unique tempfile name prefixes again.

5. Don't forget to revert the parent /proc mount back to shared
   after check has finished running (or was aborted).

I think with this (current prototype patch below), we can use PID
namespaces rather than process session IDs for check-parallel safe
process management.

Thoughts?

-Dave.

check-parallel: use PID namespaces for runner process isolation

From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

This provides isolation between individual runners so that they
cannot see the processes that other test runners have created.
This means tools like pkill will only find processes run by the test
that is calling it, hence there is no danger taht it might kill
processes owned by a different test in a different runner context.
