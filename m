I don't recall being adamant that you use xfs_bmap_set_attrforkoff here;
I think I only didn't want forkoff setter functions getting scattered
all over the codebase.

Regardless of whatever I said for V1, now I can see what exactly that
looks like, and I don't like it.  xfs_bmap_set_attrforkoff is the
function you call to set forkoff when you want to set an xattr of a
particular size, and need to adjust forkoff.  We don't know what the
security xattr(s) are going to be yet, so this seems like a misuse of
that function.

Just do it the way Christoph said.

IRIX 6.2 was released what, 25 years ago?  Probably fine to just turn
that into a comment.

Agreed, the next fs to want this can hoist it.
