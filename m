Right, that's the oversight we need to correct. mkfs.xfs is already
setting it, so adding checks to the suerpblock verifier, repair, etc
isn't going to break anything.

No, it's not. The parent pointer feature bit it set, mkfs.xfs always
sets the ATTRBIT in that case, so the superblock feature bit checker
needs to error out if (PARENT | ATTRBIT) == PARENT.

This is basic on-disk format verification stuff, Darrick, and you
know this as well as I do.

Which is a classic demonstration of an oversight. We're not
omniscent, and hindsight is wonderful for making things we missed
obvious.

Also, xfs_repair failing to catch something doesn't mean the
behaviour is correct or good. It just means we failed to consider
that specific failure mode and so haven't added the code to catch
it. Fixing this sort of oversight is exactly why we have
EXPERIMENTAL tags....

But that's the issue: we should not be working around feature bit
bugs in core XFS code. PARENT is dependent on ATTRBIT being set, and
the whole point of our feature bit checks is to catch on-disk format
bugs like this at mount time. Ignoring the bad feature flag
combination and workign around them in core code is the antithesis
of the XFS on-disk format verification architecture.

The fact is that mount *should fail* if PARENT is set and ATTRBIT is
not. xfs_repair should flag this as an error and fix it. mkfs.xfs
has set both PARENT and ATTRBIT for a long long time, and so we
should be enforcing that config everywhere. We should not be working
around an invalid feature bit combination anywhere in the XFS code,
ever.

It's taken me a long time to calm down after reading these two
words.

One of the reasons we have an EXPERIMENTAL period for new features
is to provide scope for correcting on-disk format screwups like this
properly. This means we don't need to carry hacks around stupid
thinko's and straight out bugs in the on-disk format and initial
implementation forever.

We also work under the guidelines that it is largely the
responsibility of the engineer who asked for the new functionality
to be merged to do most of the heavy lifting to fix such issues
during the EXPERIMENTAL period.

Suggesting that someone else should do the work to tidy up the loose
on-disk format ends in the kernel and userspace in preference to a
one line hack that works around the problem goes against all the
agreements we've had for bringing experimental code up to production
quality. This isn't how to engineer high quality, robust long lived
code...

-Dave.
