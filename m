None of the dangerous_fuzz* tests have golden output.  I've thought
about posting the ones that are in my dev tree, but there's probably
not much point until I/we finish fixing the things that repair misses.
Ditto with scrub.

TBH I wrote all these field fuzzers solely as a means to fuzz things
systematically, and didn't think too hard about using them as regression
tests.  Back when I introduced the dangerous_norepair tests, it was
success enough if the kernel didn't crash.  I /think/ we've tightened
things up enough that it's time to move on to more careful checking for
runtime errors.

Hmm, seems reasonable.  The _scratch_fuzz_modify helper probably needs
to be modified to complain if the fs writes actually succeed.

I'd put this at the end of __scratch_xfs_fuzz_field_test, since there
are dozens of tests that use this function, not just xfs/456.

The long term goal is to make all the corruption bailouts report
themselves to the online health system so that userspace can query the
filesystem status (via xfs_spaceman) without having to scrape dmesg.
