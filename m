Oh no it doesn't! :)

I just debugged the persistent xfs/158 failure down to repair only
writing the secondary superblocks with "features_changed" is true.

xfs/158 trashes the repair process after setting the inobtcnt and
needrepair feature bits in the primary superblock. That's the only
code that sets the internal "features_changed" flag that triggers
secondary superblock writeback. If repair then dies after this it
won't get set on the next run without the upgrade options set on the
command line. Hence we re-run repair without the upgrade feature
being enabled to check that it still recovers correctly.

The result is that repair does the right thing in completing the
feature upgrade because it sees the feature flag in the primary
superblock, but it *never sets "features_changed"* and so the
secondary superblocks are not updated when it is done. It then goes
on to check NEEDSREPAIR in the primary superblock and clears it,
allowing the fileystem to mount again.

This results in secondary superblocks with in-progress set and
mis-matched feature bits, resulting in xfs_scrub reporting corrupt
secondary superblocks and so failing the test.

This change will probably mask that specific bug - it'll still be
lying their waiting to pounce on some unsuspecting bystander, but it
will be masked by other code detecting the feature mismatch that it
causes and correcting it that way...

Cheers,

Dave.
