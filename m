I don't agree that IFEXTENTS has two meanings.  This is what I
understand of how xfs_ifork fields and surrounding code are supposed to
work; can you point out what's wrong?

 1. xfs_ifork.if_format == XFS_DINODE_FMT_EXTENTS tells us if the fork
    is in extent format.

 2. (xfs_ifork.if_flags & XFS_IFEXTENTS) tells us if the incore extent
    map is initialized.

 3. If we are creating a fork with if_format == EXTENTS, the incore map
    is trivially initialized, and therefore IFEXTENTS should be set
    because no further work is required.

 4. If we are reading an if_format == EXTENTS fork in from disk (during
    xfs_iread), we always populate the incore map and set IFEXTENTS.

 5. If if_format == BTREE and IFEXTENTS is not set, the incore map is
    *not* initialized, and we must call xfs_iread_extents to walk the
    ondisk btree to initialize the incore btree, and to set IFEXTENTS.

 6. xfs_iread_extents requires that if_format == BTREE and will return
    an error and log a corruption report if it sees another fork format.

From points 3 and 4, I conclude that (prior to xfs-5.13-merge) IFEXTENTS
is always set if if_format is FMT_EXTENTS.

From point 6, I conclude that it's not possible for IFEXTENTS not to be
set if if_format is FMT_EXTENTS, because if an inode fork ever ended up
in that state, there would not be any way to escape.

Agreed, that's #4 above.

I don't agree.  I think #1 tells us "in extent format" and #2 tells us
"in memory"; and #3 and #4 are how we guarantee that.

<shrug> IMHO we initialized it trivially, but that's splitting hairs and
doesn't warrant further argument, so I'll move on.

Let's look at the relevant code in xchk_bmap(), since I wrote that
function:

	/* Check the fork values */
	switch (ifp->if_format) {
	...
	case XFS_DINODE_FMT_EXTENTS:
		if (!(ifp->if_flags & XFS_IFEXTENTS)) {
			xchk_fblock_set_corrupt(sc, whichfork, 0);
			goto out;
		}
		break;

The switch statement checks the format (#1), and the flag test checks
that the incore state (#3 and #4) hold true.  Perhaps it was unwise of
scrub to check *incore* state flags here, but as of the time the code
was written, it was always the case that FMT_EXTENTS and IFEXTENTS went
together.  Setting SCRUB_OFLAG_CORRUPT is how scrub signals that
something is wrong and administrator intervention is needed.

I agree with the code fix, but not with the justification.
