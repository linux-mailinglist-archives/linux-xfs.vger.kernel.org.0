I agree that the inline is nicer than the macro, but a transaction
reservation value seems misplaced to me in the IGEO. Perhaps having
something analogous to struct xfs_trans_resv might be more appropriate.

Regardless, I agree with Darrick on the backporting situation. The
original patch needs to be backportable to however many upstream stable
releases back to v3.16 and similarly for distro kernels. Either patch
might not be complex overall, but for somebody who might be processing
hundreds of backports across various subsystems refactoring things as
such in the same patch is clearly not equivalent to a one line change to
an otherwise unchanged line since the original commit. I'll post a patch
on top of this one to rework into an inline if people view that as
preferable to the macro.
