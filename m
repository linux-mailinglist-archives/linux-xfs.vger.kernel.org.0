Hmm.  It's hard to remember what I was thinking 15 minutes ago let alone
2 weeks ago, but I /think/ this is what I was driving at.  I agree with
your statement that this would find any free extent starting before
bbno, instead of a free extent *ending* as close as possible to bbno.

I now understand what this patch is trying to accomplish, and it looks
good to me, modulo whatever comment changes you want to make. :)

Ok, thanks.  That makes sense to me now.
