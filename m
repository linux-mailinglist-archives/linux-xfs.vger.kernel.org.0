Yes. And the linux kernel memory consistency model ask us to mark them,
see tools/memory-model/Documentation/access-marking.txt.

This fails painful at first, but I'd actually wish we'd have tools
enforcing this as strongly as possible as developers (well me at least)
seem to think a racy access is just fine more often than they should, and
needing an annotation and a comment is a pretty good way to sure that.

It's not really a "new bot".  It has been official memory consistency
policy for a while, but it just hasn't been well enforced.  For new code
asking if the review is racy and needs a marking or use READ_ONCE() and
WRITE_ONCE() has been part of the usual review protocol.  Reviewing old
code and fixing things we got wrong will take a while, but I'm actually
glad about more bots for that.
