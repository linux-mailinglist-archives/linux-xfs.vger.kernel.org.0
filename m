It does.  That beeing said I really much prefer the block based
interface from Andrey.  It is a lot cleaner and without weird page
cache internals, although it can still be implemented very nicely
by file systems that store the tree in the page cache.

Except for th magic swapper_spaces, and address_space without an
inode is not a thing, so you need to allocate an extra inode anyway,
which is what reclaim works on.
