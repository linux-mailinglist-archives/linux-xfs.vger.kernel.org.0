I should've noted that the "xfsprogs: refactor buffer function names"
series applies against 5.5; this series is a backport of the second half
of the kernel 5.6 merge.  I didn't send that part because I didn't feel
that it was significant enough to increase the patchbomb spew.

SO... the order is:

1. "refactor buffer function names", which is the thread before this one
2. "sync with 5.6", available at [1]
3. "make buffer functions return error codes", which is this one
