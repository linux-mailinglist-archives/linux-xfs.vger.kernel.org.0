Sure, but IO path allocations are done under GFP_NOIO context, which
means IO path allocations can't recurse back into filesystem reclaim
via direct reclaim. Hence there should be no way for an IO path
allocation to block on XFS inode reclaim and hence there's no
possible deadlock here...

IOWs, I don't think this is the deadlock you are looking for. Do you
have a lockdep report or some other set of stack traces that lead
you to this point?

Cheers,

Dave.
