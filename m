Yup, it was a quick "here's what it looks like" patch.

Yeah, there's heaps mor cleanups that can be done as a result of
this - e.g. xlog_write_done() and xlog_commit_record() should be
merged. The one caller of xlog_write() that does not provide a
commit_iclog variable shoudl do that call xlog_commit_record()
itself, then xlog_write() can just assume that always returns the
last iclog, etc....

Missed that...

Ah, yes, well spotted.

I need to move the call to xlog_write_start_rec() outside
the loop - it only needs to be written once per ticket, and we only
ever supply one ticket to xlog_write() now, and it is never reused
to call back into xlog_write again for the same transaction context.

I did say "compile tested only " :)
