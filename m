Hmm, maybe I'll try turning on lockdep for arm64 and see if it has
anythign interesting (ha!) to say.  Well, it /is/ a long holiday
weekend....

That reminded me that a month or two back I also saw this crash when
alwasycow is turned on and we start runnng generic/522:

So I wonder if this is the same kind of thing -- someone kreallocates
the iext leaf block without taking ILOCK, and now our poor thread here
walks off the dead leaf pointer in the cursor.

Or maybe this is a totally separate problem, who knows.  I've only seen
it twice in the last 6 months.

Hm.  I looked over the code for that, and it takes ILOCK_EXCL on both
inodes involved in the file contents exchange, and holds it past the
final transaction commit + defer chain processing.  So I don't think
it's there.
