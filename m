Hi Brian,

Thank you for your response.

Providing more details about configuration:

kernel: 4.14.99
xfsprogs: 4.9.0+nmu1ubuntu2
content of /etc/zadara/xfs.protofile is captured in [1]
mkfs output is captured in [2]

This is very critical for us to have a working repair in production. I
presume the same is true for most users.

Our use case is like this: during mkfs the overall system does not
know yet the exact sunit/swidth to be used. Also, the underlying
storage can change its sunit/swidth alignment as part of some storage
migration scenarios. During mount we already know the proper
sunit/swidth. But the problem is that in order to specify sunit/swidth
during mount, XFS superblock must be marked as "supporting data
alignment", i.e., XFS_SB_VERSION_DALIGNBIT has to be set. Otherwise,
XFS refuses to mount and says:

            xfs_warn(mp,
    "cannot change alignment: superblock does not support data alignment");
            return -EINVAL;

In order for the superblock to be marked like this, *some*
sunit/swidth need to be specified during mkfs.

xfs_info uses XFS_IOC_FSGEOMETRY to get the values, and this pulls the
values from the run-time copy of the superblock:

int
xfs_fs_geometry(
    xfs_mount_t        *mp,
    xfs_fsop_geom_t        *geo,
    int            new_version)
...
    if (new_version >= 2) {
        geo->sunit = mp->m_sb.sb_unit;
        geo->swidth = mp->m_sb.sb_width;
    }

So if during mount we have updated the superblock, we will pull the
updated values. If we do not update (as the proposed patch), we will
report the values stored in the superblock. Perhaps we need to update
the geomtery ioctl to report runtime values?

Thanks,
Alex.
