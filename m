Hi all,

Previously posted candidates for 5.10.y followed chronological release
order.

Parts 1 and 2 of fixes from v5.10..v5.12 have already been applied to
v5.10.121.

Part 3 (from 5.13) has already been posted for review [3] on June 6,
but following feedback from Dave, I changed my focus to get the same
set of patches tested and reviewed for 5.10.y/5.15.y.

I do want to ask you guys to also find time to review part 3, because
we have a lot of catching up to do for 5.10.y, so we need to chew at
this debt at a reasonable rate.

This post has the matching set of patches for 5.10.y that goes with
Leah's first set of candidates for 5.15.y [1].

Most of the fixes are from v5.15..v5.17 except for patch 11 (v5.18-rc1).
All fix patches have been tagged with Fixes: by the author.

The patches have been soaking in kdepops since Sunday. They passed more
than 30 auto group runs with several different versions of xfsprogs.

The differences from Leah's 5.15.y:
- It is 11 patches and not 8 because of dependencies
- Patches 6,7 are non-fixes backported as dependency to patch 8 -
  they have "backported .* for dependency" in their commit message
- Patches 3,4,11 needed changes to apply to 5.10.y - they have a
  "backport" related comment in their commit message to explain what
  changes were needed
- Patch 10 is a fix from v5.12 that is re-posted as a dependency for
  patch 11

Darrick,

As the author patches 4,11 and sole reviewer of patch 3 (a.k.a
the non-cleanly applied patches), please take a closer look at those.

Patch 10 has been dropped from my part 2 candidates following concerns
raised by Dave and is now being re-posted following feedback from
Christian and Christoph [2].

If there are still concerns about patches 10 or 11, please raise a flag.
I can drop either of these patches before posting to stable if anyone
feels that they need more time to soak in master.

Thanks,
Amir.
