I very much agree with Ted on that point.

As a user and big fan of both kdevops and fstests-bld I wouldn't
want to have to choose one over the other, not even to choose
a unified expunge list.

I think we are still at a point where this diversity makes our ecosystem
stronger rather than causing duplicate work.

To put it in more blunt terms, the core test suite, fstests, is not
very reliable. Neither kdevops nor fstests-bld address all the
reliability issue (and they contribute some of their own).
So we need the community to run both to get better and more
reliable filesystem test coverage.

Nevertheless, we should continue to share as much experience
and data points as we can during this co-opetition stage in order to
improve both systems.

Thanks,
Amir.
