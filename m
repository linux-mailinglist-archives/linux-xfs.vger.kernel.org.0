device name.  And there's nothing special about boot.

Bollocks.  Absolute root is ramfs or tmpfs and we do have mknod done
there.

Root filesystem is a complete red herring.

NO.  ->purpose should go away, not be extended.  And again, that
has fuck-all to do with rootfs.

For fsck sake...  It's where the first argument of mount(2) goes.
As in, "/dev/sda4" when you say mount -t xfs /dev/sda4 /mnt
Or "10.1.1.18:/srv/nfs/mirrors" in
mount -t nfs4 10.1.1.18:/srv/nfs/mirrors /home/mirrors/public \
	 -o rsize=8192,wsize=8192,proto=tcp,ro

Note that it's not in any real sense different from any other
option - its interpretation is entirely up to fs type.  The
only reason why it's separate is historical - way, way back
there had been no filesystem types and mount(2) got just
a block device pathname + mountpoint + one flag (ro/rw).
No (string) options either.  There has been a long and nasty
history, considerably older than Linux, including such things
as magical binary structures (each for its own fs type - check
how e.g.  OSF is doing that).

But accidents of calling conventions aside, device name is just
another fs option.  And device name is a misnomer - witness
what e.g. NFS is doing.  Keeping it special for new API
was pointless, so we have this in vfs_kern_mount():
        fc = fs_context_for_mount(type, flags);
        if (IS_ERR(fc))
                return ERR_CAST(fc);

        if (name)
                ret = vfs_parse_fs_string(fc, "source",
                                          name, strlen(name));
        if (!ret)
                ret = parse_monolithic_mount_data(fc, data);  
        if (!ret)
                mnt = fc_mount(fc);
        else   
                mnt = ERR_PTR(ret);

        put_fs_context(fc); 

and sys_mount() ends up passing the first argument as 'name' to
vfs_kern_mount().  That's it - nothing more to it.
