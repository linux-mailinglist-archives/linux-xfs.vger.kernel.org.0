Hi Zorro,

Please pull this branch with changes for fstests.

As usual, I did a test-merge with the main upstream branch as of a few
minutes ago, and didn't see any conflicts.  Please let me know if you
encounter any problems.

xfs/349: reclassify this test as not dangerous (2025-02-20 13:52:17 -0800)

----------------------------------------------------------------
fstests: fix online and offline fsck test groups [v32.2 02/22]

I've been working on online fsck for years, and hardening offline fsck
whenever I notice easy to fix discrepancies between the two tools.  Now
that it's been a couple of years since I've seen any problems, I think
it's time to open this to wider testing by dropping /some/ of the
"dangerous" tags.

While working on this I also noticed that some of the fuzz tests were
misclassified, so this patchset fixes those problems too.

With a bit of luck, this should all go splendidly.
