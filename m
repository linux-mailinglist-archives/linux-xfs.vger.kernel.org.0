The original "put the hash in the xattr name" patches did that, but I
discarded that approach because it increases the size of each parent
pointer by 4 bytes, and was really easy to make a verrrry slow
filesystem:

I wrote an xfs_io command to compute lists of names with the same
dirhash value.  If I created a giant directory with the same file
hardlinked millions of times where all those dirent names all hash to
the same value, lookups in the directory gets really slow because the
dabtree code has to walk (on average) half a million dirents to find the
matching one.

There were also millions of parent pointer xattrs, all with the same
attr name and hence the same hash value here too.  Doing that made the
performance totally awful.  Changing the hash to crc32c and then sha512
made it much harder to induce collision slowdowns on both ends like
that, though sha512 added a noticeable performance hit for what it was
preventing.

Hopefully the fact that the attr name starts with 12 bytes (4 of which
aren't known to unprivileged userspace) and omits the last 12 bytes of
the dirent name will make it harder to generate double-collisions.
Granted there's probably someone who's more math-smart than me who can
figure this out.
