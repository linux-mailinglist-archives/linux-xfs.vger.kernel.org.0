IIRC that doesn't work but I don't remember why - has to do w/ the ag code move,
and use in userspace IIRC. And TBH I forgot that "xfs_shared" was uhhhh actually
shared with the kernel and failed to check.

I'll figure something out.  Tired of pushing this stuff from file to file,
subdir to subdir ... was trying to avoid libfrog.

But thanks for noticing, Darrick - and sorry for missing it.
