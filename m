Hmm... so I ran fstests against this on an otherwise default V5
filesystem, and saw three new regressions:

xfs/125 spat out this from the final repair run:

Phase 1 - find and verify superblock...
Phase 2 - using internal log
	- zero log...
	- scan filesystem freespace and inode maps...
	- found root inode chunk
Phase 3 - for each AG...
	- scan (but don't clear) agi unlinked lists...
	- process known inodes and perform inode discovery...
	- agno = 0
attribute entry #32 in attr block 2, inode 134 is INCOMPLETE
problem with attribute contents in inode 134
would clear attr fork
bad nblocks 8 for inode 134, would reset to 0
bad anextents 4 for inode 134, would reset to 0
	- agno = 1
	- agno = 2
	- agno = 3
	- process newly discovered inodes...
Phase 4 - check for duplicate blocks...
	- setting up duplicate extent list...
	- check for inodes claiming duplicate blocks...
	- agno = 0
	- agno = 1
	- agno = 2
	- agno = 3
No modify flag set, skipping phase 5
Phase 6 - check inode connectivity...
	- traversing filesystem ...
	- traversal finished ...
	- moving disconnected inodes to lost+found ...
Phase 7 - verify link counts...
No modify flag set, skipping filesystem flush and exiting.
xfs_repair should not fail

And xfs/434 and xfs/436 both complained about memory leaks stemming from
an xfs_da_state that xfs/125 didn't free correctly:

From a quick bisect, all of thse problem originates in the last patch.
