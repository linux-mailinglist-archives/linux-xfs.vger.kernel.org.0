Huh, we're supposed to have already validated the data device size
is larger than the minimum supported before we try to align the Ag
sizes to the data dev geometry.

But trimming *should never happen* for single AG filesystems. If
we've got dblocks < minimum AG size for a single AG filesystem and
we are only discovering that when we are doing AG alignment mods,
then we've -failed to bounds check dblocks correctly-. We should
have errored out long before we get to aligning AG geometry.....

Yup, ok, see validate_datadev(), where we do minimum data subvolume
size checks:

        if (cfg->dblocks < XFS_MIN_DATA_BLOCKS) {
                fprintf(stderr,
_("size %lld of data subvolume is too small, minimum %d blocks\n"),
                        (long long)cfg->dblocks, XFS_MIN_DATA_BLOCKS);
                usage();
        }

.... and there's the bug:

#define XFS_MIN_DATA_BLOCKS     100

That's wrong and that's the bug here: minimum data device
size is 1 whole AG, which means that this should be:

#define XFS_MIN_DATA_BLOCKS(cfg)	XFS_AG_MIN_BLOCKS((cfg)->blocklog)

Cheers,

Dave.
