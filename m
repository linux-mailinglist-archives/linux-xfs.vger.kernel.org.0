Well, all the critical list_empty(&cil->xc_cil) checks are done
under the xc_push_lock, so I'd suggest that if we zero the counters
under the push lock when switching contexts, and put the initial
zero->non-zero counter transition to under the same lock we'll get
exact checks without requiring a spinlock/atomic in the fast
path and have all the right memory barriers in place such that races
can't happen...

test_and_set_bit() still locks the memory bus and so requires
exclusive access to the cacheline. Avoiding locked bus ops
(atomics, spinlocks, etc) in the fast path is the problem
I'm trying to solve with this patchset. IOWs, this isn't a viable
solution to a scalability problem caused by many CPUs all trying to
access the same cacheline exclusively.

Cheers,

Dave.
