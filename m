Ahh, I see -- sf_removename will /never/ kill i_afp if we're doing a
DA_OP_REPLACE or ADDNAME, and leaf_removename also won't do that if
we're doing DA_OP_REPLACE.  IOWs, only a removexattr operation can
result in i_afp being freed.

And the XATTR_CREATE operation always guarantee that i_afp is non-null
before we start, so xfs_attr_defer_add should never be called with
args->dp->i_afp == NULL, hence it'll never hit that state.

Would you mind adding a sentence to the comment?

"A pure create ensures the existence of i_afp and never encounters this
state."

FBO of maintainers who aren't quite as uptodate on how xattrs work? ;)

(Admittedly all this will probably go away if we stop freeing i_afp, but
I wasn't going to push on that until the LARP stuff settles...)
