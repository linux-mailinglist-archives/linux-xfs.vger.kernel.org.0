Right.. what I mean to ask is whether it's worth mentioning in the
comment we're adding here. ISTM it is, because the flag mitigation
strategy depends on being able to actually read the historically broken
inodes. At the very least, that tells somebody who might be cleverly
trying to get around the caveat in the comment that they might need to
consider the external code when making changes to the verifier.

The latter is more what I had in mind.. just filter out the bad state
in-core (perhaps with a one-shot warning to let the user know this fs
has the oddity) and let further modifications commit the change or not.
I agree that it's probably overkill to introduce a transaction to
persist a fix at read time where one does not already exist. But if
we're going to silently modify what's on-disk anyways, I'm not sure I
see a major problem with clearing it on read if it otherwise results in
the same behavior. I believe we used to convert old (v1) inodes to v2 in
a similar manner when read off disk into the in-core structure.

FWIW, the reason I ask in this case is just to see if we can achieve the
same desired behavior with less code. This seems like quite a rare case,
so I think it would be a slightly unfortunate to have code spread in
various places, including a non-trivial comment in the verifier, for
something that could potentially be isolated to a single bit of
filtering logic at or near the read verifier. Of course if I'm mistaken
about the potential simplification, then I don't have any major issue
with what the patch is currently doing..

Hmm.. that sounds reasonable in principle, but it's not clear to me if
you mean to combine that with the explicit propagation prevention or use
it in place of it. As above, I'm still curious if the implementation for
this behavior needs to be more involved than 1. prevent new bad
configurations in the ioctl path and 2. filter out the pre-existing bad
settings at read time and let them persist naturally.

Also if this is already more than likely a fatal error, I don't think
I'd object to just letting the verifier fail and fixing the problem via
repair (or filtering the verifier failure to the case where failure was
otherwise imminent; the historical situation is a little unclear to me
tbh).
