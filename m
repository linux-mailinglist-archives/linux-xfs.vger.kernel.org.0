I had a system spinning yesterday to create this worst case condition
across a couple max sized extents. Testing out the preallocation path, I
see a hit from ~5ms to ~35ms between the baseline variant and the
updated calculation algorithm. Note that the baseline here is only doing
a 16 block prealloc vs. 8gb with the fix, but regardless a 30ms
difference for an 8gb allocation doesn't really seem noticeable enough
to matter. IOW, I think we can disgregard this particular concern...

Thinking about this one a little more.. it seems it's probably not worth
conditionally changing post-eof conversion behavior. Since there are
cases where we probably want post-eof prealloc to remain as unwritten if
it's carried within i_size, that would either be extra code for post-eof
blocks or would split up any kind of heuristic for manually zeroing such
blocks. ISTM that the right approach might be to convert all delalloc ->
unwritten (as this series already does), then perhaps consider a write
time heuristic that would perform manual zeroing of extents if certain
conditions are met (e.g., for unwritten extents under a certain size).

The remaining question to me is whether we should include something like
that before changing delalloc behavior or consider it separately as an
optimization...

Brian

P.S., BTW I forgot to mention on my last pass of this series that it
probably makes sense to reorder these behavioral fixup patches to
precede the patch that actually changes delalloc to allocate unwritten
extents.
