Yeah, using touch/rm becomes fork/exec bound very quickly. You'll
find that using "echo > <file>" is much faster than "touch <file>"
because it runs a shell built-in operation without fork/exec
overhead to create the file. But you can't play tricks like that to
replace rm:

$ time for ((i=0;i<1000;i++)); do touch /mnt/scratch/foo; rm /mnt/scratch/foo ; done

real    0m2.653s
user    0m0.910s
sys     0m2.051s
$ time for ((i=0;i<1000;i++)); do echo > /mnt/scratch/foo; rm /mnt/scratch/foo ; done

real    0m1.260s
user    0m0.452s
sys     0m0.913s
$ time ./open-unlink 1000 /mnt/scratch/foo

real    0m0.037s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.030s
$

Note the difference in system time between the three operations -
almost all the difference in system CPU time is the overhead of
fork/exec to run the touch/rm binaries, not do the filesystem
operations....

Yup, an occasional unlink sitting around for a while on an unlinked
list isn't going to cause a performance problem.  Indeed, such
workloads are more likely to benefit from the reduced unlink()
syscall overhead and won't even notice the increase in background
CPU overhead for inactivation of those occasional inodes.

Yup, sustained bulk throughput is where cache residency really
matters. And for unlink, sustained unlink workloads are quite
common; they often are something people wait for on the command line
or make up a performance critical component of a highly concurrent
workload so it's pretty important to get this part right.

The same conconrrent fsmark create/traverse/unlink workloads I've
been running for the past decade+ demonstrates it pretty simply. I
also saw regressions with dbench (both op latency and throughput) as
the clinet count (concurrency) increased, and with compilebench.  I
didn't look much further because all the common benchmarks I ran
showed perf degradations with arbitrary delays that went away with
the current code we have.  ISTR that parts of aim7/reaim scalability
workloads that the intel zero-day infrastructure runs are quite
sensitive to background inactivation delays as well because that's a
CPU bound workload and hence any reduction in cache residency
results in a reduction of the number of concurrent jobs that can be
run.

Cheers,

Dave.
