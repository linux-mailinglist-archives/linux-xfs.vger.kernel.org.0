Perhaps. I believe Dave mentioned earlier how log size might affect
things.

I created a 125GB lvm volume and see slight deltas in iops going from
testing directly on the block device, to a fully allocated file on
XFS/ext4 and then to a preallocated file on XFS/ext4. In both cases the
numbers are comparable between XFS and ext4. On XFS, I can reproduce a
serious drop in iops if I reduce the default ~64MB log down to 8MB.
Perhaps you could try increasing your log ('-lsize=...' at mkfs time)
and see if that changes anything?

Beyond that, I'd probably try to normalize and simplify your storage
stack if you wanted to narrow it down further. E.g., clean format the
same bdev for XFS and ext4 and pull out things like LUKS just to rule
out any poor interactions.
