FWIW, I (rather infrequently) see things like this in the 10 months or
so that this has been in mainline:

run fstests generic/650 at 2023-05-10 19:17:09
XFS (sda3): EXPERIMENTAL Large extent counts feature in use. Use at your own risk!
XFS (sda3): Mounting V5 Filesystem 75c42b12-8a39-4ecd-aac4-6b6ab0e384bd
XFS (sda3): Ending clean mount
smpboot: CPU 1 is now offline

smpboot: CPU 1 is now offline
smpboot: CPU 3 is now offline

XFS (sda3): ctx ticket reservation ran out. Need to up reservation
XFS (sda3): ticket reservation summary:
XFS (sda3):   unit res    = 9268 bytes
XFS (sda3):   current res = -40 bytes
XFS (sda3):   original count  = 1
XFS (sda3):   remaining count = 1
XFS (sda3): Filesystem has been shut down due to log error (0x2).
XFS (sda3): Please unmount the filesystem and rectify the problem(s).

Not sure what that's about, but given the recent discussions about
percpu counters not quite working correctly when racing with cpu
hotremove, I figured this would be a good time to capture one of the
failures and report it to the list.
