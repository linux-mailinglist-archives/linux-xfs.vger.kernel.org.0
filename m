*shrug* I think "haha depending on the order and the state we may or may
not let you reflink files with the dax flag set on disk so good luck" is
pretty confusing, and I figured this made things more obvious.

I thought that should be an absolute, hch thought it should be ignored
for dax=never, and now ... ?

I think the the current behavior is a bad user experience violating=
principle of least surprise, but I guess we don't have agreement on that.
