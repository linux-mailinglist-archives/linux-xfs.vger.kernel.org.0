Yeah, that's kinda how I felt too.  Maybe later we could come back and 
reconsider it depending on how the refactoring goes.  I've done a little 
research online around about state machine designs, and usually what I 
see is some sort of mapping of state codes to function pointers.  So if 
it's possible to modularize everything into helpers, then an extra layer 
of abstraction starts to make a lot more sense.  But what we wouldn't 
want is so much refactoring that we have a bunch of little helpers so 
small and fragmented that the code flow is a headache to follow.  So I 
figure maybe for now we could just stick to refactoring snippets under 
the switch approach, and if it starts to look like something that could 
really benefit from a fully formed state machine model, we can consider 
it then :-)
