Yeah, I get that.  Fifteen years ago, Barry Naujok and Christoph merged
this weird ascii-ci feature for XFS that purportedly does ... something.
It clearly only works properly if you force userspace to use latin1,
which is totally nuts in 2023 given that the distros default to UTF8
and likely don't test anything else.  It probably wasn't even a good
idea in *2008*, but it went in anyway.  Nobody tested this feature,
metadump breaks with this feature enabled, but as maintainer I get to
maintain these poorly designed half baked projects.

I wouldn't ever enable this feature on any computer I use, and I think
the unicode case-insensitive stuff that's been put in to ext4 and f2fs
lately are not a tarpit that I ever want to visit in XFS.  Directory
names should be sequences of bytes that don't include nulls or slashes,
end of story.

Frankly, I'd rather just drop the entire ascii-ci feature from XFS.  I
doubt anyone's really using it given that xfs_repair will corrupt the
filesystem.  This patch encodes the isupper/tolower code from the
kernel's lib/ctype.c into libxfs so that repair will stop corrupting
these filesystems, nothing more.

We're not introducing any new functionality, just making stupid code
less broken.  I wasn't around let alone maintainer when this feature was
committed, and I wouldn't let it in now.  I am, however, the stuckee who
has to clean up all this shit in the least impactful way I can devise.

Can we instead simply drop ascii-ci support from Linux 6.3i and abruptly
break all those filesystems?  Even though we're past -rc5 now?  That
would make all of this baloney go away, at a cost of breaking userspace.

Agreed!

What then is the point of having tolower in the kernel at all?
