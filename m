Ok, I think that's why you are getting rounding assert failures in
the log code - this code replaces the fixed 4 byte allocation
roundup that is done for the inode fork data buffers, and if you
remove both the round-up I added to xlog_finish_iovec() and the
inode fork roundup, you get unaligned regions and assert failures in
xlog_write()....

The posted patchset was based on top of the xlog-write-rewrite
patchset I posted before this one, so I'd say that's where the
conflicts applying this to a base 5.18-rc2 kernel came from.

Cheers,

Dave.
