The intent behind this new classification is for things that we can't
ever fix or rebuild in the filesystem.  However, at least for now, file
data loss is the only source of unfixable errors.

If there's even the slightest hint of things still being wrong with the
filesystem or the underlying storage, we should avoid writing to the
storage (e.g. FITRIM) because that could screw things up even more.

Note that this fstrim happens at the end of phase 4, so that means that
if we have any corruptions or unfixable errors at this point, they're in
the metadata, our attempts to fix them have failed, and so we absolutely
should not go writing more things to the disk.

It won't, because the media scan happens during phase 6.

They will, presumably.  For an unfixable error to stop the connectivity
checks (phase 5), the unfixable error would have to be observed during
phases 1-4.  Those first four phases exclusively look for (and repair)
internal fs metadata, so if we reach phase 5 with an unfixable error
that means the fs metadata are trashed and xfs_scrub is going to fail
anyway.

Note that I haven't actually tried to write a directory repair function
yet.  The last time I asked viro about it he wondered what in the hell I
was going to do about the dentry cache and doubted that it could be
done... so either I have to prove him wrong, or maybe directories /will/
become the first source of unfixable errors for phase 1-4.

So yes, the 'unfixable' category is supposed to be broad enough to cover
more than just file data loss, though for now it's only used for that.
