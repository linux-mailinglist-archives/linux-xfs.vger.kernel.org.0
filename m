Ok, fixed.

I decided to tweak the paragraph a little:

		/*
		 * If the flush fails, we cannot conclude that past metadata
		 * writeback from the log succeeded.  Repeating the flush is
		 * not possible, hence we must shut down with log IO error to
		 * avoid shutdown re-entering this path and erroring out
