Is anyone productizing on that though?

I was curious since most distros are disabling CONFIG_XFS_RT so I was
curious who was actually testing this stuff or caring about it.

For those that *are* using XFS in production with realtime volume with dax...
I wonder whatcha doing about all these tests on fstests which we don't
have a proper way to know if the test succeeded / failed [0] when an
external logdev is used, this then applies to regular external log dev
users as well [1].

Which makes me also wonder then, what are the typical big users of the
regular external log device?

Reviewing a way to address this on fstests has been on my TODO for
a while, but it begs the question of how much do we really care first.
And that's what I was really trying to figure out.

Can / should we phase out external logdev / realtime dev? Who really is
caring about this code these days?
