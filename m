Umm ... yes ...

I think I've got the active code path right ...

At this point .mount == xfs_fs_mount() which will calls
xfs_fs_fill_super() to fill the super block.

xfs_fs_fill_super() allocates the super block info struct and sets
it in the super block private info field, then calls xfs_parseargs()
which still allocates mp->m_fsname at this point, to accomodate a
similar free pattern in xfs_test_remount_options().

It then calls __xfs_fs_fill_super() which doesn't touch those fsname
fields or mp to fit in with what will be done later.

If an error occurs both the fsname fields (xfs_free_fsname()) and mp
are freed by the main caller, xfs_fs_fill_super().

I think that process is ok.

The mount api process that isn't active yet is a bit different.

The context (ctx), a temporary working space, is allocated then saved
in the mount context (fc) and the super block info is also allocated
and saved in the mount context in it's field of the same name as the
private super block info field, s_fs_info.

The function xfs_fill_super() is called as a result of the .get_tree()
mount context operation to fill the super block.

During this process, when the VFS successfully allocates the super
block s_fs_info is set in the super block and the mount context
field set to NULL. From this point freeing the private super block
info becomes part of usual freeing of the super block with the super
operation .kill_sb().

But if the super block allocation fails then the mount context
s_fs_info field remains set and is the responsibility of the
mount context operations .fc_free() method to clean up.

Now the VFS calls to xfs_fill_super() after this.

I should have been able to leave xfs_fill_super() it as it
was with:
        sb->s_fs_info = NULL;
        xfs_free_fsname(mp);
        kfree(mp);
and that should have been ok but it wasn't, there was some sort of
allocation problem, possibly a double free, causing a crash.

Strictly speaking this cleanup process should be carried out by
either the mount context .fc_free() or super operation .kill_sb()
and that's what I want to do.

So I'm not sure the allocation time and the place this is done
can (or should) be done differently.

And that freeing on error exit from xfs_fill_super() is definitely
wrong now! Ha, and I didn't see any crashes myself when I tested
it ... maybe I need a reproducer ...
