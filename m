Yeah, they are on the way.
By the way, the second patch to fix the droplink deadlock will be 
a separate patch that not contains this iunlink_remove() deadlock
patch because they have different use and different reasons, so 
I'm worry about that this patch will be forget after that, so
send a ping...
For the reproducers, the original testcase will cost about ten
minutes to reproduce the problem, so I am trying to reduce this
time and send it when done.
