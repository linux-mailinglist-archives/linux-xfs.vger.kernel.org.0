I don't really think that is true.  But if you feel you need more time
please clearly ask for it.  I've done that in the past and most of the
time the relevant people acted on it (not always).

So you speak for other people here?

I'm not sure who "you" is, but please say what is going wrong and what
you'd like to do better.

What Darrick wrote feels a little snarky, but he has a very valid
point.  A lot of recent bug fixes come from better test coverage, where
better test coverage is mostly two new fuzzers hitting things, or
people using existing code for different things that weren't tested
much before.  And Darrick is single handedly responsible for a large
part of the better test coverage, both due to fuzzing and specific
xfstests.  As someone who's done a fair amount of new development
recently I'm extremely glad about all this extra coverage.
