I think that this can be greatly simplified. We simply us
REQ_PREFLUSH | REQ_FUA on all commit records that close off a
transaction. The pre-flush can be used to guarantee that all the
preceeding log writes have completed to the journal, then the commit
record is written w/ FUA, guaranteeing the entire checkpoint is on
stable storage before we run the checkpoint completion callbacks
that unpin the dirty items and insert them into the AIL. This means
we don't need to modify the AIL at all, and all the metadata vs
journal ordering is still maintained entirely within the journal.

The only additional complexity is that we have to separate the
commit record into a new iclog from the rest of the checkpoint,
unless the checkpoint fits entirely inside a single iclog. I don't
think this is hard to do - we can probably do it once we've written
the commit record and hold a reference to the iclog the commit
record was written to that prevents it from being flushed until
we release the reference to it.

This won't a concern with the above change, because the commit
mechanism provides the same guarantees about stable journal contents
as it does now...

Cheers,

Dave.
