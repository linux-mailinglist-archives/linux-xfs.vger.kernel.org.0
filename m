Hmmm.... in particular, this fix:

2254a7396a0c xfs: fix xfs_inodegc_stop racing with mod_delayed_work
  Fixes: 6191cf3ad59f ("xfs: flush inodegc workqueue tasks before cancel")

mentions:

----
For this to trip, we must have a thread draining the inodedgc workqueue
and a second thread trying to queue inodegc work to that workqueue.
This can happen if freezing or a ro remount race with reclaim poking our
faux inodegc shrinker and another thread dropping an unlinked O_RDONLY
file:
----

I'm indeed periodically freezing these filesystems to take snapshots.

So that could possibly be the source of my problem, although my kernel log 
does not have the WARN_ON_ONCE() mentioned in the patch.

Cheers,

Chris
