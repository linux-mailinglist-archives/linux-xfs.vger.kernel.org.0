I'm just not seeing what the problem here is. The behaviour you are
describing has been around since day zero and doesn't require the
addition of an ail push from iclog completion to trigger.  Prior to
this series, it would be:

process 1	reservation	log completion	xfsaild
<completes metadata IO>
  xfs_ail_delete()
    mlip_changed
    xlog_assign_tail_lsn_locked()
      ail empty, sets l_last_sync = 0x1000032e2
    xfs_log_space_wake()
				xlog_state_do_callback
				  sets CALLBACK
				  sets last_sync_lsn to iclog head
				    -> 0x1000032e4
				  <drops icloglock, gets preempted>
		<wakes>
		xlog_grant_head_wait
		  free_bytes < need_bytes
		    xlog_grant_push_ail()
		      xlog_push_ail()
		        ->ail_target 0x1000032e4
		<sleeps>
						<wakes>
						sets prev target to 0x1000032e4
						sees empty AIL
						<sleeps>
				    <runs again>
				    runs callbacks
				      xfs_ail_insert(lsn = 0x1000032e4)

and now we have the AIL push thread asleep with items in it at the
push threshold.  IOWs, what you describe has always been possible,
and before the CIL was introduced this sort of thing happened quite
a bit because iclog completions freed up much less space in the log
than a CIL commit completion.

It's not a problem, however, because if we are out of transaction
reservation space we must have transactions in progress, and as long
as they make progress then the commit of each transaction will end
up calling xlog_ungrant_log_space() to return the unused portion of
the transaction reservation. That calls xfs_log_space_wake() to
allow reservation waiters to try to make progress.

If there's still not enough space reservation after the transaction
in progress has released it's reservation, then it goes back to
sleep. As long as we have active transactions in progress while
there are transaction reservations waiting on reservation space,
there will be a wakeup vector for the reservation independent of
the CIL, iclogs and AIL behaviour.

[ Yes, there was a bug here, in the case xfs_log_space_wake() did
not issue a wakeup because of not enough space being availble and
the push target was limited by the old log head location. i.e.
nothing ever updated the push target to reflect the new log head and
so the tail might never get moved now. That particular bug was fixed
by a an earlier patch in the series, so we can ignore it here. ]

IOWs, if the AIL is empty, the CIL cannot consume more than 25% of
the log space, and we have transactions waiting on log reservation
space, then we must have enough transactions in progress to cover at
least 75% of the log space. Completion of those transactions will
wake waiters and, if necessary, push the AIL again to keep the log
tail moving appropriately. This handles the AIL empty and "insert
before target" situations you are concerned about just fine, as long
as we have a guarantee of forwards progress. Bounding the CIL size
provides that forwards progress guarantee for the CIL...

Cheers,

Dave.
