I think the more appropriate thing to do is open code the data write and
wait and use the variants of the latter that don't consume address space
errors in the first place (i.e. filemap_fdatawait_keep_errors()). Then
we wouldn't need the special error handling branch or perhaps the first
part of the comment. Hm?
