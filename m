I think this was a lot more necessary under the old design because I let
the number of tagged inodes grow quite large before triggering gc work,
much less throttling anything.  256 is low enough that it should be
manageable.

Does it matter that we no longer inactivate inodes in inode number
order?  I guess it could be nice to be able to dump inode cluster
buffers as soon as practicable, but OTOH I suspect that only matters for
the case of mass deletion, in which case we'll probably catch up soon
enough?

Anyway, I'll try turning both of these off with my silly deltree
exerciser and see what happens.

Yep.  I came to the same conclusion last night; it looks like my fast
fstests setup for that passed.

Yeah... I actually tried running fstests on a 512M VM and whooeee did I
see a lot of OOM kills.  Clearly we've all gotten spoiled by cheap DRAM.

Ok, I'll jam those on the front end of the series.

It's probably about time for that.  Now that we do percpu thingies, I
think it might also be time for a test that runs fstests while plugging
and unplugging the non-bsp processors.
