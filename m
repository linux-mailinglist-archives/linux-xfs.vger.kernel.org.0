I was actually just hoping that someone could confirm that the functionality, as visible from userspace, should be identical, apart from timing. Or, that someone might have an idea based on experience what could be causing the different behavior. This was not intended as a bug report for XFS.

But I'm grateful, of course, if you want to look deeper into it.

Through further investigation, I've pinpointed the discrepancy between functional and non-functional filesystems, narrowing it down from "V5 vs. V4" to "ftype=1 vs. ftype=0"

Detailed filesystem configurations and a comparison are available at https://owww.molgen.mpg.de/~buczek/zt/

Included are:

    test.sh: The main script setting up two XFS volumes and initiating the build process using build.sh.
    test.log: The output log from test.sh.
    build.log: Located in xfs_{ok,fail} directories, containing the build process outputs.
    cmp.sh and cmp.log: A script and its output for comparing xfs_ok and xfs_fail directories.

In build.sh there is a test which demonstrated the build failure: "stage3/lib" not produced.  After that test, the command which should produce stage3/lib is run again, this time with strace. The traces are in xfs_{ok,fail}/traces and the whole build directories in xfs_{ok,fail}/zig-0.11.0

There is also a script cmp.sh and its output cmp.log, which compares the xfs_ok and xfs_fail directories. It also produces traces.cmp.txt which is a (width 200) side by side comparison of the strace files.

The outcome has been be replicated across various CPU architectures and kernel versions.

Best regards,

  Donald
