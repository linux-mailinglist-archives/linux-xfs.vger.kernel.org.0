Rule #1: don't introduce new bugs into stable kernels.

This commit has a known (and fixed) bug in it. If you are going to
back port it to a stable kernel, then you need to also pull in the
fix for that commit, too.

But the bigger question is this: why propose backports of commits
that only change debug code?

ASSERT()s are not compiled into production kernels - they are only
compiled into developer builds when CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG=y is set. It is
test code, not production code, hence nobody will be using this in
production kernels.

I don't see the value in backporting debug fixes unless there
is some other dependency that requires them. But if you are going to
back port them, Rule #1 applies.

Cheers,

Dave.
