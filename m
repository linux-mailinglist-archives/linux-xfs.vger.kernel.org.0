Heh. "Dave lore".

Better reference - glibc Irix v4 compatibility header file from
1997:

https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/glibc-ports/+/master/sysdeps/unix/sysv/irix4/bits/fcntl.h

What it tells us is that fcntl(F_ALLOCSP) was supported on Irix 4.0
and the release dates for Irix 4 were 09/91 to 04/93. So there's the
"for EFS in the early 1990s" date in a more concrete form...

XFS was first released 18 months later in Irix 5.3 in December
1994....

I wouldn't even say "dangerous", just that they are no longer
supported. I would dump the process name, too, so we can identify
what application (if any) is still using this, and maybe even append
"Use fallocate(2) instead."

Otherwise looks good.

Cheers,

Dave.
