I think it's on the package maintainer to ensure what is uploaded as
the official distro package contains the correct tarball contents
for their distro. If the distro build overrides shipped config
files, then there shouldn't be any problems at all with just using
the upstream tarball.

Honestly, I think building packages from tarballs is an anachronism
of a time gone by. Debian xfsprogs packages can be build directly
from a clean git tree and none of these problems exist in that case.
i.e. a clean git tree requires the build to libtoolize/autoconf and
set up the source tree from it's environment before anything else,
hence there's nothing that needs to be overridden...

Cheers,

Dave.
