The hardware has 128 cpu cores, and the xfs filesystem format config is default,
while the test is a single thread, as follow:
./mdtest -I 10  -z 6 -b 8 -d /mnt/ -t -c 2

Got it,

Yeah, we just run one thread test.

Agree, we add some debug info in xfs_mod_ifree and found most times
m_ifree.count < batch * num_online_cpus(),  because we have 128 online
cpus and m_ifree.count around 999.

percpu_counter_read that reads the count will cause cache synchronization
cost if other cpu changes the count, Maybe it's better not to call
percpu_counter_compare if possible.
