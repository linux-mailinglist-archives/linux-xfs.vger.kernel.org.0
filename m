Yes, I know, which is why the moment I saw xfs/336 I called it out -
it has never run on my machines, ever...

Not a great fan of it myself. But it's no worse than other scripting
languages that use JIT based syntax checking from the "if it wasn't
run it ain't tested" perspective.

fstests configurations for block based filesystems have always been
based on block devices and mount points, not image files. 

Yes, you can pass an image file to XFS utilities and they will do
the right thing, but not all filesystems or all the infrastructure
in fstests can handle an image file masquerading as a device.

I certainly didn't expect it.....

fstests is woefully under-documented - especially when it comes to
configuration constraints and behaviours - so I doubt it is actually
specified anywhere. AFAIA it has never been raised in discussion
for a long time (not since we added network filesystem support a
long time ago, IIRC)

However, the code is pretty explicit - common/config is responsible
for setting up and validating the runtime config before any test can
run. All test and scratch devices are passed through this
validation:

_check_device()
{
        local name=$1
        local dev_needed=$2
        local dev=$3

        if [ -z "$dev" ]; then
                if [ "$dev_needed" == "required" ]; then
                        _fatal "common/config: $name is required but not defined!"
                fi
                return 0
        fi

        if [ -b "$dev" ] || ( echo $dev | grep -qE ":|//" ); then
                # block device or a network url
                return 0
	fi

	case "$FSTYP" in
        9p|fuse|tmpfs|virtiofs|afs)
	.....
	*)
                _fatal "common/config: $name ($dev) is not a block device or a network filesystem"
        esac
}
....

Basically, it says that all the test and scratch devices (including
the external ones) must be either a block device, a network URL, or
a string that the specific filesystem under test must recognise and
accept (e.g. a directory for overlay filesystems). Otherwise fstests
will fail to run with an explicit error message that says:

	<device> is not a block device or network filesystem

Nowhere in this config validation process does fstests consider
image files as a valid device configuration for a block based
filesystem.

If we need to do stuff with a image files, we have the
infrastructure to create loop devices and then operate directly on
that dynamic loop device(s) (e.g. _mkfs_dev, _mount, _unmount,
_check_xfs_filesystem, etc) that are created.

That's because it's validated before we start running tests and the
assumption is that nobody is screwing with SCRATCH_DEV in a way
that makes it behave vastly differently.

Consider what it means to have to do runtime checking of the
device validity in common code before we do anything with the
device. We'd have to sprinkle _check_device calls -everywhere-.

We'd also have to check logdev and rtdev variables if USE_EXTERNAL
is set, too.

That's not a viable development strategy, nor is it a maintainable
solution to the issue at hand. It's far simpler to fix one test not
to use this trick than it is to declare "nobody can trust TEST_DEV
or SCRATCH_DEV to be a valid block device" and have to handle that
everywhere those variables are used...

True.

But in the case of fstests we explicitly create loop
devices so that we don't have to play whacky games to find the
random loop device that mount magically creates when you pass it a
file.

Making all the image file and loop device usage consistent across
all of fstests was part of the infrastructure changes in my initial
check-parallel patchset. This was necessary because killing tests
with ctrl-c would randomly leave dangling mounts and loop devices
because many tests did not have _cleanup routines to tear down
mounts that auto-created loop devices or clean up loop
devices they created themselves properly.

Part of those changes was fixing up the mess in some XFS tests
where that mixed loop device and image file based operations
interchangably. I didn't notice x/336 because it wasn't
running on my test system and so didn't attempt to fix it at the
same time...
