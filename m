(Re)trying to clear more space sounds like a good idea.

At least for the link case, you can trivially continue to expand the
directory by hardlinking the same file over and over.  Part of the
weirdness here might be related to the fact that a transaction with no
quota reservation is allowed to commit the quota usage changes, even if
that would bump them past the limit.

Hm.  Perhaps the trick here should be that we reduce resblks to zero for
ENOSPC or EDQUOT, which means that you can continue link()ing files
into a directory so long as it won't cause the dir to expand.
xfs_remove (aka unlink()) handles reservationless removals by deferring
the directory shrink operation if there isn't space, so I think it can
be ported to use the new "alloc and reserve" function too.

Yeah, there are more fiddly fixes for setattr coming down the line
too...
