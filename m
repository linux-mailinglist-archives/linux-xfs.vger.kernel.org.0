Nope, it does not do that.

This means every child deferop takes a full tp->t_log_count
reservation, whilst in memory the child reservation would ahve been
handled by the parent via the log ticket unit count being
decremented by one. Hence child deferops -never- run with the same
maximal reservation that their parents held.

The difference is that at runtime we are rolling transaction which
regrant space from the initial reservation of (tp->t_log_count *
tp->t_log_res) made a run time. i.e. the first child deferop that
runs has a total log space grant of ((tp->t_log_count - 1)
* tp->t_log_res), the second it is "- 2", and so on right down to
when the log ticket runs out of initial reservation and so it goes
to reserving a single unit (tp->t_log_res) at a time.

Hence both the intents being recovered and all their children are
over-reserving log space by using the default log count for the
&M_RES(mp)->tr_itruncate reservation. Even if we ignore the initial
reservation being incorrect, the child reservations of the same size
as the parent are definitely incorrect. They really should be
allowed only a single unit reservation, and if the transaction rolls
to process defer ops, it needs to regrant new log space during the
commit process.

Hence I think this can only be correct as:

	dfc->dfc_tres.tr_log_count = 1;

Regardless of how many units the parent recovery reservation
obtained. (Which I also think can only be correct as 1 because we
don't know how many units of reservation space the parent had
consumed when it was logged.)

Cheers,

Dave.
