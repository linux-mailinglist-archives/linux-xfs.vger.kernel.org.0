Hi Dave, thank you for your explanation. The observed behavior of a 
large LSU surely matches what you described - less-than-optimal fsync perf.

That said, I was wondering why *logbsize* (rather than LSU) has a low 
default of 32k (or, better, its default is to match LSU size). If I 
understand it correctly, a large logbsize (eg: 256k) on top of a small 
LSU (32k) would give high performance on both full-log-writes and 
partial-log-writes (eg: frequent fsync).

Is my understanding correct? If you, do you suggest to always set 
logbsize to the maximum supported value?

Thanks.
