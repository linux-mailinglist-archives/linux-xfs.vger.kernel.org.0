To clarify, we certainly _do_ care what you think. It's just that
when faced with the difficulties of the compiler's implementations of
handling this, the kernel had to get creative and pick the least-bad of
many bad choices. We're trying to make the kernel safer for everyone,
and this particular C language weakness has caused us a significant
number of bugs. Eradicating it is worth the effort.

All that said, as you pointed out, you _have_ asked before[1] to just
have Linus take it without bothering you directly, so okay, that can be
done. Generally maintainers have wanted these changes to go through their
trees so it doesn't cause them merge pain, but it seems you'd prefer it
the other way around.
