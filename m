How do we know it's going to be multi-bio before we actually start
packing the data into the bios? More below, because I kinda pointed
out how this might be solved...

We can't assume anything about the callers in the lower layers.
Anything that can call the VFS read/write paths could be using async
IO.

Please have a look at how IOCB_HIPRI is handled by iomap for
multi-bio IOs. I -think- the same can be done with IOMAP_NOWAIT
bios, because the bio IO completion for the EAGAIN error will be
present on the iomap_dio by the time submit_bio returns. i.e.
REQ_NOWAIT can be set on the first bio in the submission chain,
but only on the first bio.

i.e. if REQ_NOWAIT causes the first bio submission to fail with
-EAGAIN being reported to completion, we abort the submission or
more bios because dio->error is now set. As there are no actual bios
in flight at this point in time, the only reference to the iomap_dio
is held by the iomap submission code.  Hence as we finalise the
aborted DIO submission, __iomap_dio_rw() drops the last reference
and iomap_dio_rw() calls iomap_dio_complete() on the iomap_dio. This
then gathers the -EAGAIN error that was stashed in the iomap_dio
and returns it to the caller.

i.e. I *think* this "REQ_NOWAIT only for the first bio" method will
solve most of the issues that cause submission latency (especially
for apps doing small IOs), but still behave correctly when large,
multi-bio DIOs are submitted.

Confirming that the logic is sound and writing fstests that exercise
the functionality to demonstrate your eventual kernel change works
correctly (and that we don't break it in future) is your problem,
though.

Tough cookies. Random load related IO errors that can result in
unexpected user data corruption is a far worse outcome than an
application suffering from a bit of unexpected latency. You are not
going to win that argument, so don't bother wasting time on it.

Don't be so melodramatic. Async IO has always been, and will always
be, -best effort- within the constraints of filesystem
implementation, data integrity and behavioural correctness.
