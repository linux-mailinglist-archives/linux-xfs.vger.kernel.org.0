If 1k block size is not a "must have", we could leave that part to
MKFS_OPTIONS and don't specify block size in the test, i.e. testing with
different MKFS_OPTIONS could cover various block sizes, e.g.

MKFS_OPTIONS="-bsize=1k,-m crc=1,reflink=1" ./check ...

Yeah, it's good to figure out a small file count (no need to be
smallest) that could reproduce the deadlock reliably.
