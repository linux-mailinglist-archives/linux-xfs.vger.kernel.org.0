It's 2GB out of terabytes so I don't really care about the space but the 
"other issues" is a problem.

The space being leaked is fine but xfs_repair is an issue. I did some 
testing and yes, if I run xfs_repair on one of these filesystems with a 
moved log it causes all sorts of problems. In fact it doesn't seem to 
work at all. Big problem.

Yes, I understand. I was thinking more of an offline utility for doing 
this but I see why that can't be done in growfs.

So I guess it doesn't really work. This is why I ask the experts. I'll 
keep experimenting because due to the requirements of needing to 
physically move disks around, being able to move the log back and forth 
from internal to external would be extremely helpful.

Thanks!
