Oh, I see what you mean.  No, I had done a review of the uses of 
xfs_attr_rmtval_remove and realized that it appears in both the set and 
remove paths. We use it in the set path when we're doing a rename, and 
need to remove the old attr.

So in patch 13, we replace xfs_attr_rmtval_remove with 
xfs_attr_rmtval_unmap for the remove routines.  But it's still in the 
set routines.  So we cant take it away yet.  Once we get through patch 
14, it is no longer used and we can remove it.  Did that make sense?

Alrighty, I was thinking that if I reordered things such that 
modularizing appeared at the end of the set, that it would help people 
to see it in context with the states.  But it sounds like people like it 
the other way around, it's easy enough to put back.  Though I think we 
may still be stuck with 12 and 19 being apart unless 13 and 14 come 
together.  :-(
