Agreed; it's past time to shift the world towards the idea that one
grabs the incore object and only then starts grabbing buffers.  But even
if you've done it correctly:

	pag = xfs_perag_get_active(agno);
	xfs_alloc_read_agf(tp, ..., &agfbp);

Why not pass in just the buffer?

	cur = xfs_rmapbt_init_cursor(tp, agfbp, pag);

Is the idea here simply that we don't want to give people the idea that
they can just read the agf and pass it to xfs_rmapbt_init_cursor?  In
other words, the third parameter is there to give the people the
impression that pag and agfbp are both equally important tokens, and
that callers must obtain both and pass them in?  No monkeying around
with the buffer's passive reference by higher level code, at all, ever?
I guess I can live with that.  I might just be micro-optimising function
call parameter counts.  :P
