I was about to point out all the complaints about when I actually /did/
merge Dave's branch, but I realized that those complaints were actually
because he wasn't consistently signing patches with the same email
address.

Um... do you know if there's a commit hook or something that all of us
can add to spot-check all this stuff?  I would really like to spend my
worry beans on about algorithms and code design, not worrying about how
many signature rules can be bent before LT starts refusing pull requests.

Heh.  That ship has sailed, unfortunately.  If we /really/ care about
maintainers adding their own SoB tags to non-merge commits then I /have/
to rebase.
