It's theoretically possible, but I'd bet that making it work reliably
will be difficult for an infrequent operation.  The old log would probably
have to clean itself, and then write a single transaction containing
both the bnobt update to allocate the new log as well as an EFI to erase
it.  Then you write to the new log a single transaction containing the
superblock and an EFI to free the old log.  Then you update the primary
super and force it out to disk, un-quiesce the log, and finish that EFI
so that the old log gets freed.

And then you have to go back and find the necessary parts that I missed.
