No idea. I don't understand the cocci syntax, and I'm not about to
audit 250+ automated changes to see if it does anything different to
a simple sed regex. Nor am I expecting reviewers to manually check
every single one of these conversions - I expect them to understand
what basic unix tools sed and regexes do and be able to extrapolate
from there. :)

And, really, I don't want to have to sink an hour or two into making
some tool I have no idea how to use to do what took me about 10s to
implement and execute. Indeed, I don't even have cocci installed on
any of my machines, so I'd be starting from "how the hell do I even
run this thing"....

Cheers,

Dave.
