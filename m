Ok. Well, I was only talking about moving lines in your patch, nothing functional
at all. And ... that's why I had asked earlier (I think?) if your patch was
considered ready for review/merge, or just a demonstration of things to come.

So I guess changing it to a static inline as you suggest should be done before
merge.  Anything else like that that you don't actually consider quite ready,
in the first 3 patches?

Thanks,
