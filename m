It would have to be a sync transaction plus sync AIL force in
transaction allocation context if we were to log the superblock change,
which sounds a bit hairy...

... until it's cleared again. Granted, that would only occur once the
log idles.

Agreed. That is a notable simplification and I think much more
preferable than the above for the dynamic approach.

That said, note that dynamic feature bits might introduce complexity in
more subtle ways. For example, nothing that I can see currently
serializes idle log covering with an active transaction (that may have
just set an incompat bit via some hook yet not committed anything to the
log subsystem), so it might not be as simple as just adding a hook
somewhere.

Indeed, that is a potential wart with just setting bits on mount. I do
think this is likely to be the case with or without dynamic feature
bits, because at least in certain cases we'll be setting incompat bits
in short order anyways. E.g., one of the primary use cases here is for
xattrs, which is likely to be active on any root filesystem via things
like SELinux, etc. Point being, all it takes is one feature bit
associated with some core operation to introduce this risky update
scenario in practice.

I dunno... I'm just trying to explore whether we can simplify this whole
concept to something more easily managed and less likely to cause us
headache. I'm a bit concerned that we're disregarding other tradeoffs
like the complexity noted above, the risk and cost of bugs in the
mechanism itself (because log recovery has historically been so well
tested.. :P) or whether the idea of new kernels immediately delivering
new incompat log formats is a robust/reliable solution in the first
place. IIRC, the last time we did this was ICREATE and that was hidden
behind the v5 update. IOW, for certain things like the xattr rework, I'd
think that kind of experimental stabilization cycle is warranted before
we'd consider enabling such a feature, even dynamically (which means a
revertible kernel should be available in common/incremental upgrade
cases).

Anyways, it sounds like both you and Darrick still prefer this approach
so this is just my .02 for the time being..
