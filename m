Have we verified that the actual page cache is inconsistent, or is that
just an assumption? I'm asking since I poked a bit on the fio side, and
suspiciously the failed verification was a short IO. At least
originally, fio will retry those, but it could be a bug in the io_uring
engine for fio.

I'll poke some more.
