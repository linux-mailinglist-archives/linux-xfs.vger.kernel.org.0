We can do it crappily in C with __bitwise and letting the static checker
bots go wild.  Some day when someone rewrites the entire codebase in
Rust (HA!) then we'll be able to do:

struct xfs_fsblock_t(u64);
struct xfs_agblock_t(u32);

and (to the extent that I understand Rust) the Rust compiler will
complain about stuffing xfs_agblock_t into an xfs_fsblock_t without a
proper conversion.
