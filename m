Ahah, that's what happened to that patchset.  Well in that case, since
xfs_reclaim_inodes* is going to stick around, I think it makes more
sense to refactor xfs_inodes_walk_ag to handle XFS_ICI_RECLAIM_TAG, and
then xfs_reclaim_inodes_ag can go away entirely.

That said, xfs_reclaim_inodes_ag does have some warts (like updating the
per-ag reclaim cursor and decrementing nr_to_scan) that would add
clutter.
