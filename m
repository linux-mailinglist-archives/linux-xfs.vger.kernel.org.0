Right, that was intentional. It is based on the fact that if we
are recovering a set or a replace operation, we have to remove the
INCOMPLETE xattr first. However, if the attr fork is empty, there's
no INCOMPLETE xattr to remove, and so we can just go straight to the
set operation to create the new value.

Hmmm - what was the failure? Was it a null pointer dereference
on ip->i_afp? I wonder if you hit the corner case where attr removal
can remove the attr fork, and that's when it crashed and we've tried
to recover from?

Oh, I think I might have missed a case there. If you look at
xfs_attr_sf_removename() I added a case to avoid removing the attr
fork when XFS_DA_OP_RENAME is set because we don't want to remove it
when we are about to add to it again. But I didn't add the same
logic to xfs_attr3_leaf_to_shortform() which can also trash the attr
fork if the last attr we remove from the attr fork is larger than
would fit in a sf attr fork. Hence we go straight from leaf form to
no attr fork at all.

Ok, that's definitely a bug, I'll need to fix that, and it could be
the cause of this issue as removing the attr fork will set
forkoff to 0 and so the inode will not have an attr fork
instantiated when it is read into memory...

Yup, that's a good idea.

I'm going to try to move them up into patches 4 and 13, so that
recovery at least tries to function correctly as we move through the
patch set.

Cheers,

Dave.
