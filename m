Perhaps. We can measure how many xfs inodes are cached via the
filesystem stats e.g.

$ pminfo -t xfs.vnodes.active
xfs.vnodes.active [number of vnodes not on free lists]
$ sudo grep xfs_inode /proc/slabinfo | awk '{ print $2 }'
243440
$ pminfo -f xfs.vnodes.active

xfs.vnodes.active
    value 243166
$

And so we should be able to run a bulkstat from fstests on a
filesystem with a known amount of files in it and measure the number
of cached inodes before/after...

I noticed this because I recently re-added the threaded per-ag
bulkstat scan to my scalability workload (via the xfs_io bulkstat
command) after I dropped it ages ago because per-ag threading of
fstests::src/bulkstat.c was really messy. It appears nobody has
been paying attention to bulkstat memory usage (and therefore
I_DONTCACHE behaviour) for some time....

Cheers,

Dave.
