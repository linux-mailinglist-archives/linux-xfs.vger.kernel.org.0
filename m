Agreed. Consumers of the buffer cache API should never look at b_error
because they will not see buffers with b_error set at all.

Yeah.  The brelese seems to go back to:

    Rewrite inactive attribute code to avoid freeing any of the data blocks
    until the very end.  We still walk the on-disk structure, but just
    call xfs_trans_binval on the buffers we get.  Then we call the truncate
    code to get rid of the data blocks.  This means we don't need a block
    reservation.

and the loop іtself is even older.  But the da_state had been around
since 1996, so that isn't really an excuse.

Yeah.  I also don't see how a b_error could even magically appear
here without xfs_trans_get_buf returning an error first.

Yes.
