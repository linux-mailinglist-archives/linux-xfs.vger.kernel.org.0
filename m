They completely went away now that there's only one possible healer
instance per mount and direct function calls.  I'll delete the sentence.

Yeah.  Once that's happened, the strongest argument is that we can
define our own formats without being subject to any of fsnotify's event
size constraints, and (more importantly) not needing to clutter up
fanotify's UABI with xfs-specific structures.  How about:

"Using a pseudofile gives the kernel and xfs_healer the flexibility to
expose xfs-specific filesystem details without cluttering up fanotify's
userspace ABI.
Normal userspace programs are not expected to subscribe to these events."

That's an interesting philosophical question that Allison brought up
during review of this same document years ago.  I chose to leave these
Q&A's about the road not travelled in the doc because people keep
bringing then up, and I think it's useful to present that.

I left them as a separate Q&A sidebar to make it a little more obvious
that it's a sidebar.

I'm not sure.  brauner said he merged it, but I haven't seen it show up
in vfs.all or anywhere else in vfs.git.  I asked him about the status
yesterday:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/176602332085.686273.7564676516217176769.stgit@frogsfrogsfrogs/T/#mb00d485a7a146529c1bb022217d56ead50811162

but have not yet received a reply.

Oh yes very much not true anymore.

"When a filesystem is mounted, the kernel initiates a fsnotify event
describing the mount point and path to the data device.
A separate systemd service will listen for these mount events via
fanotify, and can start a mount-specific xfs_healer service instance."
