From: Darrick J. Wong <darrick.wong@oracle.com>

A customer reported rcu stalls and softlockup warnings on a computer
with many CPU cores and many many more IO threads trying to write to a
filesystem that is totally out of space.  Subsequent analysis pointed to
the many many IO threads calling xfs_flush_inodes -> sync_inodes_sb,
which causes a lot of wb_writeback_work to be queued.  The writeback
worker spends so much time trying to wake the many many threads waiting
for writeback completion that it trips the softlockup detector, and (in
this case) the system automatically reboots.

In addition, they complain that the lengthy xfs_flush_inodes scan traps
all of those threads in uninterruptible sleep, which hampers their
ability to kill the program or do anything else to escape the situation.

Fix this by replacing the full filesystem flush (which is offloaded to a
workqueue which we then have to wait for) with directly flushing the
file that we're trying to write.
