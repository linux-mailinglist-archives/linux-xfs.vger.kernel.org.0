I originally wrote this thinking about using the ic_write_wait queue
which would require checking all iclogs in the ring because the
completion signalled at the DONE_SYNC state is not ordered against
other iclogs. Hence I had planned to walk all the iclogs. THen I
realised that checking the LSN could tell us past/future and so we
only needed to wait on the first iclog with a LSN less than the
commit iclog.

ANd so I left the loop in place to ensure that, even if my assertion
about the ring aging order was incorrect, this code would Do The
Right Thing.

Yes, that is what it does.

I can strip this all out - it was really just being defensive
because I wanted to make sure things were working as I expected them
to be working...

Cheers,

Dave.
