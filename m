Yep, that's a typo, can you send a patch to fix the xfs_format.h
comments, please?

The incore timer field is the usual 64-bit time_t, like you'd expect.
However, its usage is clamped such that we only use the lower 34 bits of
the field, because the ondisk timer field is still 32 bits wide.  At the
time of review for bigtime, we decided that losing the lower 2 bits of
precision was a better sacrifice than redesigning the ondisk dquot
format.  This results in a resolution of 4 seconds (instead of 1)
because the conversion is:

ondisk_timer = incore_timer >> 2;

Hence the ondisk field encodes the upper 32 bits of a (logically) 34-bit
counter.
