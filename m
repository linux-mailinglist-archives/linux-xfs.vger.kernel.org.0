Aggressive? Not at all. I'm being realistic.

We've still got bugs in the for-next tree that need to be fixed and
this code is part of the problem. It's already -rc7 and we need to
focus on understanding the bugs in for-next well enough to either
fix them or revert them.

Cosmetic concerns about the code are extremely low priority right
now, so can you please just have a little patience here and wait for
me to deal with the bugs rather than bikeshedding log messages that
might not even exist in a couple of days time?

-Dave.
