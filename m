That sounds like a mount(1) bug, not a kernel bug. Something is
adding the "noattr2" option to the remount line. Running you test
on my system doesn't show that warning. I'm running a 5.11-rc5 kernel
and:

$ mount -V
mount from util-linux 2.36 (libmount 2.36.0: selinux, smack, btrfs, namespaces, assert, debug)
$

And there is no such "noattr2 is deprecated" output. What version of
mount are you running?

What we really need from your system is debug that tells us exactly
what the mount option string that the mount command is handing the
mount syscall.

"attr2" != "noattr2"

The kernel is warning about a mount option being specified that
isn't even in the set emitted in /proc/mounts. Nor is it on your
command line. Yet the kernel is warning about it, and that implies
that mount has passed it to the kernel incorrectly.

Cheers,

Dave.
