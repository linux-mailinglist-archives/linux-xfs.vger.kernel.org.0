I'm a little confused by how we log EFIs for exactly the same records as
before while the above description says we leave off the claimed block
in the new EFI when it rolls. Does the roll in this scenario complete
the previous EFI(s) with an EFD and create a new EFI without the claimed
block? For example, suppose we do our bulk reservation and log the
necessary EFIs, start the rebuild, claim the first block, relog the
outstanding EFI without the claimed block, and then the system crashes.
What happens with the claimed block on subsequent recovery?

It's an optimization in some sense to prevent unnecessary relogs, but
the intent would be to avoid the need for a fixed count by notifying
when a relog is needed to a transaction that should be guaranteed to
have the reservation necessary to do so. I'm not sure it's worth the
complexity if there were some reason we still needed to fall back to a
hard count.

I'd start with just trying to reuse the logic in xlog_grant_push_ail()
(i.e. just factor out the AIL push). That function starts with a check
on available log reservation to filter out unnecessary pushes, then
calculates the AIL push LSN by adding the amount of log space we need to
free up to the current log tail. In this case we're not pushing the AIL,
but I think we'd be able to use the same threshold calculation logic to
determine when to relog intents that happen to reside within the range
from the current tail to the calculated threshold.
