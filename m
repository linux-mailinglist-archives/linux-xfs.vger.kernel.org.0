If it goes on top of whiteouts, it will need some modifications to
follow the new log item changes that the whiteout set makes.

Alternately, if the white out set goes in after the larp set, then it
will need to apply the new log item changes to xfs_attr_item.c as well

Looking forward, once we get the kernel patches worked out, we should
probably port the corresponding patches to xfsprogs before enabling the
feature.  I have a patch to print the new log item in a dump.  It's not
very complicated though, I don't think it will take too many reviews to
get through though.

It shouldn't.  When the feature is not enabled, it should not create
any intents.

I think patch 2 of this set is the same as patch 2 of the larp set.  If
you agree with the review results, you can just take patch 2 from the
larp series, and have 2 rvbs for this one

I'll see if I can stack the two sets together and get some reviews done
on the remainder of the set

Just from glancing at the sets, I don't think they have merge conflicts
other than patch 2, which can simply be dropped from one of the sets.

However, patches 3,4,6,7 of the whiteout set make a series of changes
to the xfs_*_item.c files.  So similar changes need to be applied to
the new fs/xfs/xfs_attr_item.c that the larp set introduces

I'll see if I can get a few perf captures on it too
