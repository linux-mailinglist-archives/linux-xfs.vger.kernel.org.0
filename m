I think we're going to have to detect the presence of pNFS exports and
EAGAIN if there are any active.  That probably involves incrementing a
counter during ->map_blocks and decreasing it during ->commit blocks.

That might still invite races between someone setting the fsuuid and
exporting via NFS.

I thought NFS (when not being used for block layouts and pnfs stuff)
still used the fsid that's also in the superblock?  Presumably we'd
leave the old m_fixedfsid unchanged while the fs is still mounted, and
document the caveat that handles will not work after a remount.

On some level, we might simply have to document that changing the
user-visible uuid will break file handles and pnfs exports, so sysadmins
had better get that done early.

OTOH that is an argument for leaving the xfs_db-based version that we
have now.

I would hope it's not so hard to detect that EVM/fscrypt are active on a
given xfs mount.  EVM seems pretty hard to detect since it operates
above the fs.

fscrypt might not be so difficult, since we likely need to add support
in the ondisk metadata, which means xfs will know.

IMA seems to be using it for rule matching, so I'd say that if the
sysadmin changes the fsuuid, they had better update the IMA rulebook
too.

Come to think of it, perhaps reading a filesystem's uuid (whether via
handle export, direct read of s_uuid, nfs, evm, ima, or fscrypt) should
set a superblock flag that someone has accessed it; and only if nobody's
yet accessed it do we allow the fsuuid update?

I don't know of any other than the ones you found.

Agreed.

Yeah, I think for the next iteration we ought to try to pull in Luis's
kernel-initiated-exclusive-freeze patch.

(No idea; once someone sets a fsuuid they usually don't want to go
back.)
