Rule of thumb: growing must always be done with devices that have
the same or smaller logical sector sizes. IOWs, the above will break
any filesystem that is formatted with alignment to the logical
sector size of 512 bytes...

Yes, because XFS has permanent metadata that is logical sector sized
and aligned. Hence if the device has a logical sector size of 512
at mkfs time, you will get this:

and that filesystem will not work on 4k physical/logical
storage devices.

if you start with 4k devices, mkfs.xfs will detect 4k
physical/logical devices and set it's sector size to 4k
automatically and hence will work on those devices, but you can't
change this retrospectively....

> xfs: is it possible to change the filesystem sector size?

Only at mkfs time.

Cheers,

Dave.
