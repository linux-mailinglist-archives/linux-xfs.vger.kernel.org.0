Thanks for pointing this out.

We no longer do this before the change count logic so that part of the
comment is bogus.

I am still a little confused why the lock is elided in other read cases,
such as this one or perhaps the similar check in xfs_bmbt_to_iomap()..?

Similarly, it looks like we set the ili_[flush|last]_lsn fields outside
of this lock (though last_lsn looks like it's also covered by ilock),
yet the update to the inode_log_item struct implies they should be
protected. What's the intent there?
