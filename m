Unfortunately, I am seeing some failures pop up with a fail rate of
~0.5-2% :( I typically end up rerunning failing tests up to 1000 times to
be confident about the failure rate on both the baseline and the backports
branch. Running each test 1000 times from the start is a bit much, but I
upped the test runs on both the baseline and backports branches to 100
runs per test to hopefully filter out some of the tests that fail more
consistently.

Personally, I don't think I would have much use for a git subtree. I have
been using expunges very sparingly - only for tests which cause crashes -
as I like to run even the failing tests to keep tabs on the failure rates.
