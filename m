I ran as root.

My point about analyzing the POC is that the first ioctl called,
XFS_IOC_SET_RESBLKS, requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN. So it is unsurprising
that nothing interesting happens as a normal user. This is an example
of pre-analysis that could have been done without any deep XFS
knowledge. It also greatly reduces any security concerns about the
flaw.

It does not.

It is hard to answer, but if you can run your POC from a fresh boot
and hit a KASAN error, that rules out prior corruption as the cause.

However, I have run the POC with your kernel version and your exact config
in a loop 2000x in my VM (after disabling panic on warn), with and without
other system load, and I hit no KASAN errors.
