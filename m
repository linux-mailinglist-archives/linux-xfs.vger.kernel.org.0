That might work. We'd just have to audit the external checks and provide
clear comments on the purpose of the lock in those cases.

Of course I'd expect some hit from the added serialization, but it's not
clear to me it would be as noticeable as an explicit lock in practice.
For example, if we had an XLOG_CIL_EMPTY bit that was set at push time
and had a test_and_clear_bit() in the commit/insert path, would we take
that hit every time through the commit path or only until the cpu clears
it or sees that it's been cleared?

I'm not familiar enough with the bitops implementation to have
expectations one way or the other, but I'd be happy to test it out if
you can share the tests used to produce the documented results. :)
