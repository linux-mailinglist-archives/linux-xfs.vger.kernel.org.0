Thanks Paul. I gave this a whirl with a ported variant of this patch on
top. There is definitely a notable improvement with the expedited grace
periods. A few quick runs of the same batched alloc/free test (i.e. 10
sample) I had run against the original version:

batch	baseline	baseline+bg	test	test+bg

1	889954		210075		552911	25540
4	879540		212740		575356	24624
8	924928		213568		496992	26080
16	922960		211504		518496	24592
32	844832		219744		524672	28608
64	579968		196544		358720	24128
128	667392		195840		397696	22400
256	624896		197888		376320	31232
512	572928		204800		382464	46080
1024	549888		174080		379904	73728
2048	522240		174080		350208	106496
4096	536576		167936		360448	131072

So this shows a major improvement in the case where the system is
otherwise idle. We still aren't quite at the baseline numbers, but
that's not really the goal here because those numbers are partly driven
by the fact that we unsafely reuse recently freed inodes in cases where
proper behavior would be to allocate new inode chunks for a period of
time. The core test numbers are much closer to the single threaded
allocation rate (55k-65k inodes/sec) on this setup, so that is quite
positive.

The "bg" variants are the same tests with 64 tasks doing unrelated
pathwalk listings on a kernel source tree (on separate storage)
concurrently in the background. The purpose of this was just to generate
background (rcu) activity in the form of pathname lookups and whatnot
and see how that impacts the results. This clearly affects both kernels,
but the test kernel drops down closer to numbers reminiscent of the
non-expedited grace period variant. Note that this impact seems to scale
with increased background workload. With a similar test running only 8
background tasks, the test kernel is pretty consistently in the
225k-250k (per 10s) range across the set of batch sizes. That's about
half the core test rate, so still not as terrible as the original
variant. ;)

In any event, this probably requires some thought/discussion (and more
testing) on whether this is considered an acceptable change or whether
we want to explore options to mitigate this further. I am still playing
with some ideas to potentially mitigate grace period latency, so it
might be worth seeing if anything useful falls out of that as well.
Thoughts appreciated...
