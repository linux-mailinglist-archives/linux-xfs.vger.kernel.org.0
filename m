I think we did this once, but then people disliked having the same call 
in two places.  We call the node function if XFS_DAS_RM_SHRINK is set OR 
if the other two cases fail which is actually the initial point of entry.

I think probably we need a comment somewhere.  I've realized every time 
a question gets re-raised, it means we need a comment so we dont forget 
why :-)

Maybe for the goto we can have:
/* If we are shrinking a node, resume shrink */

and.....

Not sure I quite follow what you mean here.  This little function is 
just a set up helper.  It doesnt jump in an out like the other functions 
do with the state machine.  We separated it out for that reason.  This 
routine executes once to stash the state. The da_state. not the 
dela_state.  Different states :-)

So after we have that stored away, the calling function moves onto
xfs_attr_node_remove_step, which does get recalled quite a bit until 
there are no more remote blocks to remove.

Initially I think I had another XFS_DAS_RMTVAL_REMOVE state for this. 
Alternatly we also discussed using the inverse like this:

if (dac->dela_state != XFS_DAS_RMTVAL_REMOVE)
	do setup....

Though I think people liked having the init flag, since init routines we 
a sort of re-occuring pattern.  So that's why were using the flag now.

Oh ok then, I did not know.  Will update the comment

Sure, it should be ok

Yes, I think I went over that a little in my replies to your earlier 
reviews.  Many times we can get away with out setting a state to 
accomplish the same behavior, though it may make it a little harder to 
visualize where it comes back.

I dunno this one seems like a preference in so far as what people want 
to see for simplification.  I think haveing the explicit state setting 
makes the code easier for a reader to follow, though I will concede they 
dont actually have to be there to make it work.

Well, ok, a lot of them are UNINIT.  If we continue in the direrction of 
removing all unnecessary states, really it's the combination of the tree 
and the state that actually lands us back to where we need to be when 
the function is recalled.

If, for debugging or readability purposes, we wanted an explicit state 
for each EAGAIN, we would reintroduce a lot of states we've simplifid 
away over the reviews.

Maybe give it a day or two to sleep on, and let me know what you think :-)

Thanks for the reviews, I know it's really complicated.
