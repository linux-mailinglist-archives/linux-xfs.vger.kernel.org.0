Any reason for xfs_trans_item_relog() when it's a one liner?

Urk.

I think I've got a better idea: rather than a counter, use something
meaningful as to whether the intent has been committed or not. e.g.
use something like xfs_log_item_in_current_chkpt() to determine if
we need to relog the intent.

i.e. If the intent is active in the CIL, then we don't need to relog
it. If the intent has been committed to the journal and is no longer
in the CIL list, relog it so the next CIL push will move it forward
in the journal.

The intent relogging functions look fine, though.

Cheers,

Dave.
