I know. I meant that the tests for verbs finsert/fcollapse can definitely use
generic as there are very few fs that support those verbs and those fs
should be fixed, not hide the failure.

cifs maintainer btw is using whitelists of tests for CI, so new
failing tests  are
not likely to affect cifs testing.

Let's wait to hear what Darrick has to say.
I just don't understand the incentive to hide test failures from buggy fs even
if this is a change of long time behavior.

BTW, here is untested draft of what I started working on:
https://github.com/amir73il/xfstests/commits/hints

With the new helpers, this test could also be classified as:

_suppoted_fs generic
_known_issue_on_fs ^xfs ^btrfs ^ext4

Meaning that the test runs on all fs, unless tester opts-out with
-x known_issues
and if test is run an fails an hint is printed:
"You _MAY_ be hit by a known issue on $FSTYP."

I'll probably be done with testing those patches and post them tomorrow.

Thanks,
Amir.
