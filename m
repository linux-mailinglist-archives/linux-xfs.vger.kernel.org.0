This is going to be a reverse-order review due to the way that diff
ordered the chunks, which means that the bulk of my questions are at the
end.

Ok, so if we're allocating space then this sets bc_free_longest to the
longer of the two remaining sections, if any.  But if we just allocated
the entirety of the longest extent in the cntbt, then we don't set
bc_free_longest, which means its zero, right?  I guess that's ok because
that implies there's zero space left in the AG, so the longest freespace
is indeed zero.

If we just allocated the entirety of a non-longest extent in the cntbt
then we don't call ->lastrec_update so the value of bc_free_longest
doesn't matter?

What happens in the haveleft && haveright case?  Shouldn't
bc_free_longest be set to ltlen + len + gtlen?  You could just push the
setting of bc_free_longest into the haveleft/haveright code below.

Humm.  In this case, we've called ->update_lastrec on the cntbt cursor
having deleted all the records in this record block.  Presumably that
means that we're going to add rec->alloc.ar_blockcount blocks to the
rightmost record in the left sibling of @block?  Or already have?

Ahh, right, the pagf_longest checks are done without holding AGF lock.
The concurrent creat call sees this intermediate state (DELREC sets
pagf_longest to zero, a moment later INSREC/UPDATE set it to the correct
nonzero value) and decides to ENOSPC because "nobody" has sufficient
free space.

I think this phony zero never gets written to disk because although
we're logging zero into the ondisk and incore agf_longest here, the next
btree operation will reset it to the correct value.  Right?

Would it be simpler to handle this case by duplicating the cntbt cursor
and walking one record leftward in the tree to find the longest extent,
rather than using this "bc_free_longest" variable?

This is only used for bnobt/cntbt trees, put it in the per-format
private data area, please.

If the answer to the question about duplicating the btree cursor is "no"
then I think this deserves a much longer comment that captures the fact
that the variable exists to avoid setting pagf_longest to zero for
benefit of the code that does unlocked scanning of AGs for free space.

I also wonder if the unlocked ag scan should just note that it observed
a zero pagf_longest and if no space can be found across all the AGs, to
try again with locks?
