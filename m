I'm not seeing regular problems with io_uring on my test machines.
Occasionally there will be a filesystem unmount issue, but that's
not causing anything but a single test here or there to fail. It's
not a big deal.

Yes, I've seen that happen in ~6.4 kernels, but current TOT doesn't
seem to do that anymore on my test machines.

Regardless, I don't think turning off io_uring support by default is
the right thing to do. That's just shooting the messenger. We really
do need this code to be exercised as much as possible because it is
so full of bugs. Sure, add a flag to turn it off if you need it off
(and add it to FSSTRESS_AVOID for your test environments), but
otherwise we really should be exercising io_uring. Ignorance doesn't
prevent bugs or CVEs....

Realistically, what we actually need is to require io_uring
developers to focus on testing io_uring functionality with
filesystems and fsstress and *to fix the regressions* rather than
endlessly adding more features and complexity that create more bugs. 
Turning the code off certainly won't help us acheive that....

Cheers,

Dave.
