large directory block size operations are assert failing because
xfs_bunmapi() is not completely removing fragmented directory blocks
like so:

We are aborting the bunmapi() pass because of this specific chunk of
code:

                /*
                 * Make sure we don't touch multiple AGF headers out of order
                 * in a single transaction, as that could cause AB-BA deadlocks.
                 */
                if (!wasdel && !isrt) {
                        agno = XFS_FSB_TO_AGNO(mp, del.br_startblock);
                        if (prev_agno != NULLAGNUMBER && prev_agno > agno)
                                break;
                        prev_agno = agno;
                }

This is designed to prevent deadlocks in AGF locking when freeing
multiple extents by ensuring that we only ever lock in increasing
AG number order. Unfortunately, this also violates the "bunmapi will
always succeed" semantic that some high level callers depend on,
such as xfs_dir2_shrink_inode(), xfs_da_shrink_inode() and
xfs_inactive_symlink_rmt().

This AG lock ordering was introduced back in 2017 to fix deadlocks
triggered by generic/299 as reported here:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/800468eb-3ded-9166-20a4-047de8018582@gmail.com/

This codebase is old enough that it was before we were defering all
AG based extent freeing from within xfs_bunmapi(). THat is, we never
actually lock AGs in xfs_bunmapi() any more - every non-rt based
extent free is added to the defer ops list, as is all BMBT block
freeing. And RT extents are not RT based, so there's no lock
ordering issues associated with them.

Hence this AGF lock ordering code is both broken and dead. Let's
just remove it so that the large directory block code works reliably
again.

Tested against xfs/538 and generic/299 which is the original test
that exposed the deadlocks that this code fixed.
