Please, no.

The problem with this is that a specific "tune" will need to vary
over time (e.g. when reflink is supported with DAX) and so now we
back to the same situation where the definition of "tune=dax"
changes depending on what version of mkfs you use. Hence you can
still make a filesystem that the kernel won't mount because you have
a xfsprogs that supports DAX+reflink and a kernel that doesn't.

I just don't see this as a viable way to produce filesystems that
work for specific situations because it doesn't solve the kernel vs
xfsprogs version support issue that requires tweaking mkfs
parameters manually to avoid...

Let's fix that, then. I've written a bunch of stuff in the past
couple of years that uses basic ini config files via a simple
library and it just works. If people are happy with ini format
config files via a library, then I'll just go do that, eh?

Cheers,

Dave.
