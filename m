I guess here is the <patch> you are speaking of. So this prevents from
exposing nulls within a file in case of a crash.

I guess the behavior is not the same with ext4. ext4 does not seem to be
doing filemap_write_and_wait_range() if the new i_disksize is more than
oldsize. So then I think ext4 must be ok if in case of a crash the
file has nulls in between. That's why I think the observation of slow
performance is not seen in ext4.

Few queres-
- If the user doesn't issue a flush and if the system crashes, then
  anyways it is not expected that the file will have all the data right?

- Also is that "data/inode size update order" which you are mentioning in
  this patch. Is this something that all filesystems should follow?

- I was wondering what exactly it breaks which the applications depend
  upon? Because not all filesystems tend to follow this practice right?


Thanks for the detailed explaination! I got interested in this thread
after looking at your explaination and since the thread mention this
happens with postgres.

<patch>
[XFS] Fix inode size update before data write in xfs_setattr

When changing the file size by a truncate() call, we log the change in the
inode size. However, we do not flush any outstanding data that might not
have been written to disk, thereby violating the data/inode size update
order. This can leave files full of NULLs on crash.

Hence if we are truncating the file, flush any unwritten data that may lie
between the curret on disk inode size and the new inode size that is being
logged to ensure that ordering is preserved.
