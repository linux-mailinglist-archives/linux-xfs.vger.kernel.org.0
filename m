Forgive me if I'm missing something obvious but isn't this added check redundant?

If mnt_type == "autofs" then mnt_type != MNTTYPE_XFS and we're ignoring it
already in this loop, no?  In this case, the loop is for xfs_fsr so we are really
only ever going to be looking for xfs mounts, as opposed to fs_table_initialise_mounts
which may accept "foreign" (non-xfs) filesystems.

Same sort of question here, but I don't know what these autofs entries look like.
Can their "device" (mnt_fsname) begin with "/" ?

Backing up a bit, which xfsprogs utility saw this behavior with autofs mounts?

I'm mostly ok with just always and forever filtering out anything that matches
"autofs" but if it's unnecessary (like the first case I think?) it may lead
to confusion for future code readers.

Thanks,
