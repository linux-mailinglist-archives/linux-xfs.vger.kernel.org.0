Yeah.  I'm sorry for the role I played in that, though later Eric and I
sorted out quota stuff.  I have burned out and I need to stop working
50+ hour weeks.  *After* I stopped being maintainer and dropped 30% of
my workload, I thought I'd feel better, but instead:

The biggest problem right now is that the pagecache is broken in 5.18
and apparently I'm the only person who can trigger this.  It's the same
problem willy and I have been working on since -rc1 (where the
filemap/iomap debug asserts trip on generic/068 and generic/475) that's
documented on the fsdevel list.  Unfortunately, I don't have much time
to work on this, because as team lead:

Every week I have to go teach a new person how reflink works, and how to
make VM disk image reflinking not stall the VM until it gets evicted by
the cluster manager.  They haven't fixed the problem yet, but every week
I can start over with a new person who isn't familiar with the situation
at all.

No matter how many distro bugs I clear per week, the same number of new
reports are filed.  Almost all of them have me chasing corner cases and
things that you'd think people wouldn't do, but no, tomorrow I have to
teach people that the fs will crash and burn **when they unplug the
storage**.  You'd think I could just close these things, but then people
fight me on that, they argue with me about how this or that works on
XFS, and when I tell them they're wrong, they just say "Are you sure??"

Syzbot.  At least the Hulk Robot people actually send patches.

That attr fork UAF thing -- adding smp_wmb/rmb made the symptoms go
away, but as I was writing up the commit message I realized that the
race window is still there.  Maybe I'll come up with a way to make the
incore attr fork stick around, though both attempts so far have exploded
on impact.

Every week I lose somewhere between 10-70 emails because of some
combination of overzealous spam filters on my kernel.org account, IT
logging me out of random things, and Outlook.  I never have any idea if
anyone is trying to reach me.

Also the furnace is failing and I need to replace that.  $spouse has
handled most of it but it's hard to get contractors to give us
estimates, and between that and weeks of tax return preparation hell
(five different jurisdictions, five separate calculations and five
separate returns!  Thanks, US tax system!) there's nothing left.

This whole quota warning thing has dragged on longer than necessary
because I'm wiped out and do not know or have the mental energy to
figure out how to deprecate this feature.  I'll ack whatever people send
to make it go away.

Sorry everyone.  I probably should not come back.  I will not be
attending LSFMM, not even virtually.  I don't have the mental health to
pull that off.
