I've been testing a new patch that rips out all of this in favor of
stealing the unused block reservation from the transaction that the log
item recovery function creates instead of this hokey AG iteration mess.
The results look promising, and I think I'll do this instead.

Granted, this now means that log intent item recovery must be very
careful to reserve enough blocks for the entire chain of operations that
could be created.  This shouldn't be too heavy a lift since we don't
have that many intent types yet, and at least at first glance the
resblks we ask for now looked ok to me.
