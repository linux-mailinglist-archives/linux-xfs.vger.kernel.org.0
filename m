Ahaha, yep, a stupid bug in my script that turns stgit patches into
branches for pushing to kernel.org.  It ought to be sorting topics in
the order that the tagged patches appear in the stgit branch, but
clearly it isn't doing that for generating pull requests.

I'll sort this out and resend.  Unless you'd rather just pull #20 and
only have to do that once?

Either way, I'll fix my dumb script.
