Ideally, but that ideas in that patch series have been floating around

I haven't tried to look at this yet. I did check that the pte_devmap()
flag can be deleted, but this is more tricky.

We have pmd_huge(), pmd_large(), pmd_devmap(), pmd_trans_huge(),
pmd_leaf(), at least

and I couldn't tell you today the subtle differences between all of
these things on every arch :\

AFAIK there should only be three case:
 - pmd points to a pte table
 - pmd is in the special hugetlb format
 - pmd points at something described by struct page(s)

Yes, it is a tricky job to do the full work, but I think in the end,
'pmd points at something described by struct page(s)' is enough for
all code to use is_zone_device_page() instead of a PTE bit or VMA flag
to drive its logic.

I am explaining this wrong, the immediate need is really 'should
foll_longterm fail fast-gup to the slow path' and something like the
nvdimm driver can just set that to 1 and rely on VMA flags to control
what the slow path does - as is today.

It is not as elegant as more flags in the pgmap, but it would get the
job done with minimal fuss.

Might be nice to either rely fully on VMA flags or fully on pgmap
holder flags for FOLL_LONGTERM?

It is where this series came from. As DEVICE_COHERENT is focused on
changing the migration code and, as I recall, the 1 == free thing
complicated that enough that Christoph requested it be cleaned.

I understood there was some community that was interested in DAX on
other arches that don't have the PTE bits to spare, so this would be
of interest to them?

Indeed, I don't think that will help many of the stuck items on the
list move ahead.
