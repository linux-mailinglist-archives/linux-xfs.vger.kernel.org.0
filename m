Ok, so what Carlos and I found last night was an issue with the
the agresv code leading to the maximum free extent calculated
by xfs_alloc_longest_free_extent() being longer than the largest
allowable extent allocation (mp->m_ag_max_usable) resulting in the
situation where blen > args->maxlen, and so in the case of initial
allocation here, we never run this:

	/*
	 * Adjust for alignment
	 */
	if (blen > args.alignment && blen <= args.maxlen)
		args.minlen = blen - args.alignment;
	args.minalignslop = 0;

this is how we end up with args.minlen = args.maxlen and the
initial allocation failing.

The issue is the way mp->m_ag_max_usable is calculated versus how
the pag->pag_meta_resv.ar_reserved value is set up for the finobt.
That is, "ask" = max tree size, and "used" = 1 because we have a
root block allocated. that code does:

	mp->m_ag_max_unused -= ask;
...
	pag->pag_meta_resv.ar_reserved = ask - used

That means when we calculate the longest extent in the AG, we do:

	longest = pag->pagf_longest - min_needed - resv(NONE)
		= pag->pagf_longest - min_needed - pag->pag_meta_resv.ar_reserved

whilst mp->m_ag_max_usable is calculated as

	usable = agf_length - AG header blocks - AGFL - resv(ask)

When the AG is empty, this ends up with

	pag->pagf_longest = agf_length - AG header blocks
and
	min_needed = AGFL blocks
and
	resv(ask) = pag->pag_meta_resv.ar_reserved + 1

and so:
	longest = usable + 1

And that's how we get blen = maxlen + 1, and that's why alignment is
being dropped for the initial allocation in this "allocate full AG"
corner case.

Right, we'll continue to fail until minlen is reduced appropriately.
But that's not an issue in the fallback algorithms, that's a problem
with the initial conditions not being set up correctly.

AFAICT this is not necessary. The prototypoe patch I wrote last
night while working through this with Carlos is attached below. I
updated with a variant of your patch 2 to demonstrate that it does
actually solve the problem of full AG allocation failing to be
aligned.

Cheers,

xfs: cap longest free extent to maximum allocatable

From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

Cap longest extent to the largest we can allocate based on limits
calculated at mount time. Dynamic state (such as finobt blocks)
can result in the longest free extent exceeding the size we can
allocate, and that results in failure to align full AG allocations
when the AG is empty.

Result:

xfs_io-4413  [003]   426.412459: xfs_alloc_vextent_loopfailed: dev 8:96 agno 0 agbno 32 minlen 243968 maxlen 244000 mod 0 prod 1 minleft 1 total 262148 alignment 32 minalignslop 0 len 0 type NEAR_BNO otype START_BNO wasdel 0 wasfromfl 0 resv 0 datatype 0x5 firstblock 0xffffffffffffffff

minlen and maxlen are now separated by the alignment size, and
allocation fails because args.total > free space in the AG.

Update: add a hacked version of Brian's xfs_bmapi_write() args.total
hack to actually allow this initial aligned allocation to succeed:

Note that it skips AG 1 now because AG 0 is not the AG with the
longest free space - it's got a root inode chunk in it so it has
less space in it than the other AGs. Hence it can't do a maximally
sized aligned allocation, while AG 1 can. Note the difference in
total compared to the initial trace above.
