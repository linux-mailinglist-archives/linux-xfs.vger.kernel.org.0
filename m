That's a difficult project -- some of the things repair will complain
about are a result of whatever the upgrade is (e.g. complaining about
incorrect inode btree counters when you're in the process of enabling
the counters) but then there are other things that it probably should
not be dropping on the floor.

Yeah, xfs_admin should not add '=1'. Thanks for pointing that out.

Thx :)

~6mo after we hear that people are using the feature /and/ we haven't
heard of any serious complaints.

Or some distro makes a business case and enables it by default. <cough>
