We have xfs_da3_swap_lastblock() that can leave an -empty- da block
between the last referenced block and isize, but that's not a "hole"
in the file. If you don't mean xfs_da3_swap_lastblock(), then can
you clarify what you mean by a "hole" here and explain to me how the
situation it occurs in comes about? 

Cheers,

Dave.
