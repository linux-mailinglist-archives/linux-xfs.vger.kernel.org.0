Subject: xfs/076 takes a long long time testing with a realtime volume

After committing some exclusions into my test runner framework (see
below), I tested a potential fix to xfs/076 which disables the
real-time volume when creating the scratch volume.  Should I send it
as a formal patch to fstests?

    test-appliance: exclude xfs/076 from the realtime configs
    
    The xfs/076 test takes two minutes on a normal xfs file system (e.g.,
    a normal 4k block size file system).  However, when there is a
    real-time volume attached, this test takes over 80 minutes.  The
    reason for this seems to be because the test is spending a lot more
    time failing to create files due to missing directories.  Compare:
    
    root@xfstests-2:~# ls -sh /results/xfs/results-4k/xfs/076.full
    48K /results/xfs/results-4k/xfs/076.full
    root@xfstests-2:~# ls -sh /tmp/realtime-076.full
    25M /tmp/realtime-076.full
    
    and:
    
    root@xfstests-2:~# grep "cannot touch" /results/xfs/results-4k/xfs/076.full | wc -l
    656
    root@xfstests-2:~# grep "cannot touch" /tmp/realtime-076.full | wc -l
    327664
    
    The failures from 076.full look like this:
    
    touch: cannot touch '/xt-vdc/offset.21473722368/25659': No space left on device
    touch: cannot touch '/xt-vdc/offset.21473656832/0': No such file or directory
    touch: cannot touch '/xt-vdc/offset.21473591296/0': No such file or directory
    ...
    touch: cannot touch '/xt-vdc/offset.196608/0': No such file or directory
    touch: cannot touch '/xt-vdc/offset.131072/0': No such file or directory
    touch: cannot touch '/xt-vdc/offset.65536/0': No such file or directory
    touch: cannot touch '/xt-vdc/offset.0/0': No such file or directory
    
    What seems to be going on is that xfs/076 tries to create a small
    scratch file system --- but when we attach a real-time volume this
    balloons the available size of the file system.  Of course, that space
    can't be used for normal files.  As a result, xfs/076 is incorrectly
    estimating how many files it needs to create to fill the file system.
    
    I'm not sure what's the best way to fix this in the test; perhaps the
    test should forcibly unset SCRATCH_RTDEV environment variable before
    running _scratch_mkfs?  Anyway, for now, we'll just skip running
    xfs/076 for the xfs/realtime* configs.
