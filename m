That's not a directory operation that tripped over. :/

Yeah, so I missed that xfs_defer_add() will combine like types into
the the same list if they are consecutively logged. I was looking at
intent creation being limited to one intent per deferred operation,
but missed the aggregation at queuing time.

But this is largely irrelevant to the operation of bunmapi, because
it's just queuing extents to be freed, not running the transactions
that free them...

Nope, now that I look at it, the EFI intent creation sorts the
queued extents to be freed into ascending AG order, so they'll
always be freed in an order that allows for correct AG locking order
in the freeing transaction. IOWs, we still don't need AG ordering
anywhere in the bunmapi path, because AG ordering is done at the
intent level where ordering might matter...

Yup. Seems that way, but there's not deadlock issue with doing this
because of the sorting. That's an issue for transaction reservations
for EFI processing, but these days that is not something that
bunmapi has to care about.

Cheers,
