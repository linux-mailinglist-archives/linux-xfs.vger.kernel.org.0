Er, no, because the worker could also get preempted right after
complete() and take so long to get rescheduled that the the inode have
been reclaimed.  Think about it -- the original thread is waiting on the
completion that it passed to the worker through $args, and therefore the
worker cannot touch any of the resources it was accessing through $args
after calling complete()....
