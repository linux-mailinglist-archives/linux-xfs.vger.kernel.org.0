Likely - I recognised this granularity problem, though:

| buffered writes, then maybe we can enlarge the bitmap further.

We could also hash offsets into the bitmap so that offset-local IO
hit different locks - the bit lock doesn't necessarily need to be
range based. i.e. this is a "finer grained" lock that will typically
increase concurrency. If we keep striving for perfect (i.e. scalable
range locks) we're not going to improve the situation any time
soon...

The biggest problem with this is that direct IO will -not- do
folio-by folio locking, and so folio based locking does not work for
direct IO exclusion. Currently we get coherency against buffered
writes by writing back or invalidation dirty folios before doing
the DIO read/write. Because we hold the IOLOCK shared, a buffered
write will not redirty the page cache until the DIO write has been
submitted (and completed for non-async DIO).

Hence moving to shared i_rwsem, folio-based range locking for
buffered writes will lose all serialisation against DIO operations.
We will lose what coherency we currently have between buffered write
ops and DIO, and I don't think that's an acceptible trade-off.

i.e. The problem with using the mapping tree for DIO coherency is,
once again, locking overhead. If we have to insert exceptional
entries to lock the range in the mapping tree because there is no
folio present (for DIO to serialise against new buffered IOs), then
we are simply back to the same exclusive tree update scalability
problem that tree based range lock algorithms have....

That's why I suggested a bitmap lock external to both buffered and
direct IO...

Maybe, but I don't think folio/mapping tree based locking is a
workable solution. Hence the external bitmap idea...
