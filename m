The Open Group spec says (for file writes) that "Upon successful
completion, where nbyte is greater than 0, write() shall mark for update
the last data modification and last file status change timestamps of the
file, and if the file is a regular file, the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits of
the file mode may be cleared."

I think XFS (and ocfs2) interpret fallocate calls as a file write, since
punch/zero/collapse/insert directly change the file contents and
extending the length changes what you get if you read() the entire file.
If nothing else, xfs updates the ctime for any fallocate request.  This
might be overkill for preallocating into the middle of a file, but for
the rest I think it's necessary.

That's the reason I can come up with for why these two filesystems
remove the suid/sgid bits on fallocate.
