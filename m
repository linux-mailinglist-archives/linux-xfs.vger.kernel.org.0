X-SRS-Rewrite: SMTP reverse-path rewritten from <hch@infradead.org> by bombadil.infradead.org. See http://www.infradead.org/rpr.html

We can just move the code directly to xfs_file_release.  Additionally
remove the pointless i_mode verification, and the error returns that
are entirely ignored by the calller of ->release.
