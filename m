Hi all,

I've been working on online fsck for years, and hardening offline fsck
whenever I notice easy to fix discrepancies between the two tools.  Now
that it's been a couple of years since I've seen any problems, I think
it's time to open this to wider testing by dropping /some/ of the
"dangerous" tags.

While working on this I also noticed that some of the fuzz tests were
misclassified, so this patchset fixes those problems too.

If you're going to start using this code, I strongly recommend pulling
from my git trees, which are linked below.

With a bit of luck, this should all go splendidly.
Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
