Hi Brian,

Thank you for your response.

I apologize for the confusion. By "freed" I really meant "taken off
the LRU". I am aware of the fact that b_hold is controlling whether
the buffer will be freed or not.

What I meant is that the commit description does not address the issue
accurately. From the description one can understand that the only
problem is the additional trip through the LRU.
But in fact, due to this issue, buffers will spend one cycle less in
the LRU than intended. If we initialize b_lru_ref to X, we intend the
buffer to survive X shrinker calls, and on the X+1'th call to be taken
off the LRU (and maybe freed). But with this issue, the buffer will be
taken off the LRU and immediately re-added back. But this will happen
X-1 times, because on the X'th time the b_lru_ref will be 0, and the
buffer will not be readded to the LRU. So the buffer will survive X-1
shrinker calls and not X as intended.

Furthermore, if somehow we end up with the buffer sitting on the LRU
and having b_lru_ref==0, this buffer will never be taken off the LRU,
due to the bug. I am not sure this can happen, because by default
b_lru_ref is set to 1.

Will do.

Thanks,
