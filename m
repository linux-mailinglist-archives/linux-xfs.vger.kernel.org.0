Ok, but I should have showed you another example with a smaller stripe unit,
sorry.  4k sector device:

# mkfs.xfs -f /dev/sdh

          =                       crc=1        finobt=1, sparse=1, rmapbt=0

we're only ignoring the device geometry on 4k devices, for the reason indicated
in my original email.

That's not my complaint though. I do think that if we auto-reduce, we should
not emit warnings the user can't do anything about.  Hence my change. ;)

we actually still do. Just not on 4k drives.

Ok, but surely it should not differ between 512b and 4k devices.
That was my (poorly communicated) concern.
