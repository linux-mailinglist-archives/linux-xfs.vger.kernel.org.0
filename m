We flush the data device before writing the first iclog (containing
XLOG_START_TRANS) to the disk. This satisfies the first ordering constraint
listed above. Why is it required to have another REQ_PREFLUSH when writing the
iclog containing XLOG_COMMIT_TRANS? I am guessing that it is required to
make sure that the previous iclogs (belonging to the same checkpoint
transaction) have indeed been written to the disk.
