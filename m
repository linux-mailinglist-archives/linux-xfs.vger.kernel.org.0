I wouldn't want anyone to spend more time on fuzzer issues and
I myself have given those very little attention.
My expectation is to always have a Fixes tag when a developer
knows they are fixing a regression and best effort when it is easy
for the developer to determine when the buggy code was merged.

It doesn't even have to be in the form of a Fixes tag.
If the cover letter says "fixes to the $FEATURE from v5.18"
that is good enough for me.

As a stable maintainer, if a commit has no Fixes tag and no hint
in the cover letter about relevant kernel versions, I will assume
it is relevant to the LTS kernel and spend time on the manual triage.
If a developer adds a Fixes tag where relevant, that can save my
time by eliminating commits irrelevant for e.g. 5.10.y.
This wasn't the case in this series I guess.

Yes. The reason I did not pick any of the commits in this series for 5.10
is not because lack of Fixes/tests, but because I read the cover letters
(thanks for the links Leah!) and commit messages and conclude that
the risk/effort does not make the cut.

But this conclusion was based very much on my own intuition and my
own interpretation of the cover letters. This is why I asked Chandan to
take another look.

I encourage any developer who writes a cover letter to share their
own opinion about the relevancy and risks associated with backporting
their patch set to LTS kernels - make it as vague statement as you
wish, anything that can help a human LTS maintainer do their job better.

Thanks,
Amir.
