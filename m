Yeah, you are right.

ok.

My personal thought is also incremental approach. since I'm currently
looking at shrinking a whole unused AG, but such whole modification
is all over the codebase, so the whole shrink function would be better
to be built step by step.

Yeah, I also think XFS_DEBUG or another experimential build config
is needed.

Considering that, I think it would better to seperate into 2 functions
as Darrick suggested in the next version to avoid too many
#ifdef XFS_DEBUG #endif hunks.
