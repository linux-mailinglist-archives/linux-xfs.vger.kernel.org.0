Yuck, no.

Yes, that requires mapping lookups above the iomap layer, then
repeating them again in the iomap layer and having to juggle the
locking to ensure the iomap code gets the same result.  This also
requires taking the ILOCK to decide how to lock the IOLOCK, which
inverts all the IO path locking in nasty, bug prone ways. We tried
very hard to get rid of all those layering violations and lock
dances in the IO path with iomap - the old DIO code was a never
ending source of locking bugs because we had to play locking games
like this....

As I explained quickly on #xfs over xmas/ny time - because it seems
like 4 or 5 people all asked for this at the same time - I suspect
we can do this with IOMAP_NOWAIT directives for unaligned IO under
shared locking.

That is, if the unaligned dio is going to require allocation or
sub-block zeroing or would otherwise block, the filesystem mapping
code returns EAGAIN to iomap_apply() which propagates back to the
filesystem submitting the DIO which can then take exclusive lock and
resubmit the unaligned DIO, this time without the nowait semantics.

Cheers,

Dave.
