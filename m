I don't think check-parallel needs to start each check instance in
it's own PID namespace - it's the tests themselves that need the
isolation from each other.

However, the check instances require a private mount namespace, as
they mount and unmount test/scratch devices themselves and we do not
want other check instances seeing those mounts.

Hence I think the current check-parallel code doing mount namespace
isolation as it already does should work with this patch enabling
per-test process isolation inside check itself.

Yeah, I think tearing down the mount namespace (i.e. exiting the
process that nsexec created) drops the last active reference to the
mounts inside the private namespace and so it gets torn down that
way.

So from my perspective, I think your check-helper namespace patch is
a good improvement and I'll build/fix anything I come across on top
of it. Once your series of fixes goes in, I'll rebase all the stuff
I've got on top it and go from there...

Yet another dead-end in the poorly sign-posted rat-hole, eh?
