Yes, your observation is correct. I will remove the file mode and fork type
checks.

Yes, To provide more clarity, I should replace the above comment with
following,

  /*
   * -ENOSPC is returned since a directory entry remove operation must not fail
   * due to low extent count availability. -ENOSPC will be handled by higher
   * layers of XFS by letting the corresponding empty Data/Free blocks to linger

   * the last block in the leaf space and then the new last block will be
   * unmapped.
   *
   * The above logic also applies to the source directory entry of a rename
   * operation.

Sure, I will add that.

The following code snippet from xfs_da_shrink_inode() does the special casing
only for the data fork i.e. for blocks holding directory entries.

   for (;;) {
           /*
            * Remove extents.  If we get ENOSPC for a dir we have to move
            * the last block to the place we want to kill.
            */
           error = xfs_bunmapi(tp, dp, dead_blkno, count,
                               xfs_bmapi_aflag(w), 0, &done);
           if (error == -ENOSPC) {
                   if (w != XFS_DATA_FORK)
                           break;
                   error = xfs_da3_swap_lastblock(args, &dead_blkno,
                                                 &dead_buf);

So this facility is available only for directory entries.

Hence for xattrs, if we ever reach the extent count limit, the only way out is
to delete the corresponding file.

I think you are right about that. I will split this patch according to what
you have mentioned above.
