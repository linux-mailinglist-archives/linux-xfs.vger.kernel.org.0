I tried converting this and it wasn't as easy as I thought.

The downside is that now we have a function that sometimes consumes the
transaction and the ILOCK, and there's still the question of what to do
if xfs_inode_free_quota_blocks doesn't find any space to free.

By leaving all the ugliness in the call sites, we maintain the property
that the function that allocates the transaction and ilocks the inode
also gets to iunlock and free the tp, and we can also skip the retry if
the eofblocks flush doesn't clear anything.

It might be easier to rework this as a xfs_trans_alloc_quota function
wherein you feed it a tres, the inode, the number of blocks you want,
and whether or not this is an rt extent; and either it reserves and
locks everything for you, or returns failure.  The downside is that
doesn't work for reflink since it doesn't always require quota
reservation to remap an extent.

But it's pretty late in the day and my brain is scrambled eggs so I'll
defer until tomorrow.
