Yup, but now I think of it, xfs_allocfree_log_count() doesn't seem
right for freeing, and I need to check how allocation works again
because stuff gets deferred.

i.e. on freeing, AFAICT we don't modify the freespace trees, the reflink
tree and the rmap trees all in the same transaction. We do a cycle
that looks like this:

log new intent, commit, execute the intent, log the intent done,
log new intent, commit, execute the intent, log the intent done,
log new intent, commit, ....

And so I'm not sure that we are modifying the reflink, rmap and free
space trees all in the same transaction and commit.

This isn't anything to do with an EFI at this point. It's just the
reservation needed to remove a single extent from a single AG in
isolation. I wanted to isolate this reservation completely from the
rest of the transaction reservations and how it ends up being used.

This deadlock surprised me, and so reflection and insight has lead
me to think that we actually need our reservations to reflect the
specific operations that will be performed by the transaction rather
than an aggregation of things that get modified.

Then each reservation can contain the reservations for each
operation it performance (e.g. free an extent) 

That's kinda what this "intent needs it's own reservation"

THe reason is that itruncate used to allow 4 extents to be freed in
a single transaction. i.e. XFS_ITRUNC_MAX_EXTENTS used to be defined
to 4, it is now 2.

However, if you want to relate this to EFIs, I think this
reservation is completely bogus. If all the extents freed a single
BMBT extent free are packed into a single EFI (i.e. all the BMBT
blocks freed and the data extent) then we'll overrun the reservation
extent count of 4. The max extents being freed in a single
BMBT extent free operations is a full bmbt merge + the data extent.
i.e. XFS_BM_MAXLEVELS + 1 extents in a single EFI. Except that
we're allowed to pack two data extent frees into a single EFI, and
that means it is, worst case, a full BMBT merge + a BMBT merge up to
level below root + 2 data extents, or:

= (XFS_BM_MAXLEVELS + 1) + ((XFS_BM_MAXLEVELS - 1 - 1) + 1)
= XFS_BM_MAXLEVELS * 2 extents

And then we try to free all those extents in a single itruncate unit
reservation. We probably don't hit this often because the maximum
BMBT level is bound by filesystem size, and it's rare to have a >=
4-level BMBT tree needed to make this problematic.  We do not have a
reservation large enough to do that as a single transaction, and we
don't want to have a reservation that large, either.

This is not a limitation of the EFI/EFD construct - that can
effectively be unbound. The limitation is that we don't roll and
relog the EFD between each extent in the EFI that we free. The
itruncate reservation has a bound limit for freeing extents, the
EFI reservation does not define that.

So, really, I think our extent free reservations and some of the
intent execution behaviour needs a serious audit and rework, and we
need to decouple the extent allocation and freeing reservations as
extent allocation is now a fundamentally different operation to
freeing an extent. i.e. Allocation does BMBT, refcount, rmap and
freespace tree mods all in one transaction, while freeing does
multiple individual transactional modifications linked by chained
intents.

Oh, yeah, I'm well aware of it - ISTR commenting on it past
discussions about the transaction reservation sizes being much
larger than necessary....
