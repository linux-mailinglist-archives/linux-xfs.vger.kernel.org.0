I was wondering as to why the above described bug does not occur when
allocating blocks via xfs_bmap_btalloc(). This led me to the following,

1. When using xfs_bmap_btalloc() to allocate a directory block,
   xfs_bmalloca->total is set to total number of fs blocks required for the
   transaction to complete successfully. This includes blocks required to
   allocate
   - Data block
   - Free index block
   - Dabtree blocks and
   - Bmbt blocks.

2. Most of the time (please refer to step #5 for a description of the
   exceptional case), xfs_bmap_btalloc() chooses an AG for space allocation
   only when the AG has atleast xfs_bmalloca->total number of free blocks. On
   finding such an AG, the corresponding AGF buffer is locked by the
   transaction and this guarantees that the fs blocks that make up a directory
   block are allocated from within the same AG. This is probably the reason
   for xfs_dir2_shrink_inode() to assume that __xfs_bunmapi() will be able to
   unmap all the constituent fs blocks.

3. The call trace posted above occurs when __xfs_bunmapi() starts unmapping
   the fs blocks of a directory block and one of the fs blocks happens to be
   from an AG whose AG number is less than that of fs block that was unmapped
   earlier.

4. The xfs_bmap_exact_minlen_extent_alloc() allocator can cause allocation of
   a directory block whose constituent fs blocks are from different AGs. This
   occurs because,
   - xfs_bmap_exact_minlen_extent_alloc() gets an AG which has atleast
     xfs_bmalloca->total free fs blocks.
   - However some of those free fs blocks do not correspond to one-block sized
     extents (NOTE: xfs/538 test fragments 90% of the fs free space).
   - Once the current AG runs out of one-block sized extents, we move onto the
     next AG. This happens because xfs_bmap_exact_minlen_extent_alloc() uses
     XFS_ALLOCTYPE_FIRST_AG as the allocation type and this in turn causes the
     allocator code to iterate across AGs to get free blocks.

5. From code reading, I noticed that the scenario described in step #4 could
   also occur when using xfs_bmap_btalloc(). This happens when the filesystem
   is highly fragmented and is also running low on free space. In such a
   scenario, XFS_TRANS_LOWMODE is enabled causing xfs_bmap_btalloc() to
   execute the same sequence of steps described in step #4. This scenario
   (i.e. fragmented fs and running low on free space) is probably quite rare
   to occur in practice and hence this may be the reason as to why this
   problem was not observed earlier.
