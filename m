I don't use checkpatch so I don't care about all the idiotic
"crusade of the month" stuff it is always whining about.

Seems reasonable to hide that behind a typedef. No idea how to set
it up and test it, though, and I don't really have time right now.
I'll change it to a typedef to make this easier to do in future,
