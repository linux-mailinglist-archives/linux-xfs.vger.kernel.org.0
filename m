From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

When a v4 filesystem has fl_last - fl_first != fl_count, we do not
not detect the corruption and allow the AGF to be used as it if was
fully valid. On V5 filesystems, we reset the AGFL to empty in these
cases and avoid the corruption at a small cost of leaked blocks.

If we don't catch the corruption on V4 filesystems, bad things
happen later when an allocation attempts to trim the free list
and either double-frees stale entries in the AGFl or tries to free
NULLAGBNO entries.

Either way, this is bad. Prevent this from happening by using the
AGFL_NEED_RESET logic for v4 filesysetms, too.
