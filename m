Ouch, thanks for that explanation. I now get why and how this really is =
either
a log-related or even general dirty/writeback flushing issue. We =
definitely
have some quite sub-optimal settings here - so I=E2=80=99m revisiting =
our dirty/writeback=20
settings and XFS journal sizes. My understanding is that (in our
situation) those should be sized based on the backing storage =
performance -
so typically we=E2=80=99ll end up with fixed sizes independent of the =
available
RAM or volume size that will guarantee an upper bound for worst case
of flushing/processing.

However, I=E2=80=99m still a bit puzzled why this has escalated to =
user-visible
incidents in the last weeks - we=E2=80=99ve been running with those =
sub-optimal
settings for a very long time and haven=E2=80=99t had these issues =
before.

I took some time to educate myself further around the writeback =
behaviour
and noticed the special relationship with that keeps getting mentioned
between writeback and cgroups and those are in play with our setup, so
maybe it=E2=80=99s worth another look.=20

Whenever this issue hits us, the system is running one of two system
management tasks where one performs garbage collection on the nix store
(which typically contains multiple generations of all packages on the
system) and the other builds out a new system config. Those jobs are run =
in
separate cgroups and throttled at 31 RW IOPS (12.5% of 250) and 188 RW =
IOPS
(75% of 250). Those jobs aren=E2=80=99t time critical at all, so we want =
to leave
sufficient IOPS to not starve the actual workload.

Those jobs run relatively often without causing issues, but then =
they=E2=80=99re
also lazy. Still, even when they do work they do not always cause those
issues. If they do, then i can see a sudden spike in our telemetry for
dirty pages (around 300-400 MiB typically) followed by a jump in =
writeback
pages (which is typically a bit higher: around 200 MiB more than dirty =
pages).

So far so good - that=E2=80=99s expected behaviour: one of the jobs =
might be deleting
a lot of files - so that=E2=80=99s lots of metadata operations in the =
journal,
and the other typically extracts archives, so many new files with =
different sizes.

Here=E2=80=99s why I think there might be a bug lurking (or I=E2=80=99m =
still missing something):

When the journal in a volume is relatively small (10 MiB) but the amount =
of
data in writeback is around 450 MiB this indicates regular file content
being flushed. I only see 3 mib/s at around 100 iops (indicating average =
32k writes).

The 100 IOPS is a weird number here. Especially as at this time customer =
traffic
is impacted and apparently completely stalled. My impression from =
reading about
the writeback mechanisms and your description of journal flushes was =
that=20
none of the flushing operations should cause a full stall until the =
caches or
journal is empty, but allow traffic to trickle, roughly at the backing =
storage
speed. Of course, if the system adds more traffic then is being written =
out
then it would still starve.

(I=E2=80=99m guessing that the journal flush doesn=E2=80=99t go through =
the writeback cache.
So maybe the journal isn=E2=80=99t really involved here at all.)

So, could it be that there is some (faulty) relationship with the cgroup
throttling interacting with the writeback and/or journal flush that =
causes=20
a) the available IOPS from the backing storage not being properly used =
and
b) other traffic being stalled that shouldn=E2=80=99t be?

How would I go about proving that?

I tried again to replicate the worst case traffic patterns and ran=20

fio --rw=3Drandwrite --name=3Dsynctest --bs=3D512 --direct=3D1 =
--numjobs=3D1 --ioengine=3Dlibaio --iodepth=3D8 --runtime=3D600 =
--fdatasync=3D8 --size=3D10m

which gave me consistent ~250 IOPS and finished in around 80 seconds.=20

I=E2=80=99m going to try to find a machine that exhibits the issues most =
often
and will a) apply lower bounds for the writeback cache, b) remove the
cgroup limits and c) both.

Thanks again,
Christian
