I remember seeing something similar to that one day we were talking about it,
and you showed me a script you wrote, many moons ago, probably the same source
where you got it from.

I actually explicitly mentioned stgit, because I know you use it, so I initially
intended to implement the feature on stgit too, as I thought you might see use
for it, but I gave up when I realized stgit can't import it to the stack only,
at least not without hacking up the script as you mentioned above.

Btw, is this a RwB? :)

I'd wait for Dave's review too, as I think he uses guilt too.
