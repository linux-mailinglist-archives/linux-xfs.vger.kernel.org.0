Seems reasonable.

"then reclaim"

Ignoring the typo, the comment doesn't add anything useful - you're
saying what the function does, not why. I'd prefer you lift all the
comments in the code up into the header, explaining why each step
is needed/taken. Something like:

/*
 * Flush and reclaim dirty inodes in preparation for unmount. Inodes and
 * internal inode structures can be sitting in the CIL and AIL at this point, so
 * we need to unpin them, write them back and/or reclaim them before unmount can
 * proceed.
 *
 * An inode cluster that has been freed can have its buffer still pinned in
 * memory because the transaction is still sitting in a iclog. The stale inodes
 * on that buffer will be pinned to the buffer until the transaction hits the
 * disk and the callbacks run. Pushing the AIL will skip the stale inodes and
 * may never see the pinned buffer, so nothing will push out the iclog and unpin
 * the buffer.
 *
 * Hence we need to force the log to unpin everything first. However, log forces
 * don't wait for the discards they issue to complete, so we have to explicitly
 * wait for them to complete here as well.
 *
 * Then we can tell the world we are unmounting so that error handling knows
 * that the filesystem is going away and we should error out anything that we
 * have been retrying in the background.  This will prevent never-ending retries
 * in AIL pushing from hanging the unmount.
 *
 * Finally, we can push the AIL to clean all the remaining dirty objects, then
 * reclaim the remaining inodes that are still in memory at this point in
 * time.

static void
xfs_unmount_flush_inodes(
	struct xfs_mount	*mp)
{
	xfs_log_force(mp, XFS_LOG_SYNC);
	xfs_extent_busy_wait_all(mp);
	flush_workqueue(xfs_discard_wq);

	mp->m_flags |= XFS_MOUNT_UNMOUNTING;

	xfs_ail_push_all_sync(mp->m_ail);
	cancel_delayed_work_sync(&mp->m_reclaim_work);
	xfs_reclaim_inodes(mp);
	xfs_health_unmount(mp);
}

Everything else looks fine.

Cheers,

Dave.
