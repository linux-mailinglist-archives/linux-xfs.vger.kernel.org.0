It handles them the same as every other buffer, which is to say that I
think we've found another recovery zeroday.

xlog_recover_buf_commit_pass2 reads the ondisk buffer, and then calls
xlog_recover_get_buf_lsn to fish the LSN out of the ondisk buffer.  That
second function doesn't corroborate the ondisk magic with the XFS_BLFT_*
flags recovered from the buffer item, so if the log item was for an rt
bitmap block and the user controls the rt layout as I describe above,
they can totally screw up log recovery.

Only after we return a garbage LSN do we call xlog_recover_do_reg_buffer
-> xlog_recover_validate_buf_type and look at the buf_f flags to attach
verifier ops, but by then it's too late to undo the damage.

I think the answer is to combine the two functions so that we check the
BLFT and the ondisk magic.  If they match, we can set b_ops and return
the ondisk LSN and then decide if we're really going to replay the bli
contents.  If they don't match, I guess we recover the whole bli?  Or
abort?  I'll try to get to that after $meetings.
