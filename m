Well, I'm not suggesting that we have to fix all of them at once.
Just converting this specific one to a IGEO variable is probably
only 20 lines of code, which is still an "easy to backport" fix.

i.e. XFS_IALLOC_SPACE_RES() is used in just 7 places in the code,
4 of them are in that same header file, so it's a simple, standalone
patch that fixes the bug by addressing the underlying cause of
the problem (i.e. nasty macro!).

Historically speaking , we have cleaned up stuff like this to fix
the bug, not done a one liner and then left fixing the root cause to
some larger chunk of future work. The "one-liner" approach is
largely a recent invention. I look at this sort of thing as being
similar to cleaning up typedefs: we remove typedefs as we change
surrounding code, thereby slowly remove them over time. We could
just remove them all as one big patchset, but we don't do that
because of all the outstanding work it would cause conflicts in.

Perhaps we've lost sight of the fact that doing things in little
chunks on demand actually results in a lot of good cleanup change
over time. We really don't have to do cleanups as one huge chunk of
work all at once....

Cheers,

Dave.
