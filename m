We've got to keep the existing whiteout method around for,
essentially, forever, because we have to support kernels that don't
do in-memory translations of DT_WHT to a magic chardev inode and
vice versa (i.e. via mknod). IOWs, we'll need a feature bit to
indicate that we actually have DT_WHT based whiteouts on disk.

So we may as well fix this properly now by restructuring the code as
we will still have to maintain this functionality for a long time to
come.

Cheers,

Dave.
