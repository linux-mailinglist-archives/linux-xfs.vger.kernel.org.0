It's an internal abstraction to allow code to be shared easily with
the kernel and between xfsprogs binaries. It is not a library in the
sense it has a fixed API and ABI that compatibility has to be
maintained across releases (i.e. like, say, libhandle). It is a
library in the sense is contains shared code that things within the
build don't have to re-implement them over and over again, and
because it is internal that means the rules for external/distro
level libraries don't need to be strictly applied.

e.g. if -everything- uses a global variable and has to declares it
themselves so the shared internal code can access it, then why not
just declare it in the shared code? :)

You mean structure the unmount code like we do in teh kernel? e.g:

You mean like this code that I'm slowly working on to bring the
xfs_buf.c code across to userspace and get rid of the heap of crap
we have in libxfs/{rdwr,cache}.c now and be able to use AIO properly
and do non-synchronous delayed writes like we do in the kernel?

libxfs/init.c:
....
static void
buftarg_cleanup(
        struct xfs_buftarg      *btp)
{
        if (!btp)
                return;

        while (btp->bt_lru.l_count > 0)
                xfs_buftarg_shrink(btp, 1000);
        xfs_buftarg_wait(btp);
        xfs_buftarg_free(btp);
}

/*
 * Release any resource obtained during a mount.
 */
void
libxfs_umount(
        struct xfs_mount        *mp)
{
        struct xfs_perag        *pag;
        int                     agno;

        libxfs_rtmount_destroy(mp);

        buftarg_cleanup(mp->m_ddev_targp);
        buftarg_cleanup(mp->m_rtdev_targp);
        if (mp->m_logdev_targp != mp->m_ddev_targp)
                buftarg_cleanup(mp->m_logdev_targp);
.....

libxfs/xfs_buftarg.c:
.....
void
xfs_buftarg_free(
        struct xfs_buftarg      *btp)
{
        ASSERT(percpu_counter_sum(&btp->bt_io_count) == 0);
        percpu_counter_destroy(&btp->bt_io_count);
        platform_flush_device(btp->bt_fd, btp->bt_bdev);
	libxfs_device_close(btp->bt_bdev);
        free(btp);
}

I haven't added the error returns for this code yet - I'm still
doing the conversion and making it work.

I'll probably have to throw the vast majority of that patchset away
and start again if all this API change that darrick has done is
merged. And that will probably involve me throwing away all of the
changes in this patch series because they just don't make any sense
once the code is restructured properly....

Cheers,

Dave.
