Agree on all this..

... but it seems a bit of a leap to equate exploitation of a
historically poorly handled allocation pattern in developer tests with
adding a new requirement (i.e. sync) to achieve optimal behavior of a
fairly common allocation pattern (delete a file, use the space for
something else).

IOW, how to hack around test regressions aside (are the test regressions
actual ENOSPC failures or something else, btw?), what's the impact on
users/workloads that might operate under these conditions? I guess
historically we've always recommended to not consistently operate in
<20% free space conditions, so to some degree there is an expectation
for less than optimal behavior if one decides to constantly bash an fs
into ENOSPC. Then again with large enough files, will/can we put the
filesystem into that state ourselves without any indication to the user?

I kind of wonder if unless/until there's some kind of efficient feedback
between allocation and "pending" free space, whether deferred
inactivation should be an optimization tied to some kind of heuristic
that balances the amount of currently available free space against
pending free space (but I've not combed through the code enough to grok
whether this already does something like that).
