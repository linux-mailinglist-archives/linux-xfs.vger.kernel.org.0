So this looks like last_sync_lsn is 2/19330, and the transaction
reservation is ~380kB, or close on 3% of the log. The reserve grant
head is at 3/18580, so we're ~700 * 512 = ~350kB of reservation
remaining. Yup, so we are definitely in the "go to sleep and wait"
situation here.

200ms later the tail has moved, and last_sync_lsn is now 3/18501.
i.e. the iclog writes have made it to disk, and the items have been
moved into the AIL. I don't know where that came from, but I'm
assuming it's an IO completion based on it being run from a
kworker context that doesn't have an "xfs-" name prefix(*).

As the tail has moved, this should have woken the anything sleeping
on the log tail in xlog_grant_head_wait() via a call to
xfs_log_space_wake(). The first waiter should wake, see that there
still isn't room in the log (only 3 sectors were freed in the log,
we need at least 60). That woken process should then run
xlog_grant_push_ail() again and go back to sleep.

(*) I have a patch that shortens "s/kworker/kw/" so that you can
actually see the name of the kworker in the 16 byte field we have
for the task name. We really should just increase current->comm to
32 bytes.

Ans some 40s later the xfsaild is woken by something, sees there's
nothing to do, and goes back to sleep. I don't see the process
sleeping on the grant head being ever being woken and calling
xlog_grant_push_ail(), which would see the new last_sync_lsn and
move the push target....

From this trace, it looks like the problem here is a missing or
incorrectly processed wakeup when the log tail moves.

Unfortunately, you haven't used the built in trace points for
debugging log space hangs so I can't tell anything more than this.
i.e the trace we need contains these build in tracepoints:

# trace-cmd record -e xfs_log\* -e xfs_ail\* sleep 120 &
# <run workload that hangs within 120s>

<wait for trace-cmd to exit>
# trace-cmd report | gzip > trace.txt.gz

as that will record all transaction reservations, grant head
manipulations, changes to the tail lsn, when processes sleep on the
grant head and are worken, AIL insert/move/delete, etc.

This will generate a -lot- of data. I often generate and analyse
traces in the order of tens of GBs of events to track down issues
like this, because the problem is often only seen in a single trace
event in amongst the millions that are recorded....

And if we need more info, then we add the appropriate tracepoints
into xlog_grant_push_ail, xfsaild_push, etc under those tracepoint
namespaces, so next time we have a problem we don't ahve to write
custom tracepoints.....

The default minimum size.

Likely because now the 380k transaction reservation is only 2% of the
log instead of close to 4% of the log, and so the overrun isn't
large enough to trigger whatever wakeup issue we have....

Can you get a complete trace (as per above) of a hang? we're going
to need that trace to validate any analysis you do yourself,
anyway...
