<nod> I'm running an experiment overnight with the following patch to
get rid of the session id grossness.  AFAICT it can also be used by
check-parallel to start its subprocesses in separate pid namespaces,
though I didn't investigate thoroughly.

I'm also not sure it's required for check-helper to unmount the /proc
that it creates; merely exiting seems to clean everything up? <shrug>

I also tried using systemd-nspawn to run fstests inside a "container"
but very quickly discovered that you can't pass block devices to the
container which makes fstests pretty useless for testing real scsi
devices. :/

check: run tests in a private pid/mount namespace

Experiment with running tests in a private pid/mount namespace for
better isolation of the scheduler (check) vs the test (./$seq).  This
also makes it cleaner to adjust the oom score and is a convenient place
to set up the environment before invoking the test.
