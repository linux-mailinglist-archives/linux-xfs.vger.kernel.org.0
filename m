Hmmm... OTOH I wonder how many people really run fsr?  Even I don't...

It happens semi-frequently with current upstream, and all the time with
the atomic file swap series.

It's related, but only in the sense that the "zomg hundreds of thousands
of intents sitting around in memory" were a side effect of creating a
test that creates two files with ~50000 extents and fsr'ing them.
