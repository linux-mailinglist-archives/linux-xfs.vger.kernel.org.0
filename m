Hm, I'm not that familiar with udev or what it logs, so I can't really say
offhand. If you know for sure that this mapping is possible to achieve in
other ways, that may be useful.

I guess I'm still of the opinion that having the device::uuid mapping clearly
stated at mount time in the kernel logs is useful, though; AFAIK there is no
real "cost" to this, and other subsystems already print UUIDs for various
reasons so it's not an unusual thing to do.

(I'd have hesitated to add yet another printk for this purpose, but extending
an existing printk seems completely harmless...)
