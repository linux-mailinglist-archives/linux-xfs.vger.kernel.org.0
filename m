Yup I failed to edit it properly and left an extra "result" in the
sentence...

In reading this again, it is all a bit clunky. I've revised it a bit
more to more concisely describe the situation:

	/*
	 * The is a chance that the size of the CIL checkpoints in
	 * progress at the last AIL push target calculation resulted in
	 * limiting the target to the log head (l_last_sync_lsn) at the
	 * time. This may not reflect where the log head is now as the
	 * CIL checkpoints may have completed.
	 *
	 * Hence when we are woken here, it may be that the head of the
	 * log that has moved rather than the tail. As the tail didn't
	 * move, there still won't be space available for the
	 * reservation we require.  However, if the AIL has already
	 * pushed to the target defined by the old log head location, we
	 * will hang here waiting for something else to update the AIL
	 * push target.
	 *
	 * Therefore, if there isn't space to wake the first waiter on
	 * the grant head, we need to push the AIL again to ensure the
	 * target reflects both the current log tail and log head
	 * position before we wait for the tail to move again.
	 */

Cheers,

Dave.
