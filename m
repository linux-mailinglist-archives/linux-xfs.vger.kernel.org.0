More of a process thought than an issue with this particular patch, but
I feel like the Fixes tag thing gets more watered down as we attempt to
apply it to more patches. Is it really necessary here? If so, what's the
reasoning? I thought it was more of a "this previous patch has a bug,"
but that link seems a bit tenuous here given the original patch refers
specifically to wsync. Sure, a stable kernel probably wants both
patches, but is that really the primary purpose of "Fixes?"
