Subject: [PATCH 1/3] xfs: skip dquot reservations if quota is inactive
Date:   Thu,  1 Oct 2020 11:03:08 -0400

The dquot reservation helper currently performs the associated
reservation for any provided dquots. The dquots could have been
acquired from inode references or explicit dquot allocation
requests. Some reservation callers may have already checked that the
associated quota subsystem is active (xfs_qm_dqget() returns an
error otherwise), while others might not have checked at all
(xfs_trans_reserve_quota_nblks() passes the inode references).
Further, subsequent dquot modifications do actually check that the
associated quota is active before making transactional changes
(xfs_trans_mod_dquot_byino()).

Given all of that, the behavior to unconditionally perform
reservation on any provided dquots is somewhat ad hoc. While it is
currently harmless, it is not without side effect. If the quota is
inactive by the time a transaction attempts a quota reservation, the
dquot will be attached to the transaction and subsequently logged,
even though no dquot modifications are ultimately made.

This is a problem for upcoming quotaoff changes that intend to
implement a strict transactional barrier for logging dquots during a
quotaoff operation. If a dquot is logged after the subsystem
deactivated and the barrier released, a subsequent log recovery can
incorrectly replay dquot changes into the filesystem.

Therefore, update the dquot reservation path to also check that a
particular quota mode is active before associating a dquot with a
transaction. This should have no noticeable impact on the current
code that already accommodates checking active quota state at points
before and after quota reservations are made.
