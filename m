Yes, it does, however, the reason I don't have a fix for that ready is
that...

...rejecting a directory unlink with EDQUOT creates the situation where
a user who's gone over the soft limit cannot rm a file to get themselves
back under quota because the removal asked for enough bmbt-expansion
quota reservation to push the quota over the hard limit...

...and while the next thing that occurred to me was to retry the quota
reservation with FORCE_RES, having such a path means that one can still
overrun the hard limit (albeit slowly) by creating a fragmented
directory and selectively removing entries to cause bmbt splits.

I /think/ I'm ok with the "retry with FORCE_QUOTA" solution for
xfs_remove, but I'm hanging onto it for now for further consideration
and QA testing.

They're not the same problem -- adding hardlinks is not a known strategy
for reducing quota usage below the limits, whereas unlinking files is.

I sent a patch for the link situation because I thought it looked like
an obvious fix, and left the unlink() problem until a full solution is
presented or proved impossible.

Yes, I know about that problem.  I've *solved* that problem with the
atomic extent swap rewrite that's been hanging out in djwong-dev since
late 2019 as part of the online fsck series.  Perhaps I will have time
to send that in late 2022.
