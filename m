It takes a lot more to get me frustrated :)

And I am _VERY_ supprised to hear you have not heard anything about this
given that Oracle has some lawyers who have been very involved in the
SPDX process.  One would have thought they had discussed it with their
developers.  They sure seem to come to me with questions that start,
"Our developers had a question about...", so I know they must talk to
someone...

Thomas seems to have answered all of your questions, hopefully.

And yeah, Thomas and I should probably be listed in MAINTAINERS for
LICENSES as we somehow got tagged for all of this work.
