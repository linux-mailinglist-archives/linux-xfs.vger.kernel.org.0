Heh.. well you've already done the hard part. ;) If you already have a
local commit in a git tree, just write up a proper commit log based on
what you've described above (no need to include the "proof," I think),
make sure there's a Signed-off-by: tag and 'git format-patch ..' / 'git
send-email' to the list.

If you want to be sure everything is formatted correctly, it can be
useful to mail the patch to yourself and verify that you can save it and
apply it locally to a clean branch before sending to the list.
