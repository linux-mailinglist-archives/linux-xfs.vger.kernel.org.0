Entirely possible the logic isn't correct ;)

IIRC, I added this because I thought that blen ends up influencing
args->maxlen and nothing else. The alignment isn't taken out of
"blen", it's supposed to be added to args->maxlen.

Ah, so you've hit the corner case of the largest free space being
exactly 80 in length and args->maxlen = 80.

So there's nothing wrong here. We've asked for any extent that
is between 76 and 80 blocks in length to be allocated, and we found
one that is 79 blocks in length.

Finding a 79 block extent instead of an 80 block extent like blen
indicated means that there was either:

- a block moved to the AGFL from that 80 block free extent prior to
  doing the free extent search.
- a block was busy and so was trimmed out via
  xfs_alloc_compute_aligned()
- the front edge wasn't aligned so it took a block off the front of
  the free space to align it. It's this condition that code I added
  above takes into account - an exact match on size does not imply
  that aligned allocation of exactly that size can be done.

Given the front edge is aligned, I'd say it was the latter that
occurred. The question is this: why wasn't the tail edge aligned
down to make the extent length 76 blocks?

> Removing the specific change to modify blen seems to make things ok again.

Right, because now the allocation ends up being set up with
args->minlen = args->maxlen = 80 and the allocation is unable to
align the extent and meet the args->minlen requirement from that
same unaligned 80 block free space. Hence that allocation fails and
we fall back to a different allocation strategy that searches other
AGs for a matching aligned allocation.

IOWs, removing the 'blen -= args->alignment' code simply kicks the
problem down the road until all AGs run out of 80 block contiguous
extents.

This really smells like a tail alignment bug, not a problem with the
allocation setup. Returning an extent that is 76 blocks in length
fulfils the 4 block alignment requirement, so why did tail alignment
fail?

Yes, it should fix this up.

That seems OK, we're doing aligned allocation and this is an ENOSPC
corner case so the aligned allocation should get rounded down in
xfs_alloc_fix_len() or rejected.

One thought I just had is that the args->maxlen adjustment shouldn't
be to "available space" - it should probably be set to args->minlen
because that's the aligned 'alloc_len' we checked available space
against. That would fix this, because then we'd have args->minlen =
args->maxlen = 76.

However, that only addresses this specific case, not the general
case of xfs_alloc_fix_len() failing to tail align the allocated
extent.

> Then xfs_alloc_fix_len() allows

Yeah, that smells wrong.

I'd suggest that we've never noticed this until now because we
have never guaranteed extent alignment. Hence the occasional
short/unaligned extent being allocated in dark ENOSPC corners was
never an issue for anyone.

However, introducing a new alignment guarantee turns these sorts of
latent non-issues into bugs that need to be fixed. i.e. This is
exactly the sort of rare corner case behaviour I expected to be
flushed out by guaranteeing and then extensively testing allocation
alignments.

If you drop the rlen == args->maxlen check from
xfs_alloc_space_available(), the problem should go away and the
extent gets trimmed to 76 blocks. This shouldn't affect anything
else because maxlen allocations should already be properly aligned -
it's only when something like ENOSPC causes args->maxlen to be
modified to an unaligned value that this issue arises.

In the end, I suspect we'll want to make both changes....

> To me, that (args->alignment - 1) component in calculating alloc_len is odd.
> I assume it is done as default args->alignment == 1.

No, it's done because guaranteeing aligned allocation requires
selecting an aligned region from an unaligned free space. i.e.  when
alignment is 4, then we can need up to 3 additional blocks to
guarantee front alignment for a given length extent.
i.e. we have to over-allocate to guarantee we can trim up
to alignment at the front edge and still guarantee that the extent
is as long as required by args->minlen/maxlen.

Cheers,

Dave.
