Yup, most likely because we changed something in XFS related to
internal block reservation spaces. That is, the test is making
fundamentally flawed assumptions about filesystem used space
accounting.

It is wrong to assuming that the available capacity of a given empty
filesystem will never change.  Assumptions like this have been
invalid for decades because the available space can change based on
the underlying configuration or the filesystem. e.g. different
versions of mkfs.xfs set different default parameters and so simply
changing the version of xfsprogs you use between the two comparision
tests will make it fail....

And, well, XFS also has XFS_IOC_{GS}ET_RESBLKS ioctls that allow
userspace to change the amount of reserved blocks. They were
introduced in 1997, and since then we've changed the default
reservation the filesystem takes at least a dozen times.

Yup, any test that assumes "available space" does not change from
kernel version to kernel version is flawed. There is no guarantee
that this ever stays the same, nor that it needs to stay the same.

That warning is from mkfs attempting to use fallocate(ZERO_RANGE) to
offload the zeroing of the journal to the block device. It would
seem that the loop device image file is being hosted on a filesystem
that does not support the fallocate() ZERO_RANGE (or maybe
PUNCH_HOLE) operation. That warning should simply be removed - it
serves no useful purpose to a user...

CHeers,

Dave.
