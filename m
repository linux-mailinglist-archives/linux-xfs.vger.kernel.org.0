I suspect deadlocks on filesystems in the process of being frozen
when the log is full and relogging is required to make progress.

So this assumes you've stolen the log reservation for this ticket
from somewhere else, because otherwise the transaction log
reservation and the ticket don't match.

FWIW, I'm having trouble real keeping all the ail relog ticket
references straight. Code seems to be
arbitratily taking and dropping references to that ticket, and I
can't see a pattern or set of rules for usage.

Why does this specific transaction need a reference to the ticket,
when the ail_relog_list has a reference, every item that has been
marked as XFS_LI_RELOG already has a reference, etc?

I dislike the way the "swiss army knife" list macro makes this
code unreadable.

        while (!list_empty(&ailp->ail_relog_list)) {
		lip = list_first_entry(...)

is much neater and easier to read.

This seems completely arbitrary.

So the reservation for this ticket is going to be regranted over and
over again and space reserved repeatedly as we work through the
locked relog items one at a time?

Unfortunately, this violates the rule that prevents rolling
transactions from deadlocking. That is, any object that is held
locked across the transaction commit and regrant that *might pin the
tail of the log* must be relogged in the transaction to move the
item forward and prevent it from pinning the tail of the log.

IOWs, if one of the items later in the relog list pins the tail of
the log we will end up sleeping here:

  xfs_trans_roll()
    xfs_trans_reserve
      xfs_log_regrant
        xlog_grant_head_check(need_bytes)
	  xlog_grant_head_wait()

waiting for the write grant head to move. ANd it never will, because
we hold the lock on that item so the AIL can't push it out.
IOWs, using a rolling transaction per relog item will not work for
processing multiple relog items.

If it's a single transaction, and we join all the locked items
for relogging into it in a single transaction commit, then we are
fine - we don't try to regrant log space while holding locked items
that could pin the tail of the log.

We *can* use a rolling transaction if we do this - the AIL has a
permenant transaction (plus ticket!) allocated at mount time with
a log count of zero, we can then steal reserve/write grant head
space into it that ticket at CIL commit time as I mentioned
previously. We do a loop like above, but it's basically:

{
	LIST_HEAD(tmp);

	spin_lock(&ailp->ail_lock);
        if (list_empty(&ailp->ail_relog_list)) {
		spin_unlock(&ailp->ail_lock);
		return;
	}

	list_splice_init(&ilp->ail_relog_list, &tmp);
	spin_unlock(&ailp->ail_lock);

	xfs_ail_relog_items(ail, &tmp);
}

This allows the AIL to keep working and building up a new relog
as it goes along. hence we can work on our list without interruption
or needed to repeatedly take the AIL lock just to get items from the
list.

And xfs_ail_relog_items() does something like this:

{
	struct xfs_trans	*tp;

	/*
	 * Make CIL committers trying to change relog status of log
	 * items wait for us to istabilise the relog transaction
	 * again by committing the current relog list and rolling
	 * the transaction.
	 */
	down_write(&ail->ail_relog_lock);
	tp = ail->relog_trans;

	while ((lip = list_first_entry_or_null(&ailp->ail_relog_list,
					       struct xfs_log_item,
					       li_trans)) != NULL) {
        while (!list_empty(&ailp->ail_relog_list)) {
		lip = list_first_entry(&ailp->ail_relog_list,
					struct xfs_log_item, li_trans);
		list_del_init(&lip->li_trans);

		xfs_trans_add_item(tp, lip);
		set_bit(XFS_LI_DIRTY, &lip->li_flags);
		tp->t_flags |= XFS_TRANS_DIRTY;
	}

	error = xfs_trans_roll(&tp);
	if (error) {
		SHUTDOWN!
	}
	ail->relog_trans = tp;
	up_write(&ail->ail_relog_lock);
}

So the XFS_LI_RELOGGED bit indicates that the item is locked on the
relog list? That means nothing else in the transaction subsystem
will set that until the item is unlocked, right? Which is when it
ends up back on the CIL. This then gets cleared by the CIL being
forced and the item moved forward in the AIL.

IOWs, a log force clears this flag until the AIL relogs it again.
Why do we need this flag to issue wakeups when the wait loop does
blocking log forces? i.e. it will have already waited for the flag
to be cleared by waiting for the log force....

Cheers,

Dave.
