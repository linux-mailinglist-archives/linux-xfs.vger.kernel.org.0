This is similar to the exchange we had last March:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20220324104521.GF12805@kadam/

wherein there was a series of if tests that would bail out early on
error, followed by one last test that checks if we've no further work to
do and returns a zero that was set earlier in the function.  This sort
of situation is probably very difficult to detect within a static
checker, but I would much prefer that we review the online fsck
patchset[1] instead of reopening review on existing code that already
works and has already been merged.
