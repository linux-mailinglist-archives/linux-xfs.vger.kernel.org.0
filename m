Ok, I see. The "proper" way to get rid of the warning requires too much
effort, so there are doubts as to whether it is worth it.

Ok, I get it, but what bothers me is why I only see this message on one
system and not the other.

At first I thought it had to do with the fact that I explicitly set
"read-only" attribute (chattr +i) to one file (/etc/resolv.conf), but I
checked that both systems had the same settings on that file. Then I thought
it might be a problem with XFS, but I configured to run fsck on every boot,=
 so
that the problem would be revealed at boot time, and I wouldn't see it again
after the next reboot. But the message remains even after reboot. So I must
conclude that the warning has nothing to do with the FS and the problem lies
somewhere else.

I'm puzzled why I don't see this message on the second system, especially
since I didn't see it with kernel 5.15 and the previous linux-next (I have a
different problem with these systems, so I don't run kernels 6.0+, but I'm
running linux-next to see if the problem persists). Let me stress what worr=
ies
me: why am I seeing this message on one system and not on the other? Why I
didn't see this message on the previous linux-next (compiled with the same
compiler)?

It might be related to the disks used (HDD, SSD SATA and NVME), because on =
the
system in question systemd gives a warning like 'invalid GPT table' (or
something like that, not the exact wording), even when I have repartitioned
the disk.
