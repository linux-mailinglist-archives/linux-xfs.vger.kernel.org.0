This was one of the things I wondered about on an earlier versions of
this work; whether we wanted to shrink to be deliberately incremental or
not. I suspect that somewhat applies to even this version without AG
truncation because technically we could allocate as much as possible out
of end of the last AG and shrink by that amount. My initial thought was
that if the implementation is going to be opportunistic (i.e., we
provide no help to actually free up targeted space), perhaps an
incremental implementation is a useful means to allow the operation to
make progress. E.g., run a shrink, observe it didn't fully complete,
shuffle around some files, repeat, etc. 

IIRC, one of the downsides of that sort of approach is any use case
where the goal is an underlying storage device resize. I suppose an
underlying device resize could also be opportunistic, but it seems more
likely to me that use case would prefer an all or nothing approach,
particularly if associated userspace tools don't really know how to
handle a partially successful fs shrink. Do we have any idea how other
tools/fs' behave in this regard (I thought ext4 supported shrink)? FWIW,
it also seems potentially annoying to ask for a largish shrink only for
the tool to hand back something relatively tiny.

Based on your design description, it occurs to me that perhaps the ideal
outcome is an implementation that supports a fully atomic all-or-nothing
shrink (assuming this is reasonably possible), but supports an optional
incremental mode specified by the interface. IOW, if we have the ability
to perform all-or-nothing, then it _seems_ like a minor interface
enhancement to support incremental on top of that as opposed to the
other way around. Therefore, perhaps that should be the initial goal
until shown to be too complex or otherwise problematic..?
