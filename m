Got it.

Yeah, it might be clearer overall to not intertwine the fields.

Ok, so the dabtree portion doesn't properly account for dabtree splits
and cannot do so as part of a mount time calculation.

Ok.

Hm, Ok. I think I follow, though I'm still curious if this was a
reproducible problem or not.

Can we further break down some of these changes into smaller patches
that either fix one issue or do some refactoring? For example, one patch
could move the existing rt reservation out of ->tr_attrsetrt (removing
it) and establish the new xfs_calc_attr_res() function without changing
the reservation. Another patch could move the dabtree component from the
mount time to the runtime calculation. It's not clear to me if the
individual components of the new rt calculation can be further broken
down from there without risk of transient regression, but it seems we
should at least be able to rework the reservation calculation in a
single patch that does so from first principles with the necessary
refactoring work to accommodate the proper mount/run time components
already done..
