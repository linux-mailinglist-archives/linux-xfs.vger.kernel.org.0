No problem.. if it's useful it's good to have a record of out around
somewhere until the end result is more stabilized and we can determine
whether this warrants a permanent home somewhere in the code.

Hmm.. I could just be missing something or not far along enough in the
series. Can you point me at an example of where we need to finish/roll
before the caller of xfs_attr_remove_args() commits the transaction?

AFAICT every codepath after this assigns error one way or another before
it's returned. There's another error =3D 0 assignment just before the out=
:
label.

Ah, Ok. Normally I'd say document things like this in the commit log so
we don't lose track, though I don't know how much space we have there.

Ok, I might have just not got there yet.

I do think the refactoring should be done first. This does make it more
challenging for the developer (IMO) because I know I'd probably have to
hack around with the state bits to have a better idea of how to refactor
things in some cases, and then go back and retrofit the refactoring.

The advantage is that the heavy lifting in this series becomes agnostic
to the state bits. Refactoring patches are easier to review and we can
make progress because there's less of a need to carry those out of tree
through however many versions of the state code we'll need before
getting it merged. Once the code is sufficiently factored, the state
code should be much simpler to introduce and review since we hopefully
won't be jumping around into the middle of functions, multiple branches
of logic deep, etc.

(I see Dave commented similarly on a couple of the subsequent patches. I
100% agree with the approach he describes there and that is similar to
what I was trying to describe with the diff I attached in my earlier
mail...)
