What's the point of fixing it twice when the generic code already
exports the appropriate helpers? filemap_fdatawrite() and
filemap_fdatawait_keep_errors() are used fairly commonly afaict. That
seems much more straightforward to me than misusing a convenience helper
and trying to undo the undesirable effects after the fact.

The context for the above is not clear to me. If the purpose is to check
on-disk metadata, shouldn't we flush the in-core content first? It would seem
a little strange to me for one file check to behave differently from
another if the only difference between the two is that some or more of a
file had been written back, but maybe I'm missing details..
