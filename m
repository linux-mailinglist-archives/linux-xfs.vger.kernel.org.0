Can I add:

and can I change this (and other mkfs option notes) to:

+ This option is only tunable on the deprecated V4 format.

because we actually do accept i.e. "-i attr=2" on a V5 format today.

so, "you can't tune it on v5, and it goes away when v4 does" seems to
capture what you want the user to know.

I think you're restated it here in the same section; I can just drop this extra
one if you concur.
