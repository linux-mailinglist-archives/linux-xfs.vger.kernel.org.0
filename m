Actually one thing I have on my TODO list is to move the log item type
specific recovery code first into an ops vector, and then out to the
xfs_*_item.c together with the code creating those items.  That isn't
really all of the recovery code, but it seems like a useful split.

Note that the I/O code isn't really very log specific, it basically
just is trivial I/O to a vmalloc buffer code.  In fact I wonder if
I could just generalize it a little more and move it to the block layer.

Given that we:

 a) do direct I/O everywhere
 b) tend to do it on either a block device, or a file where we don't
    need to allocate over holes

aio should be a win everywhere.  The only caveat is that CONFG_AIO
is kernel option and could be turned off in some low end configs.
