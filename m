I've added that back.  For real this time.

I (almost) always make the changes to my local tree even if you say
you'll do it on the way in, because that makes it easier to compare the
for-next tree vs. my about-to-be-rebased dev tree.

Unfortunately, I do occasionally slip up and forget to make the changes,
even if I've sent email assenting to the changes, because there's not
anything linking "I will make this change" in the email thread to
actually scribbling in the git tree.

Add to that the fact that email clients don't maintain spatial locality
between v3->v4->v5 of a patchset and that just makes it more difficult
to stay on top of reviews as a developer, because I can't even
self-check without having to scroll through hundreds of emails.

So yeah, I guess I'll go review my reviews...  sorry for the crap.
