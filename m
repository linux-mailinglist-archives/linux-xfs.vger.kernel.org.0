I think the code is flaky, but I'm not sure why that's unreasonable. The
intent of args.total is to be larger than the mapping length.

Maybe..? There is no requirement that the additional blocks accounted by
args.total be contiguous with the allocation for the mapping, so I don't
see how you could reliably predict that.
