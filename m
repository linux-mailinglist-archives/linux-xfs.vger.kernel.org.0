I chose to stuff the excess blocks into the bnobt and cntbt bulkload
cursors to avoid having to initialize a semi-phony "bulkload cursor" for
the agfl, and I decided to split them evenly between the two cursors so
that I wouldn't have someday to deal with a bug report about how one
cursor somehow ran out of blocks but the other one had plenty more.

Hmm.  I hadn't thought about that.  In general I wanted the AGFL
reservations to go last because I'd rather we set off with an underfull
AGFL than totally fail because we couldn't get blocks for the
bnobt/cntbt, but I suppose you're right that we could steal from it as
needed to prevent repair failure.

So, uh, I could rework this patch to create a phony agfl bulk load
cursor, fill it before the loop, steal blocks from it to fill the
bnobt/cntbt to satisfy failed allocations, and then dump any remainders
into the bnobt/cntbt cursors afterwards.  How does that sound?
