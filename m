Hi all,

While I was taking a closer look at Chandan's earlier fixes for the
realtime growfs code, I realized that fstests doesn't actually have a
test case for growing a realtime volume.  I wrote one for testing rmap
expansions on the data device and kludged it to work for realtime, and
watched the kernel trip over a ton of assertions and fail xfs_scrub.

The two patches in this series fix the two problems that I found.  The
first is that inode inactivation will truncate the new bitmap blocks if
we don't set the VFS inode size; and the second is that we don't update
the secondary superblocks with the new rt geometry.

I'll cough up a test case after this patch.

If you're going to start using this mess, you probably ought to just
pull from my git trees, which are linked below.

This is an extraordinary way to destroy everything.  Enjoy!
Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
