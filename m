Oh good, because FSTRIM is dog slow even when you don't have other
threads impatiently waiting on the AGF. :)

IOWs I don't have to wade through six patches of code golf just to
figure out what this does.  Much easier to review, thank you.

...and if the cntbt search encounters a busy extent, it'll skip it.  I
think that means that two FITRIM invocations running in lockstep can
miss the extents being discarded by the other, right?

I think this can happen with your patch?

T0:				T1:
xfs_alloc_read_agf
walk cntbt,
    add free space to busy list
relse agf
issue discards

				xfs_alloc_read_agf
...still waiting...
				walk cntbt,
				    see all free space on busy list
				relse agf
...still waiting...
				"done" (despite discard in progress)

...still waiting...
io completion
done

Whereas currently I think T1 will stubbornly wait for the AGF and then
re-discard everything again.  I wonder, should FITRIM call
xfs_extent_busy_flush if it finds already-busy extents?

Can we rearrange that "Similar to bulkstat's inode batching behavior, we
can minimise the AGF lock holdoffs [hold times?] whilst safely issuing
discards."

My hot take on that sentence was "bulkstat doesn't do discards" :)

What is this @longest value?  Is that a cursor for however far we've
walked through the cntbt?

Aha, it /is/ a cursor for the cntbt walk.  In that case, why not pass
around a xfs_alloc_rec_incore_t as the cursor, since cntbt lookups are
capable of searching by blockcount and startblock?

Then you'd initialize it with

struct xfs_alloc_rec_incore tcur = {
	.ar_blockcount = pag->pagf_longest;
};

and the XXX above turns into:

if (!tcur->ar_startblock)
	error = xfs_alloc_lookup_ge(cur, 0, tcur->ar_blockcount, &i);
else
	error = xfs_alloc_lookup_lt(cur, tcur->ar_startblock,
			tcur->ar_blockcount, &i);

Hmm.  So if the cntbt records are:

[N1, 100000]
[N2, 1]
[N3, 1]
...
[N100001, 1]

Does that mean batch 1 is:

[N1, 100000]

and batch 2 is:

<100,000 single block extents>

(where presumably N1..N100001 do not overlap)?

That seems poorly balanced, especially for (bad) SSDs whose per-discard
runtime is y = mx + b with a small m and huge b.

(Yes I have an SSD like that...)

I think if you changed the cursor to a cntbt record, then you could
bound the batch size by number of blocks, or number of busy extents,
or both, right?
