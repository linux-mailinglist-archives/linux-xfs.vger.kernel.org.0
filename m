From: Darrick J. Wong <darrick.wong@oracle.com>

Dave and I had a short discussion about whether or not xattr trees
needed to have the same free space tracking that directories have, and
a comparison of how each of the two metadata types interact with
dabtrees resulted.  I've reworked this a bit to make it flow better as a
book chapter, so here we go.

v2: various fixes suggested by Dave; reflow the paragraphs about
directories to describe the relations between dabtree and dirents only once;
don't talk about an unnamed "we".

+== Key Differences Between Directories and Extended Attributes
+
+Though directories and extended attributes can take advantage of the same
+variable length record btree structures (i.e. the dabtree) to map name hashes
+to directory entry records (dirent records) or extended attribute records,
+there are major differences in the ways that each of those users embed the
+btree within the information that they are storing.  The directory dabtree leaf
+nodes contain mappings between a name hash and the location of a dirent record
+inside the directory entry segment.  Extended attributes, on the other hand,
+store attribute records directly in the leaf nodes of the dabtree.
+
+When XFS adds or removes an attribute record in any dabtree, it splits or
+merges leaf nodes of the tree based on where the name hash index determines a
+record needs to be inserted into or removed.  In the attribute dabtree, XFS
+splits or merges sparse leaf nodes of the dabtree as a side effect of inserting
+or removing attribute records.
+
+Directories, however, are subject to stricter constraints.  The userspace
+readdir/seekdir/telldir directory cookie API places a requirement on the
+directory structure that dirent record cookie cannot change for the life of the
+dirent record.  XFS uses the dirent record's logical offset into the directory
+data segment as the cookie, and hence the dirent record cannot change location.
+Therefore, XFS cannot store dirent records in the leaf nodes of the dabtree
+because the offset into the tree would change as other entries are inserted and
+removed.
+
+Dirent records are therefore stored within directory data blocks, all of which
+are mapped in the first directory segment.  The directory dabtree is mapped
+into the second directory segment.  Therefore, directory blocks require
+external free space tracking because they are not part of the dabtree itself.
+Because the dabtree only stores pointers to dirent records in the first data
+segment, there is no need to leave holes in the dabtree itself.  The dabtree
+splits or merges leaf nodes as required as pointers to the directory data
+segment are added or removed, and needs no free space tracking.
+
+When XFS adds a dirent record, it needs to find the best-fitting free space in
+the directory data segment to turn into the new record.  This requires a free
+space index for the directory data segment.  The free space index is held in
+the third directory segment.  Once XFS has used the free space index to find
+the block with that best free space, it modifies the directory data block and
+updates the dabtree to point the name hash at the new record.  When XFS removes
+dirent records, it leaves hole in the data segment so that the rest of the
+entries do not move, and removes the corresponding dabtree name hash mapping.
+
+Note that for small directories, XFS collapses the name hash mappings and
+the free space information into the directory data blocks to save space.
+
+In summary, the requirement for a free space map in the directory structure
+results from storing the dirent records externally to the dabtree.  Attribute
+records are stored directly in the dabtree leaf nodes of the dabtree (except
+for remote attribute values which can be anywhere in the attr fork address
+space) and do not need external free space tracking to determine where to best
+insert them.  As a result, extended attributes exhibit nearly perfect scaling
+until the computer runs out of memory.
