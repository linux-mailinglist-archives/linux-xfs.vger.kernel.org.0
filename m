It is a bit of a historic custom, but not really followed strictly.
I tend to think of trivial container_of and similar addressing inline
functions just as macros with a saner implementation, and so does a
big part of the kernel community.  Where exactly that border is is not
clear, though.  And in doubt I think avoiding too much churn in changing
things unless there is a clear benefit is a good idea.  So maybe we
would have picked a lower case name for XFS_IFORK_PTR when adding it
new, but i don't really see any benefit in changing it now.

The same is true for some of the other patches later in the series,
except for maybe XFS_IFORK_Q, which has been really grossly and
confusingly misnamed.
