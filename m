If you are in a fs context you own current->journal_info.  But you
also must make sure to not copy from and especially to user to not
recurse into another file system.  A per-thread field can't work any
other way.  So what ext4 is doing here is perfectly fine.  What XFS
did was to set current->journal_info and then cause page faults, which
is not ok.  I'm glad we fixed it.

Indeed.

So I'm still confused on why this new code keeps the inode around if an
error happend, but xchk_irele does not.  What is the benefit of keeping
the inode around here?  Why des it not apply to xchk_irele?

I also don't understand how d_mark_dontcache in
xfs_ioctl_setattr_prepare_dax is supposed to work.  It'll make the inode
go away quicker than without, but it can't force the inode by itself.

I'm also lot on the interaction of that with the scrub inodes due to
both above.  I'd still expect any scrub iget to set uncached for
a cache miss.  If we then need to keep the inode around in transaction
context we just keep it.  What is the benefit of playing racing
games with i_count to delay setting the dontcache flag until irele?
And why does the DAX mess matter for that?

Maybe I'm just thick and this is all obvious, but then it needs to
be documented in detailed comments.
