Yes, but we do exactly this when freeing a large fragmented directly
block. That is, we ask xfs_bunmapi to unmap a 64kB range regardless
of how many extents map that range.

IOWs, the limitation in extent count placed in
xfs_itruncate_extents() doesn't actually address the underlying
problem - it's just a band-aid that has been placed over the easy to
trigger transaction overrun symptom that has always been present in
the underlying extent freeing code.

My point exactly - the code has always had a mismatch between
reservations and what we can stuff into an EFI.  EFIs are unbound in
size, so having a fixed "4 extents per EFI" reservation limit has
never made any real sense given that unmaping a 64kB directory block
on a 1kb block size filesystem has a worst case of freeing 64
extents in a single transaction. As I said above, the limitations
placed on xfs_itruncate_extents is largely a hack because it doesn't
address other avenues to the same overruns...

This "4 extents per transaction" reservation makes even less sense
now that extents are freed by defer ops, not by the transaction that
unmaps them. We've completely decoupled extent freeing from the
higher level code that unmaps them, and so now the freeing
transactions are independent of the high level code that runs the
freeing operations.

IOWs, having a reservation big enough to free a single extent is all
we should need now as we can break the extent freeing up into
individual transactions and still have them complete atomically even
after a crash. That's where I'm trying to get to here, but it's
clear that I need to refine the code a bit further such that we only
allow individual EFIs to queue up and free multiple extents within
an AG to be freed in the same transaction....

FWIW, I suspect that the right thing to do here is make use of the
xfs_defer_finish_one() mechanism for relogging the remaining intents
in work list while it is processing that list. All we need is for
xfs_extent_free_finish_item() to return -EAGAIN instead of running
the free transaction, and we will log the completed EFDs and the
remaining EFIs to be run and roll the transaction.

Hence we can control exactly when we roll the extent freeing
transaction (e.g. when the next extent to free is in a different AG
to the one we've just been freeing extents in) and as a result we
can define a fixed transaction reservation for extent freeing that
works in every situation without having to care about arbitrary
"how many extents can we unmap without overrun" concerns.

That's the goal here - fixed, small reservation for extent freeing
that is decoupled from and independent of the number of extents that
need to be freed atomically by the high level operation...

Hence I think that a minor amount of rework will allow the EFI code
to log large numbers of extents to be freed whilst still processing
them within single AG free space tree modification reservation
bounds...

Cheers,

Dave.
