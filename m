I would split this into two separate patches. One to move to a perag
based locking strategy, another to change from head to tail
addition as they are largely independent algorithmic changes.

These paths should be documented in the commit message as well
as in code comments so the reviewer is aware of those code paths
and can verify that your assumptions about locking order are
correct.

Hmmm. Flattening the code also make the patch harder to follow as it
combines code movement/rearrangement with algorithmic changes.  We
try to separate out code movement/rearrangement into their own
patches so that the movement is easy to verify by itself.

Also, the helper functions help document the separation of the
unlinked list manipulations from the from setup and locking
requirements for the list manipulations, and this largely undoes all
that. I added these helpers because it completely untangled the mess
that was present before the RFC patchset I posted. THat is, I
couldn't easily modify the existing code because it interleaved
the locking, the backref hash manipulations and
the on-disk list manipulations in ways I found difficult to
understand and manage. Short, simple, clear functions are much
better than long, multiple operation functions...

i.e. this:

xfs_iunlink()
{

	get locks
	do list insert
	drop locks
}

Is better for understanding, maintenance and future modification
than:

xfs_iunlink()
{

	get perag
	lock perag
	look at tail of list
	if (empty) {
		unlock perag
		read/lock AGI
		lock perag
		look at tail of list
		if (empty)
			do head insert
			goto out
	}
	do tail insert
out:
	update inode/pag tails
	unlock
	drop perag
}

It's trivial for a reader to understand what the first version of
xfs_iunlink() is going to do without needing to understand the
intraccies of the locking strategies. However, it takes time and
effort to undestand exactly waht the second one is doing because
it's not clear where lock ends and list modifications start, nor
what the locking rules are for the different modifications that are
being made. Essentially, it goes back to the complex
locking-intertwined-with-modification-algorithm problem the current
TOT code has.

I'd much prefer to see something like this:

/*
 * Inode allocation in the O_TMPFILE path defines the AGI/unlinked
 * list lock order as being AGI->perag unlinked list lock. We are
 * inverting it here as the fast path tail addition does not need to
 * modify the AGI at all. Hence we only need the AGI lock if the
 * tail is empty, but if we fail to get it without blocking then we
 * need to fall back to the slower, correct lock order.
 */
xfs_iunlink_insert_lock()
{
	get perag;
	lock_perag();
	if (!tail empty)
		return;
	if (trylock AGI)
		return;

	/*
	 * Slow path, need to lock AGI first. Don't even bother
	 * rechecking tail pointers or trying to optimise for
	 * minimal AGI lock hold time as racing unlink list mods
	 * will all block on the perag lock once we take that. They
	 * will then hit the !tail empty fast path and not require
	 * the AGI lock at all.
	 */
	lock AGI
	lock_perag()
	return;
}

The non-AGI locking fast path is slightly different in the remove
case, so we'll have a slightly different helper function in that
case which checks where the inode being removed is in the list.

In both cases, though, the unlock should be the same:

xfs_iunlink_unlock()
{
	/* Does not unlock AGI, ever. commit does that. */
	unlock perag
	put perag
}

This keeps the list locking completely separate from the list
manipulations and allows us to document the locking constraints and
reasons for why it is or isn't optimised for specific conditions
without cluttering up the list manipulations code.

Cheers,

Dave.
