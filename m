That's a good question.  I was doing the minimum needed to fix a
callsite.  Ted's commit seems to have pushed an unconditional (and
unchecked) call from the VFS into the first line of the filesystem
implementation.

Anyway I'll change the patch to move the call to xfs_remount_ro and
report back.  (Or rather, I did that last night, so we'll see what the
CI system reports...)
