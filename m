Well it's not something I'd say we should necessarily support for every
feature. TBH, I wasn't expecting an upgrade mechanism for inobtcount in
the first place since I thought we didn't tend to do that for v5
filesystems. ISTM it's simple enough to support and perhaps that's good
enough reason to do so, but if we're going to move the "test burden"
line anyways it seems rather arbitrary to me to support one direction
and not the other when they are presumably of comparable complexity.
Just my .02 of course, and I don't feel strongly about whether we
support upgrade, downgrade, or neither...
