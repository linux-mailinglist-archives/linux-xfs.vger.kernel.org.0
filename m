The filestream perag state would get trashed by the realloc of the
perag array that growfs used to do. Hence the filestreams had to be
flushed before growfs could realloc the array so there was no state
that could be lost by a grow. The m_peraglock was needed to
serialise that. Moving to the current perag tree setup meant grow no
longer reallocated perag structures, so they didn't go away
transiently and lose state any more, hence none of the flushing or
perag locking was needed anymore.

Shrink is a different matter altogether. The shrink context is going
to have to flush the filestreams itself after it makes sure that new
filestreams can't be created in that AG.....

Cheers,

Dave.
