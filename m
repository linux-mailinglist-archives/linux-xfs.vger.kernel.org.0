Observation: yesterday I forced a 4kB file create workload
to use unwritten extents by setting an extent size hint. That caused
about 4,500 xfs-conv kworker threads to be spawned by the workload
which had 16 userspace processes creating files...

I expect that any sort of "create lots of small files" worklaod is
going to cause xfs-conv kworker explosions, so be prepared for users
to start reporting kworker explosions with this in place...

Cheers,

Dave.
