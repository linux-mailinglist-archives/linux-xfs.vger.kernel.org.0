It makes a whole lot of sense, but it seems you don't like the
structure :)

As stated in the commit log we now have one helper that sets a
_XBF_PAGES backing with pages and the map, and one helper to
tear it down.   I think it makes a whole lot of sense this way.

It is something we also do elsewhere in the kernel.  Another
alternative would be to do a NULL check on the page, or to just
pointlessly duplicate the freeing loop.

This is to clearly split code consolidatation from behavior changes.
I could move both earlier at the downside of adding a lot of new
code first that later gets removed.

As mentioned in the cover letter: the bulk allocation review is what
trigger this as it tripped me following various lose ends.  And as
usual I'd rather have that kind of change at the end where the
surrounding code makes sense, so the rebased version is now is patch 11
of this series.
