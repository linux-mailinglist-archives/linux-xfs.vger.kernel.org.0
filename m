Hmmm. I don't doubt that this fixes the symptom you are seeing, but
the way it is being fixed doesn't seem right to me at all.

We're rtying to populate the AGFL here, and the fact is that a
multi-block allocation is simply an optimisation to minimise the
number of extents we need to allocate to fill the AGFL. The extent
that gets allocated gets broken up into single blocks to be inserted
into the AGFL, so we don't actually need a continuguous extent to be
allocated here.

Hence, if the extent we find is busy when allocating for the AGFL,
we should just skip it and choose another extent. args->minlen is
set to zero for the allocation, so we can actually return any extent
that has a length <= args->maxlen. We know this is an AGFL
allocation because args->resv == XFS_AG_RESV_AGFL, so if we find a
busy extent that would require a log force to be able to use before
we can place it in the AGFL, we should just skip it entirely and
select another extent to allocate from.

Adding another two boolean conditionals to the already complex
extent selection for this specific case makes the code much harder
to follow and reason about. I'd much prefer that we just do
something like:

	if (busy && args->resv == XFS_AG_RESV_AGFL) {
		/*
		 * Extent might have just been freed in this
		 * transaction so we can't use it. Move to the next
		 * best extent candidate and try that instead.
		 */
		<increment/decrement and continue the search loop>
	}

IOWs, we should not be issuing a log force to flush busy extents if
we can't use the largest candidate free extent for the AGFL - we
should just keep searching until we find one we can use....

Cheers,

Dave.
