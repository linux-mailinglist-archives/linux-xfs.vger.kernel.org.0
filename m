<nod> Ok, how about an ATTR_ROOT xattr "xfs.self_healing" that can be
one of "none", "check", or "repair".  No xattr means "check".

Sysadmins can already do that via systemctl mask, as I pointed out in
the earlier thread.  I think between that and the xattr we're covered.

Sounds reasonable to me.
