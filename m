I'm just referring to the semantics/naming of the existing interface. I
suppose I could have used "a log force that doesn't wait on all
iclogbufs to hit the disk," but that doesn't quite roll off the tongue.

Ok, that's not quite what I was concerned about when you mentioned
waiting on the CIL to flush to disk. No matter, the important bit here
is the performance cost of including the extra blocking on log I/O (to
cycle iclogs back to active for reuse) in the throttle.

I'm curious about how noticeable this extra blocking would be because
it's one likely cause of the CIL pressure buildup in the first place. My
original tests reproduced huge CIL checkpoints purely based on one CIL
push being blocked behind the processing of another, the latter taking
relatively more time due to log I/O.

This is not to say there aren't other causes of excessively sized
checkpoints. Rather, if we're at a point where we've blocked
transactions on this new threshold, that means we've doubled the
background threshold in the time we've first triggered a background CIL
push and the push actually started. From that, it seems fairly likely
that we could replenish the CIL to the background threshold once
threads are unblocked but before the previous push completes.

The question is: can we get all the way to the blocking threshold before
that happens? That doesn't seem unrealistic to me, but it's hard to
reason about without having tested it. If so, I think it means we end up
blocking on completion of the first push to some degree anyways.

That sounds more involved than what I was thinking. My thought is that
this throttle is already not predictable or deterministic (i.e. we're
essentially waiting on a scheduler event) and so might not require the
extra complexity of a new waitqueue. It certainly could be the case that
blocking on the entire push is just too long in practice, but since this
is already based on empirical evidence and subject to unpredictability,
ISTM that testing is the only way to know for sure. For reference, I
hacked up something to reuse xlog_cil_push_now() for background pushing
and throttling that ends up removing 20 or so lines of code by the time
it's in place, but I haven't given it any testing.

That said, this is just an observation and an idea. I'm fine with the
proposed implementation with the other nits and whatnot fixed up.
