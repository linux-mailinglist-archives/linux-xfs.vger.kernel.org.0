Because we now take the ILOCK while still holding the i_flags_lock
instead of dropping the spin lock then trying to get the ILOCK.
Hence with this change, if we get the ILOCK we are guaranteed that
the inode number has not changed and don't need to recheck it.

This is guaranteed by xfs_reclaim_inode() because it locks in
the order of ILOCK -> i_flags_lock and it zeroes the ip->i_ino
while holding both these locks. Hence if we've got the i_flags_lock
and we try to get the ILOCK, the inode is either going to be valid and
reclaim will skip the inode (because we hold locks) or the inode
will already be in reclaim and the ip->i_ino will be zero....

Actually, because we hold the buffer lock. We only flush the inode
to the buffer when we are holding the buffer lock, so all flush
locking shold nest inside the buffer lock. So for taking the flock,
the lock order is bp->b_sema -> ILOCK_EXCL -> iflock. We drop the
flush lock before we drop the buffer lock in IO completion, and
hence if we hold the buffer lock, nothing else can actually unlock
the inode flush lock.

Yes, anything taking the flush lock needs to first hold the ILOCK -
that's always been the case and we've always done that because the
ILOCK is needed to provides serialisation against a) other
modifications while we are accessing/flushing the inode, and b)
inode reclaim.

/me checks.

After this patchset nothing calls xfs_iflock() at all - everything
uses xfs_iflock_nowait(), so it might be time to turn this back into
a plain status flag and get rid of the iflock stuff altogether as
it's just a state flag now...

Ah, the first ASSERT goes away in the next patch, I think. It was
debug, and I may have removed it from the wrong patch...

Cheers,

Dave.
