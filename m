Hi Ted,

Thanks for this detailed explanation!

Ahaha, I'm just waiting for Darrick wake up, then ask him is there any
requirement/context about this patch. Due to he (looks like) a bit
hurry to push this patch :)

If most of you prefer this way (an ./check option, not a separated wrapper
script), I'm OK with that.

Just recently I'm a bit worry about the ./check code, it's becoming more
and more complex. I hope to separate something from it, but many things
entwined, and growing. Anyway that's another story, I'll look into this
patchset and review it soon.

Thanks,
Zorro
