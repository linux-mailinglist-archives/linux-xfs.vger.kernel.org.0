The you get different inodes back.  Not really any different from
pointing your path name based code to the wrong fs or directory,
is it?

Uhh, I'm not advocating for removing ->get_parent at all.  We actually
do need that for security on NFS, where the file handles are used
undernath pathname based operations.

And it turns out my previous analysis wasn't quite sport on.  The
exportfs code always reconnects directories, because we basically
have to, not connecting them would make the VFS locking scheme
not work.

But as we never generate the file handles that encode the parent
we already never connect files to their parent directory anyway.


OTOH we should be able to optimize ->get_parent a bit with parent
pointers, as we can find the name in the parent directory for
a directory instead of doing linear scans in the parent directory.
(for non-directory files we currenty don't fully connect anwyay)
