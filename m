Yes, sending a patchset tagged CANDIDATE to linux-xfs is accepted
practice.  Usually the, er, release manager will give them the once
over, ack them, and then you can send them to gregkh for stable.

Example:

Greg will most probably NAK the whole 5.15 patchset on account of these
patches that aren't in 6.1.  <redact angry djwong rant about unfunded
