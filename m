Sorry, I made the example confusing.

How would the application deal with failure due to lack of fallocate
support?  It would have to do a pwrite, like posix_fallocate does to
today, or maybe ftruncate.  This is way I think removing the fallback
from posix_fallocate completely is mostly pointless.

Neither is appropriate for posix_fallocate because they are as
destructive as the existing fallback.

Sure, but eventually, we may get into a better situation.

Please reconsider.  If we start fixing this, we'll eventually be in a
position where the glibc fallback code never runs.

Thanks,
