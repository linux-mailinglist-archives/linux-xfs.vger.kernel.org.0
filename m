Race condition here ^^^ if we race with someone changing the debug knob,
we'll either drop something we never took, or leak something we did
take.

After the last year and a half I've gotten in the bad habit of trying to
anticipate the likely style objections of various reviewers to try to
get patches into upstream with as few objections as possible, which then
leads me down the path of more and more scope creep from the voices
inside my head:

"These cleanups should be split into smaller changes for easy
backporting."

"Setting xattr arguments via the da_args struct is a mess, make them
function parameters."

"It's nasty to have xfs_attr_change take 7 parameters, just make an
xfs_attrchange_args struct with the pieces we need, and use it to fill
out the da args internally."

"These calling conventions are still crap, transaction allocation
shouldn't even be in libxfs at all!"

"Why don't you make attr_change have its own flags namespace, and then
set attr_filter and attr_flags from that?  This would decouple the
interfaces and make them easier to figure out next time."

"There are too many little xfs_attr functions and it's really hard to
grok what they all do."

OTOH if you'd be willing to take just that attr_change bit above (with
the race condition fixed, I *would* send you that in patch form.
