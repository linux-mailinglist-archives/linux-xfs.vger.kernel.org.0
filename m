I was thinking of adapting this patch to be part of a 3 patch series 
including one of Chistophs.  Something like this:

[PATCH v6 11/16] xfs: Check for -ENOATTR or -EEXIST
[PATCH v6 03/16] xfs: Add xfs_has_attr and subroutines
[PATCH 02/29] xfs: merge xfs_attr_remove into xfs_attr_set

What would people think of that?  I figured this would be better than 
the two of us bombarding the mailing list with giant conflicting sets? 
Also, was I able to answer everyones questions on this patch?

Thanks!

Allison
