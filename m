Hmm.  I think this change makes it so that any time we add items to the
AIL, we update the head lsn, recalculate the amount of space being used
by the ondisk(?) journal, and possibly start waking threads up if we've
pushed the tail ahead enough space to somebody have some grant space?

If I grokked that, then:
