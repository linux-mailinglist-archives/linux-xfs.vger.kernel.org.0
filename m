For filesystems that /do/ support large folios (xfs), I suppose you
could have it tell iomap that it only took i_rwsem in shared mode; and
then the iomap buffered write implementation could proceed if it got a
folio covering the entire write range, or return some magic code that
means "take i_rwsem in exclusive mode and try again".

Though you're correct that we should always take IOLOCK_EXCL if the
write size is larger than whatever the max folio size is for that file.
