I'm not sure we can get much more vague than "separate commit record
IO." :P We can fairly easily distinguish between ordering of independent
commit records and ordering a particular commit record against log I/O
of its associated checkpoint. For example:

  xfs: block commit record iclog submission on previous iclog completion

... but feel free to come up with something better, use the term
ordering instead of blocking, etc.

Perhaps serialization is not the right term... I/O synchronization
perhaps? I don't know, but calling it an ordering delay is certainly not
comprehensive because it has functional ramifications..

What exactly is "iclog block rate?" Does the calculation of the new rate
factor in the implicit iclog blocking we now have by default?

Ok. I think Christoph raised a good point around storage without
volatile caches, but otherwise I find the performance tradeoff analysis
reasonable for the applicable case. Thanks.

But it also blocks where it didn't before. I'm not sure why I can't seem
to get this point across. Having thought more about this, here is a more
concrete example of the behavior change wrt to async log forces:

- Various operations populate the CIL, eventually triggers background
  CIL push.
- Background CIL push writes out the majority of checkpoint A, writes
  the commit record of checkpoint A into the current head iclog and
  returns without submitting it for I/O.
- More transactions commit and some task issues an async log force (i.e.
  xfs_log_force(.., 0);):
	- xlog_cil_push_work() submits the iclog with the commit record
	  for checkpoint A as it writes out checkpoint B.
	- xlog_wait_on_iclog_lsn() waits on ->ic_force_wait of the
	  commit record iclog for checkpoint A.
  ...

At this point, we've blocked async log force on completion processing of
a previous checkpoint because ->ic_force_wait isn't woken until the
iclog is cleaned, which doesn't occur until completion callbacks
attached to the iclog complete. This means we've technically just
changed the locking semantics for async log forces as callers must be
cognizant of locks used in the log I/O completion path.

Is this a problem? I don't know. Perhaps not, but we've had similar
issues in the past[1] in cases where an async log force unexpectedly
blocked on callback processing. The example cited was a different
waitqueue associated with the CIL context as well as being a shutdown
case that I think is no longer relevant due to more recent inode flush
reworks, etc., but it's just an example that raises concern.

So unless I'm missing something in the sequence above, I think this
requires more audit and analysis than we currently have for this
particular patch. I.e., we still have oddball cases like how
xfs_buf_lock() of a stale buffer invokes an async log force (while
potentially holding other locked items/buffers in a transaction) while
similarly an unpin of a staled buffer can cycle the buffer lock on the
log I/O completion side. Is that safe or a rathole of landmines (now and
for future code)? Perhaps a more robust option is to create a new
waitqueue specifically for the purpose of blocking iclog I/O so
historical async force rules/behavior is preserved. (We do have
->ic_write_wait, though that doesn't appear to provide ordering..).
