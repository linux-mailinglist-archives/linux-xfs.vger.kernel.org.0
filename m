So if it's called from a read verifier, the buffer will not have the
XBF_DONE flag set on it. Maybe we should assert that this flag is
set on the buffer? Yes, I know XBF_DONE will be set at write time,
but most verifiers are called from both the read and write path so
it should catch invalid use at read time...

XFS_BLI_DIRTY isn't a complete definition of a dirty buffer. What it
means is "modifications to this buffer are not yet
committed to the journal". It may have been linked into a
transaction but not modified, but it can still be XFS_BLI_DIRTY
because it is in the CIL. IOWs, transactions can cancel safely
aborted even when the items in it are dirty as long as the
transaction itself is clean and made no modifications to the object.

Hence I'm not sure what you are trying to protect against here?

The rest of the code looks fine.

Cheers,

Dave,
