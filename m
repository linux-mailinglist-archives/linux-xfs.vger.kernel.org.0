Intentional, I think, because that's how btree splits work. :) i.e.
split every level into 2 blocks, then add one for the new root. But
when the tree is already at max height, we can't split the root
block anymore so we are accounting for a split at every level except
the root block, which is a single block....

Cheers,

Dave.
