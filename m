No, the opposite. e.g. thread A does IO and then runs fsync(), which
needs to force the log, that triggers CIL push work which runs in a
different thread B.  Thread A blocks waiting for the CIL push,
thread B runs immediately.  Thread B then issues log IO, but the IO
from thread B is queued by CFQ because thread A's timeslice hasn't
expired. Hence log force is delayed until thread A's timeslice
expires, even though it is being done on behalf of thread A and
thread A is blocked until the IO from Thread B is scheduled and
completed.

No idea - I use noop for everything these days because IO schedulers
often cause more problems than they solve on SSDs, sparse virtual
machine images, thinly provisioned storage, etc....

Cheers,

Dave.
