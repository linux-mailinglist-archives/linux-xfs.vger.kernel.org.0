Yes, indeed.  Pulled!

Yes, it's the xfs-5.13-fixes-3 tag at the end of the 5.13 fixes branch.

This is a good point.  Branches should be based off of something that's
stable, recent, and relatively close to the current development work.

Ideally that would be for-next, but I hadn't actually declared that
stable yet since I just started accepting pull requests and wanted a
couple of days to make sure nothing totally weird happened with Stephen
Rothwell's integration merge.

With for-next in flux, basing your branch off the end of the fixes
branch, or an upstream Linus release some time after that, are good
enough choices... since I hadn't updated xfs-linux.git#master in a
while.

For the past 4.5 years, the pattern has always been that the most recent
fixes branch (xfs-5.X-fixes) gets merged into upstream before I create
the xfs-5.(X+1)-merge branch.  This could get murky if I ever have
enough bandwidth to be building a fixes branch and a merge branch at the
same time, but TBH if xfs is so unstable that we /need/ fixes past -rc4
then we really should concentrate on that at the expense of merging new
code.

I guess that means I should be updating xfs-linux.git#master to point to
the most recent -rc with any Xfs changes in it.

Agreed.

Whee, the modern era... :)

Agreed, though this isn't entirely a "random stable commit", it's the
end of the most recent stable branch.
