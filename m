Just as a data point: btrfs fails this test even faster than XFS.
Both with the old 3.21 fio binary and the new one.

Evidence points to this code being very poorly tested. Both
filesystems it is enabled on fail validation with the tool is
supposed to exercise and validate io_uring IO path behaviour.

Regardless of whether this is a tool failure or a kernel code
failure, the fact is that nobody ran data validation tests on this
shiny new code. And for a storage API that is reading and writing
user data, that's a pretty major process failure....

Improvements required, Jens.
