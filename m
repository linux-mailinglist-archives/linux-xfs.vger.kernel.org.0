No, I don't want to tie it specifically to physical address.
ip->i_ino is not a daddr, but it would order just fine against one.

Indeed, I don't even want to tie this specifically to a 64 bit
value; it's intended that objects will return a sort key, and as
we add more object types we'll have to think harder about the
specific key values we use.
