I think some of this memory allocation code is currently being reworked,
but that aside most of the above cases do break the retry loop if the
caller passes KM_MAYFAIL. So it's a case by case basis as to whether a
particular allocation should be allowed to fail and potentially return
an error to userspace or should continue to retry.

A more useful approach to this bug would be to describe your test, the
specific system/memory conditions, and provide the full log output
(stack trace?) associated with the issue. Then perhaps we can analyze
the cause and determine whether it's something that can be addressed or
improved, or if you just need more memory. ;)
