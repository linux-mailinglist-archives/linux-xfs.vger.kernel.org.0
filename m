If depends on the use case. I resisted converting the (xfs_lsn_t)-1s
in and around this patchset to NULLCOMMITLSN just to keep the noise
down. Where-ever we use -1 as a LSN, we should really use
NULLCOMMITLSN.

As for comparing to zero, that works because we the LSN is largely
unlikely to have 64 bit overflow in the lifetime of the journal. And
if it does overflow, it's unlikely that we'll overflow exactly to
(0,0) as a meaningful LSN.

However, I think we've probably got bigger problems around xfs_lsn_t
overflowing, such as it being defined as signed rather than
unsigned and I suspect that XFS_LSN_CMP() fails if we overflow LSNs
back to zero and compare high cycle (old) with low cycle (new) LSNs.

So, really, right now I've ostriched this issue because I'm still
trying to work throw g/482 failures and I suspect we need to change
the definition of a LSN to fix these issues...

Ok.
