That's precisely the complexity this code gets rid of. i.e. the
complex reverse pointer mapping rhashtable that had to be able to
handle rhashtable memory allocation failures and so required
fallbacks to straight buffer based unlink list walking. I much
prefer that we burn a little bit more memory for *much* simpler,
faster and more flexible code....

Cheers,

Dave.
