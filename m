Sure, that's why I was suggesting to check the quota for low free space
conditions. One one hand, a quota scan might be worth it under low quota
space conditions to avoid the heavy handed impact (i.e. flush
everything) on an fs that otherwise might have plenty of free space.
OTOH, it might be pointless if permanent -ENOSPC (due to project quota)
is imminent and we always fall back to the global scan.
