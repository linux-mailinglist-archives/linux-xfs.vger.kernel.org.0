I'd really prefer that we don't add noise like this to a bunch of
call sites.  If directories can't overflow the extent count in
normal operation, then why are we even calling
xfs_iext_count_may_overflow() in these paths? i.e. an overflow would
be a sign of an inode corruption, and we should have flagged that
long before we do an operation that might overflow the extent count.

So, really, I think you should document the directory size
constraints at the site where we define all the large extent count
values in xfs_format.h, remove the xfs_iext_count_may_overflow()
checks from the directory code and replace them with a simple inode
verifier check that we haven't got more than 100GB worth of
individual extents in the data fork for directory inodes....

Then all this directory specific "can't possibly overflow" overflow
checks can go away completely.  The best code is no code :)

Cheers,

Dave.
