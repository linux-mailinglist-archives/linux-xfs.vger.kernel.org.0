Yes, it seems to be:

   https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/posix_fallocate.c;h=7238b000383af2f3878a9daf8528819645b6aa31;hb=HEAD

And that's also what the posix_fallocate() manual page says.

Yes, I took the ext4 numbers with aio=threads

There's the overhead of handling the qcow2 metadata but QEMU keeps a
memory cache so it should not be too big.
