I was hoping you'd look at the change and then notice and
understand that the override provided was for LDFLAGS passed by
configure, not the make environment.

And that, having looked at this hunk of the patch:

-LDFLAGS = $(LLDFLAGS)
+LDFLAGS += $(LOADERFLAGS) $(LLDFLAGS)

then, perhaps, you'd see the obvious bug introduced by that change
that resulted in LDFLAGS no longer being initialised correctly and
so could be accidentally initialised from the external
environment....

I also note that you haven't observed that CFLAGS did not get
overridden in this test, despite it being specified in the
environment like LDFLAGS.

So we correctly initialise CFLAGS so it can't be overriden from
make, but we don't initialise LDFLAGS. Yeah, I noticed this a couple
of days ago, and I've been waiting for you to send the "you forgot
to initialise a varaible 13 years ago" patch after I pointed you
right at it...

Really, I should have just sent this patch when I wrote it couple of
days ago, rather than thinking that with enough information you'd
find it yourself and get credit and cudos for fixing it for us.

Gesta non verba.

xfsprogs: LDFLAGS comes from configure, not the make environment

From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

When doing:

$ LDFLAGS=foo make

bad things happen because we don't initialise LDFLAGS to an empty
string in include/builddefs.in and hence make takes wahtever is in
the environment and runs with it. This causes problems even when the
correct linker options are specified correctly through configure.

We don't support overriding build flags (like CFLAGS) though the
make environment, so it was an oversight 13 years ago to allow
LDFLAGS to be overridden when adding support to custom LDFLAGS being
passed from the the configure script. This ensures we only ever use
linker flags from configure, not the make environment.
