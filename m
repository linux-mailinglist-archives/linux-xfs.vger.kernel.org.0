...reads of the source file?  Or the destination file?  Your script
doesn't explicitly sum the source file after the EIO, so I'm guessing
the “cat $broken_source | cat > $dest; sum $dest” demonstrates that the
page cache of the source file is still ok?

Note FICLONE != clone_file_range.  FICLONE flushes dirty data to disk
and reflinks blocks; clone_file_range has a multitude of behaviors
depending on fs.  On XFS, it first will try FICLONE before falling back
to pipe copies.

So the first thing is to figure out where the EIO comes from such that
FICLONE fails.  Kernel logs would help here, since a dirty data
writeback encountering a broken disk will cause FICLONE to fail with EIO
but leave the fs running.

The second thing would be to step through the system behavior call by
call -- what is the state of $dest after the FICLONE call but before the
c_f_r.  Is it an empty file with size zero?  Is the pagecache for the
source file still intact?  That will tell us if FICLONE is somehow
stamping out files full of zeroes, or if this is a weird c_f_r behavior.

I wrote the FICLONE behavior in XFS, and AFAIK there isn't a vector by
which the $dest file would end up being 16MB all zeroed (but hey, let's
simulate this behavior and check anyway).  However, c_f_r is ... a mess,
and I wouldn't be surprised if it did something whacky like that.

Clearly c_f_r thought it had 16MB of *something* to copy here.  It would
be interesting to ftrace the xfs reflink calls to find out if it called
FICLONE a second time, or if it actually tried a pagecache copy.

Curious.  This time the FICLONE actually succeeded.  Can you “filefrag
-v $dest” here and show us if the dest file has space mapped to that 16M
or if it's sparse?

Waitaminute.  About that 16M of data that's in $broken_source -- was all
of that written to the pagecache right before the first call to cp?  I
have a theory here that if you did:

	write(src_fd, <16M of data>) = 16M
	ficlone(dst_fd, src_fd) = -EIO
	copy_file_range(dst_fd, src_fd)

Then what's going on here is that the first write call dirties 16M of
pagecache.  The FICLONE does an implied fsync() to flush the dirty data
to disk, but that writeback fails.  The pagecache does not respond to
writeback failure by redirtying the pages.  After the failed FICLONE,
the src_fd file does not have written extents allocated to it -- either
it'll be an unwritten extent, or nothing at all.

Then the second c_f_r comes along and tries FICLONE again.  This time
the "flush" succeeds because the pages are "clean" so we go ahead with
the reflink.  (Thanks, cp, for dropping the EIO!!!)  Reflink only shares
written extents, so it extends dst_fd's size without mapping any real
space to it.  That's my theory for why you see a $dest file that's 16M
and all zeroes.

(Think of FICLONE as a low-level duplicator of disk contents whose only
interaction with the page cache is to flush it at the start.)

Then you come along and manually cat $broken_source to $dest, using that
odd pipe construction:

   cat "$broken_source" | cat >"$dest"

The introduction of the pipe means that c_f_r immediately goes to the
pipe copying fallback, which reads the pagecache to the pipe; and writes
the pipe contents to $dest.  Hence this works where everything else
fails.

So I guess the question now is, what do we do about it?  The pagecache
maintainers have never been receptive to redirtying pages after a
writeback failure; cp should really pass that EIO out to userspace
instead of silently eating it; and maaaybe FICLONE should detect EIOs
recorded in the file's pagecache and return that, but it won't fix the
underlying problem, which is that the cache thinks its clean after an
EIO, and the pagecache forgets about recorded EIOs after reporting them
via fsync/syncfs.

If you rebooted the machine at the end of the script, you'd likely see
that $broken_source is either empty or also full of zeroes.  Quite
possibly $dest would have the contents, since it did manage to get its
own copy of the "clean" pagecache data and persist it.
