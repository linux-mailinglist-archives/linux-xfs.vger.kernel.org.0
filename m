Are you still working on this?

If it takes more time to understand the potential underlying problem, the fix for the problem at hand should be applied.

This is a real world problem, accidentally found in the wild. It appears very rarely, but it freezes a filesystem or the whole system. It exists in 5.7 , 5.8 , 5.9 , 5.10 and 5.11 and is caused by c7f87f3984cf ("xfs: fix use-after-free on CIL context on shutdown") which silently added a condition to the wakeup. The condition is based on a wrong assumption.

Why is this "papering over"? If a reminder was needed, there were better ways than randomly hanging the system.

Why is

     if (ctx->space_used >= XLOG_CIL_BLOCKING_SPACE_LIMIT(log))
         wake_up_all(&cil->xc_push_wait);

, which doesn't work reliably, preferable to

     if (waitqueue_active(&cil->xc_push_wait))
         wake_up_all(&cil->xc_push_wait);

which does?
