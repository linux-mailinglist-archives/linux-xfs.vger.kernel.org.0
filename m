Yeah, I think that's fine, though I think that to ensure things
end up as correct as possible:

	spin_unlock(...);
	error = xfs_mod_fdblocks(mp, -ask, 0);
	if (!error)
		xfs_mod_fdblocks(mp, ask, 0);

because if we are racing with other operations, the second
xfs_mod_fdblocks() call will put as much of @ask as needed back on
the resblks counter, and put any left over back on the percpu
counter....

Cheers,

Dave.
