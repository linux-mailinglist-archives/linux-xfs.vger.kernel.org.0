Right.

So honestly, even if the legacy fsnotify hooks can't look at the file
flag, they could damn well look at an inode flag.

And I'm not even convinced that we couldn't fix them to just look at a
file flag, and say "tough luck, somebody opened that file before you
started watching, you don't get to see what they did".

So even if we don't look at a file->f_mode flag, the lergacy cases
should look at i_fsnotify_mask, and do that *first*.

IOW, not do it like fsnotify_object_watched() does now, which is just
broken. Again, it looks at inode->i_sb->s_fsnotify_mask completely
pointlessly, but it also does it much too late - it gets called after
we've already called into the fsnotify() code and have messed up the
I$ etc.

The "linode->i_sb->s_fsnotify_mask" is not only an extra indirection,
it should be very *literally* pointless. If some bit isn't set in
i_sb->s_fsnotify_mask, then there should be no way to set that bit in
inode->i_fsnotify_mask. So the only time we should access
i_sb->s_fsnotify_mask is when i_notify_mask gets *modified*, not when
it gets tested.

But even if that silly and pointless i_sb->s_fsnotify_mask thing is
removed, fsnotify_object_watched() is *still* wrong, because it
requires that mnt_mask as an argument, which means that the caller now
has to look it up - all this entirely pointless work that should never
be done if the bit wasn't set in inode->i_fsnotify_mask.

So I really think fsnotify is doing *everything* wrong.

And I most certainly don't want to add more runtime hooks to
*critical* code like open/read/write.

Right now, many of the fsnotify things are for "metadata", ie for
bigger file creation / removal / move etc. And yes, the "don't do this
if there are no fsnotify watchers AT ALL" does actually end up meaning
that most of the time I never see any of it in profiles, because the
fsnotify_sb_has_watchers() culls out that case.

And while the fsnotify_sb_has_watchers() thing is broken garbage and
does too many indirections and is not testing the right thing, at
least it's inlined and you don't get the function calls.

That doesn't make fsnotify "right", but at least it's not in my face.
I see the sb accesses, and I hate them, but it's usually at least
hidden. Admittedly not as well hidden as it *should* be, since it does
the access tests in the wrong order, but the old fsnotify_open()
doesn't strike me as "terminally broken".

It doesn't have a permission test after the open has already done
things, and it's inlined enough that it isn't actively offensive.

And most of the other fsnotify things have the same pattern - not
great, but not actively offensive.

These new patches make it in my face.

So I do require that the *new* cases at least get it right. The fact
that we have old code that is misdesigned and gets it wrong and should
also be improved isn't an excuse to add *more* badly coded stuff.

And yes, if somebody fixes the old fsnotify stuff to check just the
i_fsnotify_mask in the inline function, and moves all the other silly
checks out-of-line, that would be an improvement. I'd very much
applaud that. But it's a separate thing from adding new hooks.
