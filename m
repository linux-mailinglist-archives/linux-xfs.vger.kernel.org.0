This is pretty much aligned with my intentions, I haven't looked close yet how
other subsystems deals with it, but by a few releases now, I keep a
xfs-fixes-$ver branch which I collect patches for the current version, so adding
a new branch for the next merge window is what I aimed to do with
xfs-6.15-merge.

The question for me now lies exactly on how to synchronize both. You partially
answered my question, although merging the current into next sounds weird to me.

If I merge current into next, and send Linus a PR for each (let's say for -rc7
and in sequence for the next merge window), Linus will receive two PRs with
possibly the same patches, and yet, on the merge window PR, there will also be a
merge commit from -current, is this what you're describing?

Thanks for the input.

Sounds reasonable
