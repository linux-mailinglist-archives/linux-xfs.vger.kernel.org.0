Subject: [PATCH v2.1 3/4] xfs: force log and push AIL to clear pinned inodes
 when aborting mount

From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

If we allocate quota inodes in the process of mounting a filesystem but
then decide to abort the mount, it's possible that the quota inodes are
sitting around pinned by the log.  Now that inode reclaim relies on the
AIL to flush inodes, we have to force the log and push the AIL in
between releasing the quota inodes and kicking off reclaim to tear down
all the incore inodes.  Do this by extracting the bits we need from the
unmount path and reusing them; as an added bonus, failed writes during
a failed mount will not retry forever.

This was originally found during a fuzz test of metadata directories
(xfs/1546), but the actual symptom was that reclaim hung up on the quota
inodes.

+ * so we need to unpin them, write them back and/or reclaim them before unmount
+ * can proceed.
+ *
+ * An inode cluster that has been freed can have its buffer still pinned in
+ * memory because the transaction is still sitting in a iclog. The stale inodes
+ * on that buffer will be pinned to the buffer until the transaction hits the
+ * disk and the callbacks run. Pushing the AIL will skip the stale inodes and
+ * may never see the pinned buffer, so nothing will push out the iclog and
+ * unpin the buffer.
+ *
+ * Hence we need to force the log to unpin everything first. However, log
+ * forces don't wait for the discards they issue to complete, so we have to
+ * explicitly wait for them to complete here as well.
+ *
+ * Then we can tell the world we are unmounting so that error handling knows
+ * that the filesystem is going away and we should error out anything that we
+ * have been retrying in the background.  This will prevent never-ending
+ * retries in AIL pushing from hanging the unmount.
+ *
+ * Finally, we can push the AIL to clean all the remaining dirty objects, then
+ * reclaim the remaining inodes that are still in memory at this point in time.
