Hm, looks like the xfs(5) manpage got updated, but it seems mkfs.xfs(8) did not.

        dax=value
               Set  CPU  direct  access (DAX) behavior for the current filesystem.
               This mount option accepts the following values:

               "dax=inode"  DAX  will  be  enabled  only  on  regular  files  with
               FS_XFLAG_DAX applied.

               "dax=never"  DAX  will  not  be enabled for any files. FS_XFLAG_DAX
               will be ignored.

               "dax=always" DAX will be enabled for all regular files,  regardless
               of the FS_XFLAG_DAX state.

               If  no  option  is  used when mounting a filesystem stored on a DAX
               capable device, dax=inode will be used as default.

               For details regarding DAX behavior in kernel, please refer to  ker‐
               nel's documentation

I'll send a patch to fix up the mkfs manpage, thanks.

Thanks,
-Eric
