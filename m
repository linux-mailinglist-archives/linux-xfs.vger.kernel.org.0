Hi folks,

I've just pushed out a new for-next branch for XFS. You can find it
here:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/xfs/xfs-linux.git for-next

This update contains the new Logged Attribute Replay functionality
that Allison has been toiling over for a very long time. She has
completely restructured how the attribute code works to lay the
ground work for functionality that require attributes to be
manipulated as part of complex atomic operations. This update
includes that functionality as a new experimental feature which can
be turned on via sysfs knob.

Great work, Allison, and thank you for all your hard work and help
during this merge window so we could get to this point!

The other functionality in the merge is the removal of all the quota
warning infrastructure. The has never been used on Linux and really
has no way of being used, so these changes clean up and remove the
remaining pieces we never will use.

At this point in the cycle (almost at -rc7) I'm not going to merge
any more new functionality. I'm planning to spend the next week:

- more thoroughly testing a wider range of configurations
- recoveryloop soak testing
- fixing up all the tests that now fail due to changes merged during
  the cycle
- addressing any regressions and failures that I find
- preparing for an early pull request during the merge window

I know of one failure that still needs to be analysed when LARP is
enabled - the new recovery test fails on 1kB block size filesystems
here. Otherwise, I did not see any unexpected failures during
overnight testing on default configs, rmapbt=1, all quotas enabled,
1kB block size or V4 only testing.

I would appreciate it if everyone could spend some cycles over the
next week running tests against this for-next branch. we've merged a
*lot* of new code this cycle so any extra test coverage we can get
at this time will help ensure we find regressions sooner rather than
later.

If I've missed anything that I should have picked up for this cycle,
please let me know ASAP so we can determine an appropriate merge
plan for it.

Cheers,

Dave.
