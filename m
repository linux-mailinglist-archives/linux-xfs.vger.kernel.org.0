I see that xlog_state_clean_iclog() wakes up tasks waiting on
iclog->ic_force_wait and that xlog_state_clean_iclog() itself is invoked after
the corresponding iclog is written to disk and the log vectors are moved to
AIL. Hence using iclog->ic_force_wait to wait for previous iclogs to complete
I/O ensures that the commit record iclog is written to disk only after the
previous iclogs have already been written.
