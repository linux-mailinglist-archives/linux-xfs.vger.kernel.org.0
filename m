People are busy, and you posted on a weekend. Have some patience,
please.

Filesystem capacity doesn't massively affect repair memory usage
these days.

The amount of metadata and the type of it certainly does, though. I
recently saw a 14TB filesystem require 240GB of RAM to repair
because, as a hardlink based backup farm, it had hundreds of
millions of directories, inodes and hardlinks in it.  Resolving all
those directories and hardlinks took 3 weeks and 240GB of RAM....

I've seen other broken backup server filesystems of similar size
that have had close on 500GB of metadata in them, and repair needs
to index and cross-reference all that metadata. Hence memory demands
can be massive, even in today's terms....

Unfortunately, I haven't seen a broken filesystem containing
extensive production use of reflink at that scale, so I can't really
say what difference that will make to memory usage at this point in
time.

So there's no one answer - the amount of RAM xfs_repair might need
largely depends on what you are storing in the filesystem.

Cheers,

Dave.
