Thank you very much.

I don't know if this is the proper place to discuss this, but I am curious
about the cause. Was it an issue with the way XFS is calling the allocator =
in a
for(;;) loop when it does not get the expected result? Or was it an issue w=
ith
the allocator itself not working in some obscure edge case? Or was it my
.config, stretching the kernel ability to function in a bad way?
