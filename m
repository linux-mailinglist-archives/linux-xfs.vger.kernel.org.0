But there isn't any such users from module now. Maybe never, since sync
polled dio becomes legacy after io_uring is invented.

Do we have such potential use case in which explicit flush plug is
needed except for polled io in __blkdev_direct_IO_simple() and swap_readpage()?

If there is, I am happy to add one flag for bypassing plug in blk core
code.

At least blkdev_write_iter(), and __swap_writepage() might call
into ->direct_IO with one plug too.

Not mention loop driver can call into ->direct_IO directly, and we
should have applied plug for batching submission in loop_process_work().


Thanks,
