It has evolved a bit since its initial proposition.  Maybe it would help 
to raise the question of: is patch 2 or 3 alone more helpful than the 
combination of them?  I think initially Dave had suggested the clean up 
in one of the earlier reviews a while ago, so he may have an opinion here.

Personally I'm not super opinionated about it if people have strong 
feelings toward keeping or pitching it.  I will say after having worked 
with it as it is, I'm not sure I'm particularly fond of having a name 
struct in the param, and another in the args.  I think eventually 
someones going to forget that args supersedes the param after the init 
routine.  People will probably figure it out pretty quick if they get 
bit I suppose, but I do think it's a sort of wart to consider.
