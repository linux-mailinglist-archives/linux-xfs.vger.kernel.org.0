It assumes verity must be stored in the attr fork and then justifies
complexity by that.

fsverity has a linear mapping.  The only thing you need to map it
is the bmap btree.  Using the dabtree helps nothing with the task
at hand, quite to the contrary it makes the task really complex.
As seen both by the design document and the code.

And you could easily map them using a single extent in the bmap
btree with no overhead at all.  Or a few more if there isn't enough
contiguous freespace.

I'm not say it's a requirement.  I'm saying it's been designed with
that in mind.  In other words it is a very natural fit.  Mapping it
to some kind of xattrs is not.

Maybe we can used it for $HANDWAVE is not a good idea.  Hash based
verification works poorly for mutable files, so we'd rather have
a really good argument for that.

It is much simpler, and more storage efficient by doing away with the
need for the dabtree entries and your new remote-remote header.
