I seem to have missed that email, too.

I guess you are refering to these two hunks:

.... that set/clear the flags on the iclog?  Yes, they probably
should be atomic.

On second thoughts, we can't just clear XLOG_ICL_NEED_FLUSH here
because there may be multiple commit records on this iclog and a
previous one might require the flush. I'll just remove this
optimisation from the patch right now, because it's more complex
than it initially seemed.

And looking at the aggregated code that I have now (including the
stuff I haven't sent out), the need for xlog_write() to set the
flush flags on the iclog is gone. THis is because the unmount record
flushes the iclog directly itself so it can add flags there, and
the iclog that the commit record is written to is returned to the
caller.

Cheers,

Dave.
