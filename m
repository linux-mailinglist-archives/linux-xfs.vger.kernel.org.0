<shrug> I don't know if they do or not; I've been so strapped for time
trying to get all these fixes out that I haven't had time to ask the
ext4 or btrfs communities, let alone propose patches.

At the moment I'd really like to get as many patches out of djwong-dev
as I can without people asking for more side projects.  As it stands
today, landing the online fsck patchset is going to involve getting 185
kernel patches, 95 xfsprogs patches, and 87 fstests patches all through
review.
