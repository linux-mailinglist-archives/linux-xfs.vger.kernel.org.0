Hmmm - I think I changed it to do that explicitly at one point, then
didn't remove it when splitting out attr2 specific stuff. e.g. the
comment now says:

/*
 * Switch on the ATTR2 superblock bit (implies also FEATURES2) by default unless
 * we've explicitly been told not to use attr2 (i.e. noattr2 mount option).
 */

Which is how it's behaving.  I'll just revert then "upgrade by
default" behaviour and go back to the way it used to work. That'll
also fix the other problem you mention, too.

Cheers,

Dave.
