In xfs_log_calc_max_attrsetm_res(), we have,

1. XFS_DAENTER_SPACE_RES() calculates the number of blocks required to add
   an xattr. It comprises of,
   - XFS_DA_NODE_MAXDEPTH
     Number of blocks required for a single split of the dabtree from the root
     to leaf.
   - XFS_DA_NODE_MAXDEPTH * XFS_BM_MAXLEVELS
     For each dabtree block allocated, the above statement assumes that we
     would need to allocate (in the worst case) blocks from the root to
     the leaf of a bmbt tree.
   This does not take into consideration the double-split that is
   possible for large sized local xattrs.
2. XFS_NEXTENTADD_SPACE_RES() once again calculates the number of bmbt blocks
   that needs to be reserved. This is already taken into consideration by
   XFS_DAENTER_SPACE_RES() macro.

   Also, the second argument to XFS_NEXTENTADD_SPACE_RES() is in units
   of bytes. This should have been specified in units of blocks.

   This is what led me to start looking into this function more thoroughly
   i.e. there was no workload that failed with the existing logic.

3. We then multiply the summation of the above numbers with the runtime
   reservation i.e. superblock + nr blocks from root to leaf of a bmbt. 
   - Superblock log space reservation is required only once per transaction.
     However, Here we end up reserving superblock log space
     for each of the blocks that we had calculated.
   - Number of blocks from root to leaf of a bmbt.
     XFS_DAENTER_SPACE_RES() already computed the number of bmbt blocks
     that needs to be allocated.
     The number of log blocks required to be reserved in the worst case should
     be (XFS_BM_MAXLEVELS + number of bmbt blocks computed by
     XFS_DAENTER_SPACE_RES()).

Sorry, My bad. I will fix this up.

Yes, That is correct.

Lets say that a leaf block is split. This would mean that the contents of two
blocks would have changed. Hence we would need to log both the blocks. In the
worst case we would need to log changes for all the splits from root block to
the leaf block.

Yes, that is correct.

XFS_NEXTENTADD_SPACE_RES() seems to be right macro to invoke.

Yes, The behaviour is same for filesystem space reservation
calculation. However, The idea behind this patch is to make
xfs_attr_calc_size() to also calculate the log space reservation.

Without this patch, xfs_log_calc_max_attrsetm_res() would return 555768 blocks
as the log space reservation. After fixing the second argument of
XFS_NEXTENTADD_SPACE_RES() to be a "block count" instead of "byte count",
xfs_log_calc_max_attrsetm_res() would return 262904 blocks as the log space
reservation.

With this patch applied (along with converting the return value of
xfs_calc_buf_res() to blocks), xfs_log_calc_max_attrsetm_res() returns 3187
blocks as the log space reservation.

Actually, I found the flaw in xfs_log_calc_max_attrsetm_res() when debugging
an xfstests failure after extending the per-inode attribute extent counter to
32-bits.

Yes, the above looks correct. I will make the required changes and post the
report the patches. Thanks for the review comments.
