Hi all,

I've noticed that fstests doesn't document what the test groups mean.  I
attempted to document what each group seems to symbolize, to reduce the
amount of confusion for new contributors.  While doing so, I noticed
that there were a handful of tests that aren't in the right group.  The
first three patches dix that problem.  The next test adds a build-time
check to ensure that all groups are listed in the documentation file so
that we don't lose track of things.  The last patch updates ./new to use
the documentation file instead of having to build group.list files.

v2: fix the 'subvolume' group tests, tweak some of the wordings of the
    group description file, add missing license declarations, remove the
    one-off overlay group
v2.1: move the group name documentation checks into the preamble code so
      we don't have to have a second script
v3: cleanup cleanups to mkgroupfile and don't allow new 'other' group
    tests
v4: split the ./new script cleanups into a separate series; add review
    tags; no other changes

If you're going to start using this mess, you probably ought to just
pull from my git trees, which are linked below.

This is an extraordinary way to destroy everything.  Enjoy!
Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
