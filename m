Why can't this deal with ZONE_DEVICE pages?  It certainly has
nothing do with a LRU I think.  In fact being able to have
stats that count say the number of device pages here would
probably be useful at some point.

In general I find the vm_normal_lru_page vs vm_normal_page
API highly confusing.  An explicit check for zone device pages
in the dozen or so spots that care has a much better documentation
value, especially if accompanied by comments where it isn't entirely
obvious.

Overly long line here.

Please properly indent comments.

Another overly long line here.
