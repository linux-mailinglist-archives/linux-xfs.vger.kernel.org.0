Ok. I think I had the (wrong) impression that all we had to do was
create the whiteout dentry and the inode magic would happen elsewhere in
overlayfs or something, but in reality overlayfs only cares about the
magic inode and DT_WHT basically just saves us from allocating a
physical inode.

Yep, makes sense.

Heh, Ok. That all seems proper enough reason to keep the existing rename
whiteout code around for a while. Thanks.
