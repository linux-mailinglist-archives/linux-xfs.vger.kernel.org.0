I snipped the part where you explained the way it currently avoided
reading the parts of the page that the block being dirtied didn't
cover :)

Right, we can do that, but it would be an entire page read, I think,
because I see little point int doing two small IOs with a seek in
between them when a single IO will do the entire thing much faster
that two small IOs and put less IOP load on the disk. We still have
to think about impact of IOs on spinning disks, unfortunately...

Ah, I missed that bit. I thought it was just starting from a fully
allocated file and a cold cache, not a primed, hot cache...

Cheers,
