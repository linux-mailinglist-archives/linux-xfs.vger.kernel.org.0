I think you are largely on your own, then, in terms of recovering
from this. I'd guess that the proprietary RAID implementation is not
power-fail safe....

AFAICT, that doesn't tell you that the data in the files is intact,
just that it can access them.

Keep in mind that whilst UFS-explorer reports ~321000 files in the
filesystem, the superblock state reported by phase 2 of xfs_repair
that there should be ~405000 files and directories in the filesystem
(icount - ifree):

....
sb_icount 407296, counted 272960
sb_ifree 2154, counted 1676
....

So, at minimum the damage to the inode btrees indicates that records
for ~130000 allocated files are missing from the inode btrees, and
that there should be ~80,000 more files present than UFS-explorer
found. IOWs, be careful trusting what UFS explorer tells you is
present - it looks like it may not have found a big chunk of the
data present that xfs_repair was trying to recover (and probably
going to attach to lost+found) when it crashed.

580         /* don't allow reflink/cowextsize if we don't have reflink */
581         if ((flags2 & (XFS_DIFLAG2_REFLINK | XFS_DIFLAG2_COWEXTSIZE)) &&
582              !xfs_has_reflink(mp))
583                 return __this_address;
584
585         /* only regular files get reflink */
586         if ((flags2 & XFS_DIFLAG2_REFLINK) && (mode & S_IFMT) != S_IFREG)
587                 return __this_address;
588

From the inode dump:

v3.flags2 = 0x8

Which is XFS_DIFLAG2_BIGTIME, so neither the REFLINK or COWEXTSIZE
flags are set. That means repair has changed the state of the inode
in memory if we've got the REFLINK flag set.

And there we are. After junking a number of blocks in the directory
because of bad magic numbers in phase 4, repair does this:

setting reflink flag on inode 15192014216

Which implies that there the multiple references to at least one of
the data blocks in the directory. This should not be allowed, so
the problem here is that repair is marking the directory inode as
having shared extents when this is not allowed. Hence we trip over
the inconsistency when rebuilding the directory and abort.

Ok, so that's a bug in the reflink state rebuild code - we should be
checking that inodes that shared extents have been found for are
regular files and if they aren't removing the block from the inode.

I'll look at this in a couple of weeks when I'm back from holidays
if our resident reflink expert (Darrick) doesn't get to it first....

Cheers,

Dave.
