Yeah, that makes sense. My broader concern was addressing the situation
where we aren't lucky enough to glean original alignment from the fs.
Perhaps we could 1.) update the warning message to unconditionally
recommend an alignment and 2.) if nothing is gleaned from secondary
supers (and all your above conditions apply), calculate and recommend
the max alignment that accommodates the root inode chunk..? It might not
be the original value, but at least guides the user to a solution to
quiet the warning..
