From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

When the AIL tries to flush the CIL, it relies on the CIL push
ending up on stable storage without having to wait for and
manipulate iclog state directly. However, if there is already a
pending CIL push when the AIL tries to flush the CIL, it won't set
the cil->xc_push_commit_stable flag and so the CIL push will not
actively flush the commit record iclog.

generic/530 when run on a single CPU test VM can trigger this fairly
reliably. This test exercises unlinked inode recovery, and can
result in inodes being pinned in memory by ongoing modifications to
the inode cluster buffer to record unlinked list modifications. As a
result, the first inode unlinked in a buffer can pin the tail of the
log whilst the inode cluster buffer is pinned by the current
checkpoint that has been pushed but isn't on stable storage because
because the cil->xc_push_commit_stable was not set. This results in
the log/AIL effectively deadlocking until something triggers the
commit record iclog to be pushed to stable storage (i.e. the
periodic log worker calling xfs_log_force()).

The fix is two-fold - first we should always set the
cil->xc_push_commit_stable when xlog_cil_flush() is called,
regardless of whether there is already a pending push or not.

Second, if the CIL is empty, we should trigger an iclog flush to
ensure that the iclogs of the last checkpoint have actually been
submitted to disk as that checkpoint may not have been run under
stable completion constraints.
