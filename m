At which point, we know that all the free extents in that AG are
either busy or we are truly out of space. Hence if this search
fails, it makes sense to call xfs_extent_busy_flush() to wait for
all the busy extents in the AG to complete their processing before
trying again.

Seems like you broke the existing handling of this situation by
preventing the AGFL filling code from flushing the busy extents when
all the AG can find is busy extents.

Sure, I never suggested that we completely elide log forces. What I
said is that we -shouldn't immediately resort to a log force- because
the first maxlen extent match we come across is busy and can't
immediately be reused.

That is, the code still needs to call xfs_extent_busy_flush() and
try the allocation again, it just needs to do it when no candidate
extent can be found instead of after the first candidate is found to
be busy.

I still don't think this is right approach because it tries to
correct a bad decision (use a busy extent instead of trying the next
free extent) with another bad decision (log force might not unbusy
the extent we are trying to allocate). We should not do either of
these things in this situation, nor do we need to mark busy extents
as being in a transaction to avoid deadlocks.

That is, if all free extents are busy and there is nothing we can
allocate in the AG for the AGFL, then flush the busy extents and try
again while we hold the AGF locked. Because we hold the AGF locked,
nobody else can create new busy extents in the AG while we wait.
That means after a busy extent flush any remaining busy extents in
this AG are ones that we hold busy in this transaction and are the
ones we need to avoid allocating from in the first place.

IOWs, we don't need to mark busy extents as being in a transaction
at all - we know that this is the only way we can have a busy extent
in the AG after we flush busy extents while holding the AGF locked.
And that means if we still can't find a free extent after a busy
extent flush, then we're definitely at ENOSPC in that AG as there
are no free extents we can safely allocate from in the AG....

Cheers,

Dave.
