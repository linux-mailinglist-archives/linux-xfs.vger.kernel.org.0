bio_endio() doesn't wait for completion or all the IO in progress.

In fact, if we have chained bios still in progress, it does
absolutely nothing:

void bio_endio(struct bio *bio)
{
again:
>>>>>   if (!bio_remaining_done(bio))
                return;

and so we return still with the memory we've put into the buffers in
active use by the chained bios under IO. On error, we'll free the
allocated buffer immediately, and that means we've got a
use-after-free as the bios in progress still have references to it.
If it's heap memory we are using here, then that's a memory
corruption (read) or kernel memory leak (write) vector.

So we have to wait for IO completion before we return from this
function, and AFAICT, the only way to do that is to call
submit_bio_wait() on the parent of the bio chain to wait for all
child bios to drop their references and call bio_endio() on the
parent of the chain....

Cheers,

Dave.
