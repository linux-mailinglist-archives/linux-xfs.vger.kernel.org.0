Can you move this helper function up to early in the patch set?
That way the code gets simpler and less tangled before adding
all the new state machine gubbins?

I suspect that you should do this for all the functions the state
machine breaks up into gotos, too. THat way adding the state machine
is really just changing how the functions that do the work are
called, rather than jumping into the middle of long functions....

I know, it turns it into a longer series, but it also means that all
the refactoring work (which needs to be done anyway) can be
separated and merged while we are still reviewing and working on the
state machine based operations, thereby reducing the size of the
patchset you have to manage and keep up to date over time....

Cheers,

Dave.
