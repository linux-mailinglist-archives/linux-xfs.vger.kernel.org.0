I tested virtual environment and raw hardware both.

We have a testing machines pool which contains lots of different machines,
include real machines, kvm, and other kind of vm, include different
rches (aarch64, s390x, ppc64le and x86_64), and different kind of
storage (virt, hard RAID, generic scsi disk, pmem, etc...). They all hang
on fstests generic/051.

I remembered Darrick said he did test with ~160 VMs (need confirmation
from him).

So this issue might not be related with VMs or real machine. Hmm... maybe
related with some kernel config? If Darrick would like to provide his .config
file, I can make a diff with mine to check the difference.

Thanks,
Zorro
