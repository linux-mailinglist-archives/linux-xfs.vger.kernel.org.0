Hmmm.  I've never come up with a good name for this flag.  The caller
actually has a *specific* length in mind; it simply doesn't want to trip
the assertions on the cached buffers that have a different length but
won't be returned by *this* call.

If the buffer cache has bufs for daddr 24 len 8 and daddr len 120, the
scan calls xfs_buf_get as follows:

daddr 24 len 1 (nothing)
daddr 24 len 2 (nothing)
...
daddr 24 len 8 (finds the first buffer)
...
daddr 24 len 120 (finds the second buffer)
...
daddr 24 len 132 (nothing)

I don't want the scan to ASSERT 130 times, because that muddles the
output so badly that it becomes impossible to find relevant debugging
messages among the crap.

Can I change it to XB[FM]_IGNORE_MISMATCHES?

Let's say there's a filesystem with dirblksize 8k.  A directory block
gets crosslinked with an xattr block.  Running the dir and xattr
scrubbers each will create a new cached buffer -- an 8k buffer for the
dir, and a 4k buffer for the xattr.  Let's say that the dir block
overwrote the attr block.  Then, the xattr read verifier will fail in
xfs_trans_buf_read, but that doesn't remove the buffer from the cache.

I want the xattr repair to be able to scan the buffer cache and examine
both buffers without throwing assertions all over the place, because
that makes it harder to debug repair.
