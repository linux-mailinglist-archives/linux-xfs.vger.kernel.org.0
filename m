pr_debug is largely useless outside of code development purposes.

The value in tracepoints is that they are available for diagnosing
problems on production systems and should be thought of as such.
Yes, you can also use them to debug development code, but in that
environment they are no substitute for custom trace_printk() debug
output.

However, when you have extensive tracepoints coverage, the amount of
custom trace_printk() stuff you need to add to a kernel to debug an
issue ends up being limited, because most of the key state and
object changes in the code are already covered by tracepoints.

For people who are used to subsystems with extensive tracepoint
coverage (like XFS), the lack of tracepoints in all the surrounding
code is jarring. It makes the rest of the system feel like a black
hole where detailed runtime introspection is almost completely
impossible without a *lot* of work.

Extensive tracepoints help everyone in the production support
and diagnosis chain understand what is going on by providing easy to
access runtime introspection for the code. i.e. they provide
benefit to far more people than just the one kernel developer who
enables pr_debug on the subsystem when developing new code...
