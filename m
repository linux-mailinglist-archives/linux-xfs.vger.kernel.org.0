What I want to know here is *how* do we get to the point of tripping
this assertion via debugknob?  Won't the lookup or seek operation have
already checked the block and failed with EFSCORRUPTED?  And shouldn't
that be enough to stop whatever code calls xfs_btree_islastblock?  If
not, how do we get there?

Seriously, I don't want to burn more time discussing where and how to
fail on debugging knobs when there are all these other **far more
serious** corruption and deadlock problems that people are trying to get
merged.

Tell me specifically how to make the system fail.  "It's confusing and
strange" is not good enough.
