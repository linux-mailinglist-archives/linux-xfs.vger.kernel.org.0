I have another patch that drops it completely from
xfs_quiesce_attr() because it is largely unnecessary. That got
tangled up in a fixing other bugs in the patchset, so I dropped it
to get this out the door rather than have to rewrite the patch
-again-.

Essentially, xfs_quiesce_attr() used inode reclaim to flush dirty
inodes that the VFS didn't know about before we froze the
filesystem. It's a historical artifact that dates back to before we
logged every change to inodes, as AIL pushing couldn't clean
unlogged inode changes.  We don't actually need to reclaim inodes
here now that xfs_log_quiesce() pushes the AIL and waits for all
metadata writeback to complete.

Cheers,

Dave.
