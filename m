fstests doesn't generate anywhere near the load necessary to measure
log space accounting cacheline contention. That's one of the things
I use fsmark workloads for.

One of the things that "20% reduction" tells me, though, is that 80%
of the time that relogging is happening with this patch we are in a
tail pushing situation. i.e. the log is more often full than it is
empty when we are relogging.

That tends to support my statements that this is optimising the
wrong case.

FWIW, it seems to me that we need real stats for the deferops (i.e.
exposed in /proc/fs/xfs/stat) so we can monitor in realtime the
breakdown of work that is being done. Being able to see things like
how many defer rolls a transaction takes under a given workload is
very interesting information, and would give us insight into things
like whether the log count for transaction reservations is
reasonable or not....

Cheers,

Dave.
