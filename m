Sorry, the previous explaination I had provided earlier was not clear
enough. I hope the following will add more clarity.

The bottom line is that extent count reservation cannot guarantee that a
future "directory entry remove" operation will always have sufficient amount
of "extent count" left in the inode's data fork extent count.

Doubling the extent count that gets reserved during directory entry insert
operation can leave a minimum of XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT extent count units
free after the operation is completed. But this extent count can be consumed
away by a directory entry remove operation that ends up freeing directory
blocks due to the fact that it can cause extent count of directory inode to
increase by XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT units.

For example, Assume that a directory's data fork extent count is X and it has
the following extent record in its bmbt,

 | Y | Y+1 | Y+2 |

Here Y is the offset within the directory. The directory blocks are within the
same extent record since they are contiguous in terms of both file offset and
disk offset. Now, if a directory entry remove operation is executed, it can
free the block Y+1. This causes an increase in the extent count.

So a single directory entry remove operation has the potential to increase
extent count by XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT units in the worst case (one data
block, one free disk block and 5 dabtree blocks). Hence reserving an extra
XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT units of extent count during directory entry insertion
would not help solve the problem.

The above mentioned scenario can be further extended:
If a directory has (2 * XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT) units of free extent count
left, two directory entry remove operations can potentially increase extent
count by XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT units each and hence the execution of a third
consecutive directory entry remove operation fails due to lack of availability
of free extent count.

A related problem has already been solved in XFS.

File deletion can fail in the case of low disk space scenarios. This happens
because of failure to successfully reserve disk blocks for "directory entry
remove" transaction. In such a case, xfs_remove() allocates a transaction with
tp->t_blk_res set to 0. During the execution of the operation, if we end up
having to remove a block (say a "directory data block") from the directory,
the following events could occur,

1. xfs_bmap_del_extent_real(): Extent count increases because the block that
   is being unmapped from bmbt occurs in the middle of an extent record.
2. We truncate the length of the existing extent record and try to insert a
   new extent record which maps the blocks of the original extent record that
   occurs after the block being freed.
3. The following sequence of functions are invoked if inserting a new record
   requires a btree block to be split,
   xfs_btree_insert() => xfs_btree_insrec() => xfs_btree_make_block_unfull()
   => __xfs_btree_split() => xfs_bmbt_alloc_block()
4. xfs_bmbt_alloc_block() returns -ENOSPC when it notices tp->t_blk_res having
   a value of 0.
5. Upon receiving -ENOSPC return value, xfs_bmap_del_extent_real() restores
   the original extent record.
6. Invokers of xfs_dir2_shrink_inode() (e.g. xfs_dir3_data_block_free()) would
   ignore the -ENOSPC error code and hence the corresponding directory block
   is not freed. It is left to a future user of the block to be able to free
   it.

I think we have to use a similar approach to solve the "undeletable directory"
problem. To that end, I have written a patch which implements the following
logic,

W.r.t directory entry remove operation, we check for extent count overflow in
xfs_bmap_del_extent_real() only when the block being unmapped could cause an
increase the extent count overflow. If unmapping can cause extent count to
overflow, xfs_bmap_del_extent_real() would return -ENOSPC, causing the
invokers of xfs_dir2_shrink_inode() to ignore -ENOSPC and leaving the
responsibility of freeing the directory block for future.

For "directory rename operation", the explanation provided for "directory
entry remove" operation holds for the "source directory entry". For rename's
destination directory entry, we now check for extent overflow only when we
have successfully reserved non-zero blocks for the transaction. This is
because with zero block-sized reservation, the rename either
1. Fails due to non-availability of space in existing directory blocks for
   holding the new directory entry.
2. Succeeds since the directory has enough space in existing blocks to hold
   the new directory entry. In this case, XFS wouldn't add new blocks to the
   directory.

For the remaining directory operations (e.g. create, link and symlink) we
continue to reserve XFS_IEXT_ATTR_MANIP_CNT units of extent count before the
corresponding transaction starts dirtying metadata.

The ideal way to test this patch would be to have a directory whose extent
count has reached the maximum limit and also has an extent record with atleast
three blocks. Freeing directory entries occupying the middle block in such an
extent record would trigger the -ENOSPC error code handling described above.

However, I don't think it is possible to deterministically create such a
directory layout by executing commands from userspace. Hence my testing was
limited to, 
1. Fill a directory with entries until the maximum extent count limit is
   reached. Remove the corresponding directory. The remove operation should
   succeed.
2. Regular run of fstests with various mount options.

As described above reserving twice the amount of extent count units during
xattr insertion would not guarantee a future xattr remove operation to obtain
extent count reservation successfully. Hence to always allow xattr remove
operation, we have to implement some of the logic associated with "directory
remove operation". This includes adding the ability to swap dabtree
block (whose removal can cause -ENOSPC to be returned from xfs_bunmapi()) with
the last block of the xattr dabtree (i.e. the logic implemented by
xfs_da3_swap_lastblock()). Please let me know if you prefer this approach to
be implemented instead of file deletion.
