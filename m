Not necessary - the way the shutdown code runs now we guarantee
that XFS_OPSTATE_SHUTDOWN is set *before* we set XLOG_IO_ERROR.
Hence we'll never see XLOG_IO_ERROR without XFS_OPSTATE_SHUTDOWN.

Yeah, I can't give you a bright line answer to that right now. We've
smeared the abstraction between log and mount for a long while now,
and the result is that it's not clear what is log and what is mount
functionality.

That's one half - the other half is....

... yeah, this.

Like the CIL, the AIL belongs to the log, not to the mount.
Similarly, log items belong to the log, not the transaction
subsystem. The transaction subsystem is the interface layer between
the mount and the log - code from above that interacts with
transaction knows only about mounts and so they all use
xfs_is_shutdown().

The transactions interface with the log via log tickets and log
items, which are provided by the log, not the transaction subsystem.
Anything that operates on or manages the log, log tickets or log
items should typically use xlog_is_shutdown().

This means subsystems that are used both from the mount and log
log levels (e.g. xfs_buf.c) has a difficult line to straddle.
However, it's worth noting that high level transaction buffer read side 
does mount shutdown checks (e.g. in xfs_trans_read_buf_map()) and
so that largely allows the low level buffer code to only have to
care about log level shutdowns. Hence the check in
__xfs_buf_submit() is converted to a log level check so that it
doesn't abort buffer log item writeback before the log is shut down.

Hence I think working out what the right thing to do is short term
pain while we work through re-establishing the log vs mount
abstractions correctly.

I've got various patchsets I've been working on over the past year
that clean a fair bit of this this up. However, they are kindai
intertwined through the patchsets that provide CIL scalability,
intent whiteouts, in-memory iunlink intents, log ticket cleanups,
log ticket/grant head scalability (byte tracking, not LSNs), moving
AIL push targeting into the AIL instead of setting targets from
transaction reservation, moving iclogs behind the CIL and removing
log force shenanigans, etc. because I've done cleanups as I've
touched various bits of the code...

The dquot flush code already does an immediate shutdown on flush
failure, too. see xfs_qm_dqflush():

out_abort:
	dqp->q_flags &= ~XFS_DQFLAG_DIRTY;
	xfs_trans_ail_delete(lip, 0);
	xfs_force_shutdown(mp, SHUTDOWN_CORRUPT_INCORE);

Cheers,

Dave.
