Sure, but that's only a problem for operations that are a pure
log format change. With parent pointers, we have an INCOMPAT bit
because we have a new attr filter bit that older kernels will flag
as corruption, and that means we don't need a log incompat bit for
the attr logging. IOWs, if xfs_has_parent_pointers() is true, then
we don't need to set the ATTRI log incompat bit, ever, because the
parent pointer incompat feature bit implies ATTRI log items are in use and all
kernels that understand the PP incompat bit also understand the
ATTRI log items....

Well, we only clear it from the xfs_log_worker() if the log needs
covering, so the AIL and iclogs need to be empty before the worker
will clear the incompat bit. That's on a 30s timer already, so
perhaps all we need to do is extend the log covering timeout if
there are incompat log flags set....

It's tempting, but let's try to put that off until we really need
to....
