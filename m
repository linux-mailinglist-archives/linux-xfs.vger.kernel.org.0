Yeah, I=E2=80=99m very wary of reporting these tracebacks as potential =
bugs because of them easily being just a hint on slow storage. My =
problem here is that I can=E2=80=99t point to anything that says the =
storage would have been slow.

I=E2=80=99ve gone through all metrics and logs on the KVM servers as =
well as the Ceph servers and they=E2=80=99ve been performing completely =
at baseline level regarding errors, queues, iops, latency.

I=E2=80=99ve done a measurement to try to emulate those accesses by =
running

$ fio --rw=3Drandrw --name=3Dsynctest --bs=3D4k --direct=3D1 --numjobs=3D1=
 --ioengine=3Dlibaio --iodepth=3D1 --runtime=3D600 --write_barrier=3D1 =
--size=3D60m

I hope this is sufficiently comparable behaviour (maybe with a different =
read/write ratio instead of 0.5?) to what XFS log flushing does. This =
resulted in [1].=20

My interpretation of this measurement (and the VM showed no illnes while =
this was running over 10 minutes): the VM is throttled at 250 IOPs and =
is reporting back after 10 minutes of 4k random writes with average IOPS =
of exactly 250. The latencies are a bit varied, this could be due to =
Qemu throttling. The max latency was 133ms, the average 2ms. This is on =
a 10g storage network with Ceph that requires another network roundtrip =
for replication before ACKing a write.

There is one more (somewhat far fetched thing) I could pull in here: out =
of 11 VMs that have seen that are exhibiting those symptoms I have seen =
two (including one already running on 6.12 at that time) that did log a =
stacktrace[2] that reminded me of the memory/folio issue we debugged =
late last year / earlier this year =
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2024/9/12/1472)) =E2=80=A6 maybe it=E2=80=99s =
worthwhile to consider whether this might be related. The outside =
symptoms are similar: it recovers on its own at some point and I can=E2=80=
=99t show any issue with the underlying storage at all.

I=E2=80=99m out of ideas for now, I=E2=80=99ll keep thinking about this. =
If anyone has any pointer for further tests in any direction, I=E2=80=99m =
open to anything. ;)

Thanks for all the help so far,
Christian
