I can unfold it here in this patch too if people prefer. I'm getting the 
impression that others are having a hard time keeping up with the 
refactoring, so maybe that might be better.


 From my perspective, I think we want

Sure, I think that describes what you have up there

Right, ok, will make those modifcations here then.  Thanks for the 
reviews!  I know it's a lot.
