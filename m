Math errors.

Callers of xfs_refcount_adjust_extents are supposed to split (and
update) any refcount records that cross the start or end of the range
that we're adjusting.  This guarantees that _adjust_extents will stop at
exactly the end of a refcount record.

However, if a record in the middle of that range has a blockcount that
is longer than *aglen at the point that we encounter the record, we'll
increment agbno beyond the range that we were supposed to adjust.  This
happens either because we fuzzed the refcountbt deliberately, or ...
because we actually did write the refcountbt record block but due to
bugs on the vm host, the write was silently dropped and memory pressure
caused the xfs_buf to get reclaimed and reloaded with stale contents.

(That's an argument for making xfs_refcount_adjust_extents check that
*aglen never underflows; I'll update the patch.

Oh.  I already wrote that patch, but forgot to add it to this series.
Sigh.)

If agbno is now large enough that the segmented xfs_fsblock_t points
into a nonexistent AG, bad things will happen.

<shrug> Based on reviewer feedback over the last few years I got in the
habit of putting the actual bug fixes at the front of the series.
Patches adding more layers of checking so that we can die gracefully
ended up after that.
