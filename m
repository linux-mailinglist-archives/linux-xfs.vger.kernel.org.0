Did you run the /entire/ fstests suite?  With this patch applied to
5.12-rc2, I keep seeing list corruption assertions about an hour into
the test run, and usually on some test that heavily exercises allocating
and deleting file extents.  I'll try to look at this patch more closely
next week, but I figured I should let you know early, on the off chance
something sticks out to you.
