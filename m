Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker. Top-posting
for once, to make this easily accessible to everyone.

Has any progress been made to fix below regression? It doesn't look like
it from here, hence I wondered if it fall through the cracks. Or is
there some good reason why this is safe to ignore?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
