What is your proposal for how to address this?  I'm not really sure
I'd call it a "vulnerability", per se.  If the user is relying on a
particular ACL to deny access using negative access, and they copy the
file somewhere that doesn't support Posix ACL's, this is the natural
and expected effect.

There are plenty of ways this could happen beyond the one that you've
describe.  For example, they could copy the file to a file system that
doesn't support ACL's at all (such as say a FAT file system).  They
could create a tar file.  They could use rsync or scp to copy the
directory hierarcy, etc.

Further, I'll note that NFS (sometimes fondly referred to by security
folks as "No File Security") relies on the client asserting the user
id accessing the file.  (Yes, in theory NFS could use Kerberos or
GSSAPI to provide user-level authentication, but in practice, this is
**extremely** rare.)  Furthermore, the system administration policies
of the client might very well be different from the server.  For
example, users might have physical access to the client, making it
trivially possible to gain root, where as the server might be in a
locked machine room.

For example, consider how we used Kerberos authentcation, NFS, and the
fact that users could trvially get root on their local clients[1] at
MIT Project Atenna back in the late 1980's.

I'll also note that in general, the scenario assumes that files are
accessile via local file access as well as remotely over some kind of
remote file accesss (e.g., CIFS or NFS).  Don't do that.  If you are
trying to supply access to legacy Windows machines using CIFS, then
access the files from Linux using CIFS as well, and then rely solely
on the Windows ACL model.  Otherwise, even if the files aren't getting
copied, the access checks when the files are access locally are
different from when they are accessed via some kind of remote access
protocol, whether it's a remote file system like NFS, or something
like WEBDAV.

I the user is copying it from a file hiearchy using Posix ACL, to a
different file system hierarchy, then how is that different from the
"security vulnerability" where the user copies it to a USB thumb
drive, and then takes the USB thumb drive out, and hands it to a spy?
Oh, noes!!!

Fundamentally, if you don't trust the user (either because they might
be malicious, or because they are incompetent), Discretionary Access
Controls (DAC) are not going to help you.  This is why Mandatory
Access Controls (MAC) were invented.  Of course, MAC's are extremely
painful to use, and so in practice almost no one tries to use MAC
today.  Military organizations might use it if they have unlimited
budget, but even there, it's often easier to have separate systems for
unclassified informations and for classified information, and you
control physical access via armed guards and the signs saying "Deadly
Force is Authorized".  :-)
