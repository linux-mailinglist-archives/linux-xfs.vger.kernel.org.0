Hi,

Thanks a lot.

'xfs_repair -L' works well to replace a xfs logdev.
# kernel: 4.18.0-348 / 5.15.21

but a qestion 'cleanly unmounted' below.

'mount -o logdev=/dev/newlogdevice' failed,
# kernel: 4.18.0-348(centos 8.5) / 5.15.21

the message in dmesg:
Corruption warning: Metadata has LSN (1:6) ahead of current LSN (1:0).
Please unmount and run xfs_repair (>= v4.3) to resolve.

/dev/newlogdevice is with a same size, and zeroed by blkdiscard(SSD)

'umount' is not enough to get  a  ' cleanly unmounted'?
