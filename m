Changes since V3[1]:
 - For the first patch, simply place the modification logic in the
   xfs_fsmap_owner_to_rmap() function.
 - For the second patch, more detailed comments were added and related
   changes were made to the initialization of the end_daddr field.

This patch set contains two patches to repair fsmap. Although they are both
problems of missing query intervals, the root causes of the two are
inconsistent, so two patches are proposed.

Patch 1: The fix addresses the interval omission issue caused by the
incorrect setting of "rm_owner" in the high_key during rmap queries. In
this scenario, fsmap finds the record on the rmapbt, but due to the
incorrect setting of the "rm_owner", the key of the record is larger than
the high_key, causing the query result to be incorrect. This issue is
resolved by fixing the "rm_owner" setup logic.

Patch 2: The fix addresses the interval omission issue caused by bit
shifting during gap queries in fsmap. In this scenario, fsmap does not
find the record on the rmapbt, so it needs to locate it by the gap of the
info->next_daddr and high_key address. However, due to the shift, the two
are reduced to 0, so the query error is caused. The issue is resolved by
introducing the "end_daddr" field in the xfs_getfsmap_info structure to
store the high_key at the sector granularity.
