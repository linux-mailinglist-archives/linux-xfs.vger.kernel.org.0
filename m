I suspect that there's an underlying bug in the overlapping CIL
commit record sequencing. This commit will be the first time we are
actually getting overlapping checkpoints that need ordering via the
commit record writes. Hence I suspect what is being seen here is a
subtle ordering bug that has been in that code since it was first
introduced but never exercised until now..

I haven't had any success in reproducing this yet, I'll keep trying
to see if I can get it to trigger so I can look at it in more
detail...

Cheers,

Dave.
