Agreed, it would be nice to clean that up. BUT, the chunk_sectors sysfs
attribute file is reporting the zone size today. Changing that may break
applications. So I am not sure if we can actually do that, unless the sysfs
interface is considered as "unstable" ?

The only thing I can think of which would make sense is to avoid torn writes
with SAS drives. But in itself, that is extremely niche.
