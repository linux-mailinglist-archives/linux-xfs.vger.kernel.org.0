If I follow correctly, you're saying that prior to commit 7f6aff3a29b0,
log recovery would run a CRC pass on a clean log (with an unmount
record) and this is where the old workaround code would kick in if the
filesystem happened to be misformatted by mkfs. After said commit, the
CRC pass is no longer run unless the log is dirty (for arch
compatibility reasons), so we fall into the xlog_check_unmount_rec()
path that does some careful (presumably arch agnostic) detection of a
clean/dirty log based on whether the record just behind the head has a
single unmount transaction. This function already uses h_len properly
and only reads a single log block to determine whether the target is an
unmount record, so doesn't have the same overflow risk as a full
recovery pass.

Am I following that correctly? If so, the patch otherwise looks
reasonable to me:
