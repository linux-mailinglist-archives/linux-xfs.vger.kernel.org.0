That's just me trying to get as close to the psuedo code as possible, 
but if the concern is just to keep the state management in this scope, I 
may move it back down into the the XFS_DAS_RM_SHRINK case where it was, 
I think it looks a little cleaner there.

So it would go back down here like this, which is more akin to the 
original code flow:

Sure, I'll add in another patch for that extra helper in the next set. 
Thanks for the review!
