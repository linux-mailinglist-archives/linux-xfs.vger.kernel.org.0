How is that different from the plain xfs_inode fields?  In fact I suspect
most of the initializers cn just be removed entirely, so I'll look into
preloading that at the front of the series.

I don't think we have any coverage of that, at least I didn't see any
extra failures.

Because we need them so that we put the right value in the log when
logging the inode core.  Otherwise a log recovery might clear these
values.  The only thing I could do is add a log incompat flag set
on a kernel that removes the field and then not apply changes to these
two fields when recoverying the log on a file system with that flag
set.
