I read bits and pieces about cp --reflink, I guess using that would be
a more "standard" *nix way of using dedupe? For example cp --reflink 
then
using rsync to do a delta sync against the new copy(to get the updates?
Not that I have a need to do this just curious on the workflow.

Thanks for confirming that, it's what I suspected.

ok thanks for the info. I do see a couple of times there are periods of 
lots
of disk reads on the source and no writes happening on the destination
I guess it is sorting through what it needs to get, one of those lasted
about 20mins.

Good to know, certainly would be nice if there was at least a way to
identify a file as having X number of links.

I'm sure I did not do that either, but I can do that if you think it
would be advantageous. I do plan to ship this DL380Gen10 XFS system to
another location and am happy to reformat the XFS volume with that extra
option if it would be useful.

I don't anticipate needing to deal directly with this reflinked data,
just let Veeam do it's thing. Thanks for clearing things up for
me so quickly!
