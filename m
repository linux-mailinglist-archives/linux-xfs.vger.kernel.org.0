I wasn't planning to modify pages for reasons mentioned earlier. It's a
non-trivial jump in complexity for the problem I'm trying to address.

Possibly.. I've not looked at it. First and foremost what I'm really
trying to do here is find a better way to deal with the truncate flush
problem that moves things closer to the long term goal of being handled
by iomap.

I'd have to take a closer look. If the IOMAP_F_STALE thing is
essentially a superset of what I was trying to do wrt to the retry thing
(which is what it sounds like), then I agree it makes sense to reuse
that.

The problem I have is that I've got three or four additional different
prototypes trying to do such things that haven't even been worth posting
because they all produce tricky to diagnose issues, including one that
literally does exactly what you note above regarding dropping FGP_CREAT
for mappings trimmed down based on sub-extent dirty state. It probably
has its own bugs, but I suspect aspects of iomap zeroing as well as
extent reporting in XFS (related to zeroing) need to change to make this
all function correctly, but I don't have it characterized enough to say
for sure.

Ok, this may be a reasonable end goal, but there's a clear jump in
complexity, dependency requirements, and test scope between the targeted
fix I proposed and ultimate iomap zeroing perfection. I'm not trying to
achieve the latter. I'm trying to address a performance escalation that
moves things more in that direction to the degree possible.

I agree that if IOMAP_F_STALE overlaps with the approach in this patch,
it makes no sense to try and duplicate that here or create code
conflicts or dependencies. I have another version of this patch that
implements the same dirty check, flush, retry logic within
xfs_iomap_buffered_write_iomap_begin() such that it never returns a
"dirty," hole/unwritten mapping. It's a bit more code, but effective
from a functional and performance standpoint and logically simple enough
to backport as far back as needed with minimal risk and dependencies.
IMO, that's a fairly reasonable intermediate step to get from the
currently broken state to a more ideal iomap-based implementation. I'll
post it shortly and run some more testing against it.
