yes, the iclogs are written sequentially to the log - we don't
switch the log->l_iclog pointer to the current active iclog until we
switch it out, and then the next iclog in the loop is physically
located at a higher lsn to the one we just switched out.

It's handled by the XFS_LSN_CMP(prev_lsn, start_lsn) < 0 check.  if
the prev_lsn is zero because the iclog is clean, then this check
will always be true.

He was wondering what devices benefited from this. It has no impact
on highspeed devices that do not require flushes/FUA (e.g. high end
intel optane SSDs) but those are not the devices this change is
aimed at. There are no regressions on these high end devices,
either, so they are largely irrelevant to the patch and what it
targets...

Cheers,

Dave.
