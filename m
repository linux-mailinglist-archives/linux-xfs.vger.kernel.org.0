My understanding is that the regrant mechanism is intended to deal with
that scenario. Even after the initial (res * logcount) reservation is
consumed, a regrant is different from an initial reservation in that the
reservation head is unconditionally updated with a new reservation unit.
We do wait on the write head in regrant, but IIUC that should be limited
to the pool of already allocated transactions (and is woken before the
reserve head waiters IIRC). I suppose something like this might be
possible in theory if we were blocked on regrant and the entirety of
remaining log space was consumed by transactions waiting on our ilock,
but I think that is highly unlikely since we also hold the iolock here.

Also note that this approach is based on the current truncate algorithm,
which is probably a better barometer of potential for this kind of issue
as it is a less specialized operation. I'd argue that if this is safe
enough for truncate, it should be safe enough for range shifting.

Yep, for insert range at least.

We'd have to reorder the extent split for that kind of approach, which I
think you've noted in the sequence above, as the race window is between
the split and subsequent shift. Otherwise I think that would work.

That said, I'd prefer not to introduce the extra complexity and
functional variance unless it were absolutely necessary, and it's not
clear to me that it is. If it is, we'd probably have seen similar issues
in truncate and should target a fix there before worrying about range
shift.
