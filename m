Alrighty, I am fine with a *_iter scheme then

Yes, sorry, it's used in the next patch series when we get into to the 
real delayed attr infrastructure.  I just forgot to take it out of the 
smaller subset here.

Basically all the use cases thus far already have args initialized, but 
in the log replay, we have to construct args from the log entry.  So we 
need the extra state to not re-initialize it every time and wipe out the 
state.  That use case is little more unique in that we have to set up 
the state machine after the ping pong has already started.

Ok, I will introduce the states progressively then, I think that caused 
the confusion

Yes, as it is, it doesn't really have any way of detecting a corrupt 
state.  Really though, if we want to do that what we need is another 
layer of modeling where we enforce the sequence of the states.  So for 
example, some sort of mapping or tree that defines: XFS_DC_LEAF_TO_NODE 
and XFS_DC_FOUND_LBLK as being children (or mappings) of 
XFS_DC_SF_TO_LEAF.

In other words, if the state is XFS_DC_SF_TO_LEAF, you can change it to 
XFS_DC_FOUND_LBLK or XFS_DC_LEAF_TO_NODE, but you can't go to say 
XFS_DC_RM_SHRINK, that would generate an error.  And then we have some 
sort of set_state() routine to enforce these rules.

That's a lot of extra overhead though, and could be more of a burden 
than a help.  But it's something we could explore if people think it's 
worth the pursuit.
