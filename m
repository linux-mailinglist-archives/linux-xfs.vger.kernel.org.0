There's a lot of "if's" there. :/

All I'm asking for is that the changes are documented as known and
intentional so that we don't end up a couple of years down the track
wondering WTF we were thinking when we made this change...

The xfsctl(3) man page already says this:

       XFS_IOC_PATH_TO_HANDLE
       XFS_IOC_PATH_TO_FSHANDLE
       XFS_IOC_FD_TO_HANDLE
       XFS_IOC_OPEN_BY_HANDLE
       XFS_IOC_READLINK_BY_HANDLE
       XFS_IOC_ATTR_LIST_BY_HANDLE
       XFS_IOC_ATTR_MULTI_BY_HANDLE
       XFS_IOC_FSSETDM_BY_HANDLE
		These are all interfaces that are used to implement
		various libhandle functions (see open_by_handle(3)).
		They  are  all  subject  to change and should not be
		called directly by applications.

and the open_by_handle(3) man page says "use libhandle to access
these functions".

Cheers,

Dave.
