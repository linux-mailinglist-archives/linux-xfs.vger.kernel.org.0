The rmap btree can become a big btree, but the per-ag rmapbt reservation
ensures that there's enough free space to refill the AGFL to handle the
rmap btree expanding to its maximum allowable size.  XFS_AG_RESV_RMAPBT
is subtracted from fdblocks, so I don't think alloc_set_aside ought to
withhold even more blocks from xfs_mod_fdblocks.

IOWS, I was wrong earlier -- we only need to withhold enough space from
fdblocks to handle splits of the bnobt and cntbt at or near ENOSPC.  The
value 4 is actually correct, but needs much better explanation.
Especially for benefit of the original author. ;)

Right.

There are three callers of xfs_alloc_min_freelist(, NULL) now.  One of
them is the the function that does the root inode calculation, which we
only use in mkfs and repair.

The other two are xfs_alloc_set_aside and xfs_alloc_ag_max_usable, and
we already cache the return value of those two functions, so I don't see
why we need to cache xfs_alloc_min_freelist separately?

(Or even touch it at all, really...)
