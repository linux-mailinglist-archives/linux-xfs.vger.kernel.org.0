THis is after we've emitted an "Ending recovery ...." log message.
I kinda expected you to move this up to just after the
evict_inodes() call before we force the log, push the AIL, drain
the buffers used during recovery and potentially turn the
"filesystem is read-only" flag back on.

i.e. if this is a recovery operation, it should be done before we
finish recovery....

Other than that, the change is fine.

Cheers,

Dave.
