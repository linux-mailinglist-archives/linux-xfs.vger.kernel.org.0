The current commit log says it's either rare or doesn't occur in
practice, which leaves the question open. I'm pointing out that for the
codepaths affected by this patch, I don't think it can occur.

I agree that it's still a theoretical possibility based on the current
log item interface and intent item implementations...

Ok, then I'd just suggest to update the commit log. I guess it's easier
for me to just suggest one, so for example (feel free to use, modify or
replace):

---

iop_unlock() is called when comitting or cancelling a transaction. In
the latter case, the transaction may or may not be aborted. While there
is no known problem with the current code in practice, this
implementation is limited in that any log item implementation that might
want to differentiate between a commit and a cancel must rely on the
aborted state. The aborted bit is only set when the cancelled
transaction is dirty, however. This means that there is no way to
distinguish between a commit and a clean transaction cancel.

For example, intent log items currently rely on this distinction. The
log item is either transferred to the CIL on commit or released on
transaction cancel. There is currently no possibility for a clean intent
log item in a transaction, but if that state is ever introduced a cancel
of such a transaction will immediately result in memory leaks of the
associated log item(s). This is an interface deficiency and landmine.

To clean this up, replace ->iop_unlock() with an ->iop_release()
callback that is specific to transaction cancel. The existing
->iop_committing() callback occurs at the same time as ->iop_unlock() in
the commit path and there is no need for two separate callbacks here.
Overload ->iop_committing() with the current commit time ->iop_unlock()
implementations to eliminate the need for the latter and further
simplify the interface.

---

I'll try to get through the rest of this series today..
