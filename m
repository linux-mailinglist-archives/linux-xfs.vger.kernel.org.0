That might be reason enough for a feature bit. I've been waffling on the
idea personally just because I'm a little concerned the existence of it
might lead to overengineering of what ends up tied to it, but really if
it existed for the mere purpose of backwards compatibility and letting
newer ones spit out a warning for "absent or insufficient grow"
situations, that seems pretty reasonable to me.

That said, I do think it's only really useful for the approach where
we'd rely on growfs to fix up the fs before it should be used in
production. If we ended up just changing mkfs to enforce larger AGs or
whatever then it seems unnecessary IMO.

Definitely seems like a reasonable mkfs time approach to me.

I'm going to post a prototype of the dynamic AG size grow thing shortly.
The heuristic I hacked in for that is basically to try for 4xAGs or
otherwise set a minimum AG size of 4GB. IOW, a tiny fs that sees small,
incremental grows would come out of single AG mode as soon as the fs
size crosses 4GB plus the minimum number of blocks for a runt second AG.

Note that I'm not convinced any user would actually do such a thing with
cloud fs images, so this is more just trying to be robust and cover the
unexpected use cases than anything else. The larger point though is I
don't see why mkfs couldn't do something similar with a runt AG if we
wanted to go that route.

Hm yeah. One of the things I've discussed with Eric a bit is how all
over the place and unknown the use cases seem to be. I actually think
there's benefit in just doing something simple with an abstracted mkfs
param because if whatever initial heuristic we come up with isn't the
best, it won't be any worse than current default behavior and we at
least start to get some feedback and can iterate on it.

Sure, I've no strong opinion on the size limit.. Another thing Eric
brought up that I'm not sure about with the whole "min file size" idea
is whether any cloud environments would have issues with larger images
because sparse files aren't handled efficiently enough by their infra,
for whatever reason.

That seems like something that's easy enough to address with compression
and such, but practicality doesn't always line up with theory and if
that's not something that's tied well enough into the cloudy management
infrastructure such that admins just don't use it, then that kind of
defeats the purpose. I'm really not sure either way.. :/

Anyways, to be continued.. I'm curious on any thoughts you and others
might have on the prototype.
