From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

Most buffer io list operations are run with the bp->b_lock held, but
xfs_iflush_abort() can be called without the buffer lock being held
resulting in inodes being removed from the buffer list while other
list operations are occurring. This causes problems with corrupted
bp->b_io_list inode lists during filesystem shutdown, leading to
traversals that never end, double removals from the AIL, etc.

Fix this by passing the buffer to xfs_iflush_abort() if we have
it locked. If the inode is attached to the buffer, we're going to
have to remove it from the buffer list and we'd have to get the
buffer off the inode log item to do that anyway.

If we don't have a buffer passed in (e.g. from xfs_reclaim_inode())
then we can determine if the inode has a log item and if it is
attached to a buffer before we do anything else. If it does have an
attached buffer, we can lock it safely (because the inode has a
reference to it) and then perform the inode abort.
