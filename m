I agree that this warrants a bit more explanation and analysis before
changing the current code...

... but I'm a little confused by this assertion. The shadow buffer
allocation code refers to the possibility of shadow buffers falling out
that are smaller than currently allocated buffers. Further, the
_insert_format_items() code appears to explicitly optimize for this
possibility by reusing the active buffer, subtracting the old size/count
values from the diff variables and then reformatting the latest
(presumably smaller) item to the lv.

Of course this could just be implementation detail. I haven't dug into
the details in the remainder of this thread and I don't have specific
examples off the top of my head, but perhaps based on the ability of
various structures to change formats and the ability of log vectors to
shrink in size, shouldn't we expect the possibility of a CIL context to
shrink in size as well? Just from poking around the CIL it seems like
the surrounding code supports it (xlog_cil_insert_items() checks len > 0
for recalculating split res as well)...
