Ok, so basically we allocate the mp earlier so the mount api stuff can
do mount option parsing and such, the vfs allocs the sb and transfers
->s_fs_info from the context to the sb and thus at this point the
responsibility to free mp transfers from xfs_fc_free() to either
xfs_fill_super() (on error) or xfs_fs_put_super(). Makes sense I think,
thanks for the explanation (though again I think this is the kind of
thing that should be documented in the commit log).

So what is the expected behavior if a failure occurs after sget_fc()
does the ->s_fs_info transfer and before fill_super() is called?

Ok.

So the intent is that in the event of a fill_super() failure as
described above, the ->s_fs_info transfer would have already happened
and fc->s_fs_info would be NULL, right?
