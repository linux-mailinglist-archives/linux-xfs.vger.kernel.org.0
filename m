Thanks a lot for valuable info.

I'm sorry I was not clear. Test [1] does not measure "available space" between
kernel releases. It just run df command with parameters, saves it's output
and compares "1024-blocks" and "Used" columns of df output with stat output:

		local total=$(stat -f mntpoint --printf=%b)
		local free=$(stat -f mntpoint --printf=%f)
		local used=$((total-free))

		local bsize=$(stat -f mntpoint --printf=%s)
		total=$((($total * $bsize + 512)/ 1024))
		used=$((($used * $bsize + 512) / 1024))

And comparison with "$used" is what sometimes fails.

BTW this happens on both distros when loop device is on tmpfs. I'm trying to
trigger it on ext4 and btrfs, not successful so far. Looks like it's tmpfs
related.

If that's really expected, we might remove this check for used for XFS
(not sure if check only for total makes sense).

Interesting. Which one of these two is not supported on tmpfs?

Kind regards,
