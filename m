Yes, though it's the existing code that relies on the external push to
block until everything is written back or a permanent error is issued.
This patch just splits up and rate limits a warning message. I added the
assert because of the previous discussion around making sure this
situation is handled properly and because that error processing
dependency is not obvious.

Sure, I'll add a comment..
