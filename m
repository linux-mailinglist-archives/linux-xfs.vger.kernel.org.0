Hi all,

In reviewing how xfs_scrub classifies errors, I noticed that there were
numerous things that could be improved.

First, I fixed some of the error reports that were simply in the wrong
category.

Next, I cleaned up some of the internal logic and error class tables in
preparation for future patches.

Then, I noticed that corruptions and some of the runtime errors were
being munged into a single errors_found counter.  I made this the
explicit corruptions counter, which can be incremented via
str_corrupt().  I then changed str_error() to mean runtime errors.

Having done that, I was then able to reclassify some str_info calls that
are really reporting runtime errors and therefore should use str_error.

Finally, I introduce a new category of errors that are unfixable by
scrub, and assign to this class all the media errors since there's
nothing XFS can do.

If you're going to start using this mess, you probably ought to just
pull from my git trees, which are linked below.

This is an extraordinary way to destroy everything.  Enjoy!
Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
