I think for !lazysbcases, sb buffer lock is only a reliable lock that
can be relied on for serialzing (since we need to make sure each sb
write matches the corresponding fdblocks, ifree, icount. So sb buffer
needs be locked every time. So so need to recalc on dirty log.)

I know what you mean, but there exists 3 things:
 1) we be64_add_cpu() on-disk fdblocks, ifree, icount at
    xfs_trans_apply_sb_deltas(), and then do the same bahavior in
    xfs_trans_unreserve_and_mod_sb() for in-memory counters again.
    that is (somewhat) fragile.

 2) m_sb_lock behaves no effect at this. This lock between
    xfs_log_sb() and xfs_trans_unreserve_and_mod_sb() is still
    sb buffer lock for !lazysbcount cases.

 3) in-memory sb counters are serialized by some spinlock now,
    so I'm not sure sb per-CPU counters behave for lazysbcount
    cases, are these used for better performance?

not sure that is quite equal to blkdelta, since (I think) we might need
to apply t_res_fdblocks_delta for !lazysbcount cases but not lazysbcount
cases, but I'm not quite sure, just saw the comment above
xfs_trans_unreserve_and_mod_sb() and the implementation of
xfs_trans_apply_sb_deltas().

Thanks,
