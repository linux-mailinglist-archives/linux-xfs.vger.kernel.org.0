Darrick, it bugged me a bit that the way this patch worked was to go through
one set of calculations to sort out a log size, then throw in a new heuristic
or two to change that result.  And TBH the 7/8 bit seems very ad hoc when
we already had the prior 95% heuristic.

While I know that most of this goes away by the last patch, I'm considering
deferring patches 4 & 5 for the next release because of the impact on
fstests, so would like to land somewhere clean by patch 3.

What do you think of this patch as a replacement for this patch 3/5? It's a
bit clearer to me, and results in (almost) the same net results as your patch,
with minor differences around 512MB filesystems due to the removal of the
7/8 limit.

Depending on what you think, I can tweak your commit log as needed, leave
your authorship, and add a:

[sandeen: consolidate heuristics into something a bit more clear]

or something like that... or, claim authorship (and all ensuing bugs) ;)

Thanks,
-Eric
