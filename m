It's probably better to fix slob to be able to tell that a kmem_free'd
object actually belongs to a cache and should get freed that way, just
like its larger sl[ua]b cousins.

However, even if that does come to pass, anybody /else/ who wants to
start(?) using XFS on a SLOB system will need this patch to fix the
minor papercut.  Now that I've checked the rest of the codebase, I don't
find it reasonable to make XFS mutually exclusive with SLOB over two
instances of slab cache misuse.  Hence the RVB. :)
