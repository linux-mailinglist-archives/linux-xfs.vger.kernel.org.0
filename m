I'm confused about "the warning this presents" -- are you talking about
this patch specifically, where we couldn't figure out the weird masking
behavior that dated back to 2001 and the hysterical raisins?

Or are you referring to Brian's criticism of earlier versions of this
series that would whine about our root inode computation not leading to
the root inode without actually telling the user what to do about it?

If it's the second, then I the answer is that I added another patch
("xfs_repair: try to correct sb_unit value from secondaries") to try to
recover a working sunit value from the backup superblocks, or try some
power of two guesses to see if we find one that matches, and then reset
the value to something that will make the computation work again.
