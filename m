I asked myself that question too.  I found three callers of this
predicate:

1. fallocate, which should have obtained freeze protection

2. inodegc, which should never be running when we get to the innermost
freeze protection level

3. xfs_release, which doesn't take freeze protection at all.  Either it
needs to take freeze protection so that xfs_free_eofblocks can't get
stuck in xfs_trans_alloc, or we'd need to modify xfs_trans_alloc to
sb_start_intwrite_trylock

I don't really want to try to add (3) as part of a fix for 5.19, but I
would like to get these fixes merged so I can concentrate on finding and
fixing the file corruption problems that are still present in -rc4.  If
we want to engineer a freeze/ro state check later, we can do that too.

So, can we move ahead with this fix?
