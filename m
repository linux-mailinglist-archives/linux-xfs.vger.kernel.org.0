A slightly unfortunate side effect of this is that there's seemingly no
straightforward way for a user to "clear" this state/warning. We've
solved the major problem by allowing repair to handle this condition,
but AFAICT this warning will persist unless the stripe unit is changed
back to its original value.

IOW, what if this problem exists simply because a user made a mistake
and wants to undo it? It's probably easy enough for us to say "use
whatever you did at mkfs time," but what if that's unknown or was set
automatically? I feel like that is the type of thing that in practice
could result in unnecessary bugs or error reports unless the tool can
make a better suggestion to the end user. For example, could we check
the geometry on secondary supers (if they exist) against the current
rootino and use that as a secondary form of verification and/or suggest
the user reset to that geometry (if desired)? OTOH, I guess we'd have to
consider what happens if the filesystem was grown in that scenario too..
:/

(Actually on a quick test, it looks like growfs updates every super,
even preexisting..).
