Yes, it would have, so I switched strategies...

...completely away from making any code changes to the verifier.
So to answer your question, it should not be a factor any more.

Making corrections at iget time is complicated -- of the callers that
pass in a transaction, I'd would have to check every call site carefully
to ensure that we don't cancel what would otherwise be a clean
transaction, since that would lead to a shutdown.  The non-transaction
iget callsites would each have to grow a call to get a transaction,
update the inode, and commit it.  We'd have to be careful to make sure
that all new iget callsites do this properly, forever.  We could make
the change nontransactionally and wait for someone to log the icore to
persist the changes, but that's always frowned upon.

That's why I decided to go with making updates in xfs_trans_log_inode,
since (a) it's not going to burn a bunch of human time, (b) it's where
we perform other silent inode upgrades, and (c) it doesn't generate any
new log traffic.

However, I just had a thought--

This patch doesn't do anything to fix the case of existing realtime
regular files with an invalid hint.  The only time the invalid hint
actually bites us is in xfs_bmap_rtalloc.  To fix that case, all I need
to do is amend xfs_trans_log_inode to fix realtime files too, and then
update xfs_bmap_rtalloc:

	align = xfs_get_extsz_hint(ap->ip);

to check for bad hints:

	align = xfs_get_extsz_hint(ap->ip);
	if (align > mp->m_sb.sb_rextsize &&
	    align % mp->m_sb.sb_rextsize)
		align = mp->m_sb.sb_rextsize;

If the allocation succeeds, then the rt file's inode (which is already
ijoined) gets logged, at which point we'll correct the inode.

Yes, but with the reviewer costs mentioned above.
