This links back to a conversation we started about improving the
review process.

One of the questions was regarding RVB being too "binary".
If I am new to the subsystem, obviously my RVB weights less, but
both Darrick and Dave expressed their desire to get review by more
eyes to double check the "small details".

To that end, Darrick has suggested the RVB be accompanied with
"verified correctness" "verified design" or whatnot.

So instead of a binary RVB, Brian could express his review
outcome in a machine friendly way, because this:
"TBH, I think this patch should probably be broken down..."
would be interpreted quite differently depending on culture.

My interpretation is: "ACK on correctness", "ACK on design",
"not happy about patch breakdown", "not a NACK", but I could
be wrong.

Then, instead of a rigid rule for maintainer to require two RVB
per patch, we can employ more fine grained rules, for example:
- No NACKs
- Two RVB for correctness
- One RVB for design
- etc..

Also, it could help to write down review rules for the subsystem
in a bureaucratic document that can be agreed on, so that not
every patch needs to have the discussion about whether breaking
this patch up is mandatory or not.

There is a big difference between saying: "this patch is too big for
me to review, I will not be doing as good a job of review if it isn't
split into patches" and "this patch has already been reviewed,
I already know everything there is to know about it, there are no
bisect-ability issues, but for aesthetics, I think it should be broken down".
I am not saying that latter opinion should not be voiced, but when said
it should be said explicitly.

High coding standards have gotten xfs very far, but failing to maintain a
healthy balance with pragmatism will inevitably come with a price.
Need I remind you that the issue that Dave is fixing has been affecting
real users and it has been reported over three years ago?

Thanks,
Amir.
