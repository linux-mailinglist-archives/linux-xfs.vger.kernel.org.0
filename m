Yes, but there's a big difference between 2MB and 256KB, especially
if it's a small filesystem (very common) and the log is only ~10MB
in size.

Log buffers are static memory footprint. Page cache memory is
dynamic and can be trimmed to nothing when there is memory pressure
However, memory allocated to log buffers is pinned for the life
of the mount, whether that filesystem is busy or not - the memory is
not reclaimable.

THe 8 log buffers of 32kB each is a good trade-off between
minimising memory footprint and maintaining performance over a wide
range of storage and use cases. If that's still too much memory per
filesystem, then the user can compromise on performance by reducing
the number of logbufs. If performance is too slow, then the user can
increase the memory footprint to improve performance.

The default values sit in the middle ground on both axis - enough
logbufs and iclog size for decent performance but with a small
enough memory footprint that dense or resource constrained
installations are possible to deploy without needing any tweaking.

Cheers,

Dave.
