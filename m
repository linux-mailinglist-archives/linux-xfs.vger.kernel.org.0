Oh, ok, I hadn't thought about how we could change the buffer after the
fact, I was thinking "nothing should change"

Honestly this isn't critical, it was a trivially backportable fix for the weird
inode thing that Zorro fixed earlier, but with that in place it's not really
necessary.

I could go either way here too.  If we want to rerun verifiers by resetting
the type, that's fine.
