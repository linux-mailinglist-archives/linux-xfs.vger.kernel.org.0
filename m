<nod> And even more pointless now that we've effectively mandated 64M
logs for all new filesystems.

<nod> Ok, that's what I thought I was seeing -- the target is now a
little more dynamic, which means a "push all" will be more aggressive,
with perhaps less latency spikes later.

Aha!  There's the missing piece, thank you.

...and thank you for the reminder of why that was there, because I was
puzzling over what that (now removed) line of code was doing.

<nod> I'll resume reading now.
