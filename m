None specifically, but it's a feature, albeit a poorly documented and
previously broken one.  VFS quotas don't seem to have any warning
limits, so I suppose there's not a lot of precedent to go on.

That said -- I don't how gutting a feature (especially since it's now
been *working* for a year and a half) is the solution here.  If you
think the default warning limit is too low, then perhaps we should
increase it.  If you don't like that a single user operation can bump
the warning counter multiple times, then propose adding a flag to the
dqtrx structure so that we only bump the warning counter *once* per
transaction.  "It's never worked" is not true -- this fix was added for
5.9, and it's now shipped in two LTS kernels.

On the other hand, if you think this feature is totally worthless and it
should go away, there's a deprecation process for that.
