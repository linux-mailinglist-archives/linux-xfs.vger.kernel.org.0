This looks like another symptom of the same "bio sizes in writeback
are now unbound if contiguous physical pages are added to them"
problem I raised here when considering a similar hard lockup report
with a 2GB bio:

This looks like another instance of the same problem...

It really does look like iomap needs to cap the length of ioend and
bio chains...
