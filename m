Log recovery on those old kernels will choke on the 16-bit xfs_extent
records, because they only know how to interpret a 12-bit xfs_extent.
In 2.6.17, xlog_recover_do_efi_trans did this:

	efi_formatp = (xfs_efi_log_format_t *)item->ri_buf[0].i_addr;
	ASSERT(item->ri_buf[0].i_len ==
	       (sizeof(xfs_efi_log_format_t) +
		((efi_formatp->efi_nextents - 1) * sizeof(xfs_extent_t))));

The ASSERT will trigger on the size being wrong due to the padding
error, but on non-DEBUG kernels that won't interrupt log recovery, so we
proceed on to this:

	memcpy((char *)&(efip->efi_format), (char *)efi_formatp,
	      sizeof(xfs_efi_log_format_t) +
	      ((efi_formatp->efi_nextents - 1) * sizeof(xfs_extent_t)));

In this particular case, we fail to copy the all of the bytes from the
recovered EFI into the new incore EFI log item.  If there is more than 1
extent, the fields in the (N+1)th incore extent won't line up with the
fields that were written to disk, which means we'll replay garbage.
