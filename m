1-3 are bug fixes. 4-6 are dependent on 1 and they expand the range
of AGs that can be allocated in when a single AG is at ENOSPC. We
have had users reporting premature ENOSPC being reported to
applications in this exact situation in the past (maybe half a dozen
in the past decade or so?), so it is a bug fix of sorts. It's not a
critical bug fix, though, as it's not a common problem.
