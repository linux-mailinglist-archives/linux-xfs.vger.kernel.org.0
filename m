As an addendum to that, in the long run I will just fix it so that
_read_buf callers pass all the necessary context info through to the
verifiers and all of this will go away, but before that gets to RFC
status I need to iterate all the use cases that I can think of.

I /think/ all we need is an AG number, a XFS_HEALTH code, and some
combination of a (struct xfs_inode *) or an inode number to cover all
the cases of owner verification and automatic reporting of corruptions
to the health reporting subsystem.
