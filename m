Yes，:) right！According to the method you said, we can also solve this 
problem.
The key to sloving this problem is to make sure that all log IO is done 
before
tearing down AIL.

I'm agree with your opinion,but, I have verified that it can indeed 
solve the UAF.
And, I also verify the way you suggested, it is equally effective.
But, I have no better idea where to place this check, hope for your 
better suggestions.
Here I provide a way for reference,would you kindly consider the 
following modifications,
thanks in advance :)
