Comments documenting what was done previously are a bit of a weird
style, as the reader generally could not care less what there was
previously.

Looks good.  I wonder if we should have a helper for this through,
as basically any compare function taking 64-bit values will have the
same boilerplate.

I suggest to add a helper like:

/*
 * Compare to signed 64-bit values and return an signed 32-bit integer
 * value that is 1, -1 or 0 for various compare callbacks.
 */
static inline int cmp_s64(s64 a, s64 b)
{
	if (a > b)
		return 1;
	else if (b > a)
		return -1;
	return 0;
}

and then the above just comes:

	return cmp_s64(be64_to_cpu(k1->bmbt.br_startoff),
		       be64_to_cpu(k2->bmbt.br_startof));

and we can probably clean up various other places inside (and outside,
but we can leave that for others) as well.  I'll cook up a patch if
you feel this is not worth your time.
