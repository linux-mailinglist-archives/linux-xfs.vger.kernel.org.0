If relogging ends up getting widely used, then a filesystem global
lock in the transaction reserve path is guaranteed to be a
contention point. :)

xlog_write() code handles a missing commit iclog pointer just fine.
Indeed, that's the reason xlog_write() may issue log IO itself:

....
        spin_lock(&log->l_icloglock);
        xlog_state_finish_copy(log, iclog, record_cnt, data_cnt);
        if (commit_iclog) {
                ASSERT(flags & XLOG_COMMIT_TRANS);
                *commit_iclog = iclog;
        } else {
                error = xlog_state_release_iclog(log, iclog);
        }
        spin_unlock(&log->l_icloglock);

i.e. if you don't provide xlog_write with a commit_iclog pointer
then you are saying "caller does not call xfs_log_release_iclog()
itself, so please release the iclog once the log iovec has been
written to the iclog. Hence the way you've written this code
explicitly tells xlog_write() to issue log IO on you behalf if it is
necessary....

A clean transaction has XLOG_TIC_INITED set, so xfs_log_done() will
never call xlog_commit_record() on it. XLOG_TIC_INITED is used to
indicate a start record has been written to the log for a permanent
transaction so it doesn't get written again when it is relogged.....

.... Hmmmm .....

You might be right.

It looks like delayed logging made XLOG_TIC_INITED completely
redundant. xfs_trans_commit() no longer writes directly to iclogs,
so the normal transaction tickets will never have XLOG_TIC_INITED
cleared. Hence on any kernel since delayed logging was the only
option, we will never get log writes from the xfs_trans* interfaces.

And we no longer do an xlog_write() call for every item in the
transaction after we format them into a log iovec. Instead, the CIL
just passes one big list of iovecs to a singel xlog_write() call,
so all callers only make a single xlog_write call per physical log
transaction.

OK, XLOG_TIC_INITED is redundant, and should be removed. And
xfs_log_done() needs to be split into two, one for releasing the
ticket, one for completing the xlog_write() call. Compile tested
only patch below for you :P

I don't recall that discussion steering away from stealing
reservations; it was more about mechanics like using transaction
callbacks and other possible mechanisms for enabling relogging.

Right, it wasn't clear how to best implement this at the time,
because we were all just struggling to get our heads around the
problem scope. :)

Essentially, yes.

And the reloggable items and reservation can be clearly documented
in the per-transaction reservation explanation comments like we
already do for all the structures that are modified in a
transaction.

Yes - we acquire the initial relog reservation by stealing it
from the current transaction. This gives the AIL ticket the reserved
space (both reserve and write grant space) it needs to relog the
item once.

When the item is relogged by the AIL, the transaction commit
immediately regrants the reservation space that was just consumed,
and the trans_roll regrants the write grant space the commit just
consumed from the ticket via it's call to xfs_trans_reserve(). Hence
we only need to steal the space necessary to do the first relogging
of the item as the AIL will hold that reservation until the high
level code turns off relogging for that log item.

So concurrent "active relogging" + "start relogging" + "stop
relogging"?

Right, did you notice the ail->ail_relog_lock rwsem that I wrapped
my example relog transaction item add loop + commit function in?

i.e. while we are building and committing a relog transaction, we
hold off the transactions that are trying to add/remove their items
to/from the relog list. Hence the reservation stealing accounting in
the ticket can be be serialised against the transactional use of the
ticket.

It's basically the same method we use for serialising addition to
the CIL in transaction commit against CIL pushes draining the
current list for log writes (rwsem for add/push serialisation, spin
lock for concurrent add serialisation under the rwsem).

RIght, that's the whole problem that we solve via a) stealing the
initial reserve/write grant space at commit time and b) serialising
stealing vs transactional use of the ticket.

That is, after the roll, the ticket has a full reserve and grant
space reservation for all the items accounted to the relog ticket.
Every new relog item added to the ticket (or is relogged in the CIL
and uses more space) adds the full required reserve/write grant
space to the the relog ticket. Hence the relog ticket always has
current log space reserved to commit the entire set of items tagged
as reloggable. And by avoiding modifying the ticket while we are
actively processing the relog transaction, we don't screw up the
ticket accounting in the middle of the transaction....

yup, that's the delta size updates from the CIL commit. i.e. if we
relog an item to the CIL that has the XFS_LI_RELOG flag already set
on it, the change in size that we steal for the CIL ticket also
needs to be stolen for the AIL ticket. i.e. we already do almost all
the work we need to handle this.

Yes, but it's a problem the CIL already solves for us :P

I don't think we need any of that - the AIL ticket only needs to be
kept up to date with the changes to the formatted size of the item
marked for relogging. It's no different to the CIL ticket
reservation accounting from that perspective.
