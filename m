Dave Chinner complained about xfs_scrub failures coming from xfs/158.
That test induces xfs_repair to fail while upgrading a filesystem to
have the inobtcount feature, and then restarts xfs_repair to finish the
upgrade.  When the second xfs_repair run starts, it will find that the
primary super has NEEDSREPAIR set, along with whatever new feature that
we were trying to add to the filesystem.

From there, repair completes the upgrade in much the same manner as the
first repair run would have, with one big exception -- it forgets to set
features_changed to trigger rewriting of the secondary supers at the end
of repair.  This results in discrepancies between the supers:

	egrep '(features_ro_compat|features_incompat)'
features_ro_compat = 0xd
features_incompat = 0xb
features_ro_compat = 0x5
features_incompat = 0xb

Curiously, re-running xfs_repair will not trigger any warnings about the
featureset mismatch between the primary and secondary supers.  xfs_scrub
immediately notices, which is what causes xfs/158 to fail.

This discrepancy doesn't happen when the upgrade completes successfully
in a single repair run, so we need to teach repair to rewrite the
secondaries at the end of repair any time needsrepair was set.
