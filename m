It was written specifically for a NFS/CIFS fileserver appliance
product and Samba needed filesystem-side CI to be able to perform
even vaguely well on industry-standard fileserver benchmarketing
workloads that were all the rage at the time.

Because of the inherent problems with CI and UTF-8 encoding, etc, it
was decided that Samba would be configured to export latin1
encodings as that covered >90% of the target markets for the
product. Hence the "ascii-ci" casefolding code could be encoded into
the XFS directory operations and remove all the overhead of
casefolding from Samba.

In various "important" directory benchmarketing workloads, ascii-ci
resulted in speedups of 100-1000x. These were competitive results
comapred to the netapp/bluearc/etc appliances of the time in the
same cost bracket.  Essentially, it was a special case solution to
meet a specific product requirement and was never intended to be
used outside that specific controlled environment.

Realistically, this is the one major downside of "upstream first"
development principle.  i.e. when the vendor product that required
a specific feature is long gone, upstream still has to support that
functionality even though there may be no users of it remaining
and/or no good reason for it continuing to exist.

I'd suggest that after this is fixed we deprecate ascii-ci and make
it go away at the same time v4 filesystems go away. It was, after
all, a feature written for v4 filesystems....

Cheers,

Dave.
