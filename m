The distinction between the three (XXXi, XXXd, XXX_intent) wasn't
entirely clear to me either, years ago.  TBH, it didn't fully come into
focus for me until 2020 when I wrote the log-assisted extent swapping
code, since it was the first piece of code I touched where deferred work
could happen without log items.

Here's my current understanding of how the three pieces fit together.
You probably already know this, but I'll post it all here for everyone
else following along at home:

The deferred work item (aka that huge state machine coded up in
xfs_attr_set_iter) is a high level filesystem operation that does a
bunch of complex work using a series of smaller transactions.  The big
operation needs to store a bunch of in-memory state as it progresses
through the operation; this is what's stored in xfs_XXX_intent.

(If I had to do it all over again, I'd probably have named this
differently, such as xfs_rmap_deferred instead of xfs_rmap_intent; and
the slab caches xfs_rmap_deferred_cache instead of
xfs_rmap_intent_cache.)

If a deferred work item wants to support restarting an operation after a
crash, it needs to log a "log intent item" to the first transaction
where it commits to doing an operation.  This is what log recovery picks
up in those _commit_pass2 functions, so the log intent item must contain
whatever breadcrumbs are needed to figure out where in the complex
operation was the filesystem when it crashed.

Each time the deferred work item makes some progress, it should log a
"log intent done item" to the same transaction in which it made
progress, which serves as a tombstone for the recovered intent item.  If
there's more work to be done, the deferred work item must also log a new
"log intent item" reflecting the updated internal deferred work state.

The log intent items are usually named xfs_XXXi_log_item, and the log
intent done items are usually named xfs_XXXd_log_item.  The caches are
named xfs_XXXi_cache and xfs_XXXd_cache.

Note: Deferred work items are /not/ required to use the log to track
progress.  This can happen if the user-visible effects of the operation
are idempotent (defragmenting with fsr) or if the operations are staged
in such an order that inconsistency is not possible (xattr INCOMPLETE
flags).

Yeah.  The naming is weird.  Maybe some day I'll do a treewide change
and fix all this stuff, since "item" is a bit vague to me and confusable
with log items... and an "item/intent" doesn't even necessarily have an
associated log item!  The thing is, renaming like that makes rebasing
developer trees that much harder, which is why I haven't done that.

Thanks!

Hmm.  I'll ponder that. :)
