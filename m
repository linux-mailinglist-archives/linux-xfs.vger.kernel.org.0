Frankly I don't really see the value in crc32selftest when cross
compiling -- sure, the crc32c code works correctly on the build host,
but that proves nothing about the (cross-)built binaries that end up in
the package.

The selftest code is modular enough that it's included in xfs_io and it
seems to run in under 500us even on my ancient raspberry pi 3b+
downclocked to 600mhz.  Why don't we just add it to mkfs and repair?
Those tools shouldn't be run all that frequently, and now we'll know
immediately if crc32c is broken on a user's system.

Then we don't need the build-time selftest at all.
