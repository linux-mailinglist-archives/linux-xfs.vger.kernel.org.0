It doesn't relate to the cleanup below at all.  I put a comment there to
explain why this verifier function doesn't check the rextsize alignment
of the hint.  In other words, it's a comment describing a gap in a
validation function and why we can't remove the gap here but have to
sprinkle mitigations everywhere else.

Earlier iterations of this patch simply fixed the verifier and allowed
existing filesystems to fail.  Brian and I weren't totally comfortable
with introducing a breaking change like that even though the
consequences of the bad hint actually propagating into a realtime file
are immediate filesystem corruption shutdowns, so this iteration
mitigates the propagation issue by fixing directories when they get
rewritten and preventing propagation of bad hints into new files.

I don't want to introduce a new feature/inode flag just to say
"corrected rt extent size hint" since having an extent size hint set on
a filesystem with a realtime extent size larger than 1 fsb on a
filesystem with a realtime volume configured at all is a vanishingly
rare condition.

Granted, we could decide to introduce the breaking verifier change and
say "fmeh to this corner case, if you did that you're screwed anyway",
but I think I want a few more ACKs on /that/ strategy before I do that.

Yes.  As I mentioned above, the comment documents code that isn't there
and cannot be added.

Ok.

Fixed, though Linus said to stop caring about code that goes slightly
over.

Ok fine I'll do this bugfix properly and turn the cleanups into new
separate patches and add all three to the 15+ cleanup patches I didn't
manage to get merged last cycle.
