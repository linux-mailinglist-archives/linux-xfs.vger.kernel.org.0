Personally, I wouldn't want to give up doing development work
altogether.=A0I don't mind doing some maintainership duties, and helping
out other maintainers where I can, but maintainership takes a lot more
time than most people realize. You're sort of obligated to review
everything that comes across your plate.

I know Trond and Anna have been successful alternating the handling of
pull requests and linux-next. I think it makes a lot of sense to have
maintainership teams, at least for larger subsystems. We sort of have
them informally now, but maybe we should be aiming to have a group of
people who are all nominally maintainers on larger subsystems. They can
then rotate between themselves on some schedule (every year? or every 5
releases? Whatever works...).

That provides some extra incentive for other team members to help out
with reviews, and it may make it simpler for someone else to step in
when the current maintainer needs to step away.

It does rely on a high degree of trust between team members, but most of
us seem to get along.
