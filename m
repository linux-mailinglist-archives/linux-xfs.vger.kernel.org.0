Yep.  Freezes should be fairly infrequent, which means we'd be imposing
a pretty high penalty on every read ever just for the sake of a
relatively rare operation.

That sounds like a reasonable place to start.  At some point after the
merge window closes I'm going to send some patches to -fsdevel to fix
the problem that sync_filesystem ignores the ->sync_fs() return value,
but think the conflicts should not be insurmountable.

I'm a bit partial to /trying/ to recycle inactive inodes because (a)
it's less tangling with -fsdevel for you and (b) inode scans in the
online repair patchset got a little weird once xfs_iget lost the ability
to recycle _NEEDS_INACTIVE inodes...

OTOH I tried to figure out how to deal with the lockless list that those
inodes are put on, and I couldn't figure out how to get them off the
list safely, so that might be a dead end.  If you have any ideas I'm all
ears. :)
