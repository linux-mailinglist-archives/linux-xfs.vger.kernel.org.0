Put it in another patchset, please.

Everyone, can we please get out of the habit of asking for extra
cleanups to be done as a condition for getting a change
merged just because the patchset makes a change to slightly crufty
but perfectly working code?

Cleaning up this code is not necessary for this patchset to achieve
it's goals or make forwards progress. Yes, the code that locking is
being added to is slightly crusty, but it is not broken nor is
showing up on profiles as being a performance, scalability or memory
usage limiting factor. Changing the algorithm of this code is
therefore unnecessary to acheive the goals of this patchset.

IOWs, put this aside this cleanup as future work on a rainy day
when we have fixed all the bigger scalability problems and have
nothing better to do.

"If it ain't broke, don't fix it."

Cheers,

Dave.
