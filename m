I also failed to reproduce it on another VM, but it reproduces reliably
on this system. That's why I thought we'd better use this opportunity.
This system has lots of RAM and disk to spare so I have no problem
running this test in a VM in parallel to my work.

It is not actually my system, it's a system that Luis has setup for
stable XFS testing and gave me access to, so if the need arises
you could get direct access to the system, but for now, I have no
problem running the test for you.

I tested it on top of 5.10.109 + these 5 patches:
https://github.com/amir73il/linux/commits/xfs-5.10.y-1

I can test it in isolation if you like. Let me know if there are
other forensics that you would like me to collect.

Thanks,
Amir.
