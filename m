Ok, I thought that stuff was actually merged so I'm kind of confused at
this point. :P

It's also easier to review code that's already been reviewed from the
kernel and is being carted over for reuse, so I think it makes sense to
keep things in sync for that reason as well.

Re: above. I thought that stuff was merged and the approach was to move
the code over for reuse between scrub/xfs_repair. In any event, I think
what would facilitate subsequent reviews is some explicit separation
between patches for shared code and repair-specific code as well as some
references in the cover letter for the source of the former if those
bits haven't landed in the kernel yet...
