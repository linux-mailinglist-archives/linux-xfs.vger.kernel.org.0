From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

Certain types of filesystem metadata can only be checked by scanning
every file in the entire filesystem.  Specific examples of this include
quota counts, file link counts, and reverse mappings of file extents.
Directory and parent pointer reconstruction may also fall into this
category.  File scanning is much trickier than scanning AG metadata
because we have to take inode locks in the same order as the rest of
[VX]FS, we can't be holding buffer locks when we do that, and scanning
the whole filesystem takes time.

Earlier versions of the online repair patchset relied heavily on
fsfreeze as a means to quiesce the filesystem so that we could take
locks in the proper order without worrying about concurrent updates from
other writers.  Reviewers of those patches opined that freezing the
entire fs to check and repair something was not sufficiently better than
unmounting to run fsck offline.  I don't agree with that 100%, but the
message was clear: find a way to repair things that minimizes the
quiet period where nobody can write to the filesystem.

Generally, building btree indexes online can be split into two phases: a
collection phase where we compute the records that will be put into the
new btree; and a construction phase, where we construct the physical
btree blocks and persist them.  While it's simple to hold resource locks
for the entirety of the two phases to ensure that the new index is
consistent with the rest of the system, we don't need to hold resource
locks during the collection phase if we have a means to receive live
updates of other work going on elsewhere in the system.

The goal of this patch, then, is to enable online fsck to learn about
metadata updates going on in other threads while it constructs a shadow
copy of the metadata records to verify or correct the real metadata.  To
minimize the overhead when online fsck isn't running, we use srcu
notifiers because they prioritize fast access to the notifier call chain
(particularly when the chain is empty) at a cost to configuring
notifiers.  Online fsck should be relatively infrequent, so this is
acceptable.

The intended usage model is fairly simple.  Code that modifies a
metadata structure of interest should declare a xfs_hook_chain structure
in some well defined place, and call xfs_hook_call whenever an update
happens.  Online fsck code should define a struct notifier_block and use
xfs_hook_add to attach the block to the chain, along with a function to
be called.  This function should synchronize with the fsck scanner to
update whatever in-memory data the scanner is collecting.  When
finished, xfs_hook_del removes the notifier from the list and waits for
them all to complete.

On the author's computer, calling an empty srcu notifier chain was
observed to have an overhead averaging ~40ns with a maximum of 60ns.
Adding a no-op notifier function increased the average to ~58ns and
66ns.  When the quotacheck live update notifier is attached, the average
increases to ~322ns with a max of 372ns to update scrub's in-memory
observation data, assuming no lock contention.

With jump labels enabled, calls to empty srcu notifier chains are elided
from the call sites when there are no hooks registered, which means that
the overhead is 0.36ns when fsck is not running.  For compilers that do
not support jump labels (all major architectures do), the overhead of a
no-op notifier call is less bad (on a many-cpu system) than the atomic
counter ops, so we make the hook switch itself a nop.

Note: This new code is also split out as a separate patch from its
initial user so that the author can move patches around his tree with
ease.
