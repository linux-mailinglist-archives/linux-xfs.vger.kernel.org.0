...and the problem with removing the flush_workqueue() calls from
background reclaim is that it doesn't know that xfs will try to push
things out of memory in a different thread, because there's no way to
tell it that we're separately working on freeing XXX bytes?

Ah, yep.  XFS has no way to convey this to background reclaim, and
reclaim might not even be able to make much use of that information,
because anyone supplying it could be (a) wrong or (b) unable to free the
objects within whatever timeframe reclaim needs.  Thinking ahead, even
if XFS could give the shrinker an ETA, reclaim would still end up
waiting.  I suppose it might be nice for reclaim to trigger multiple
asynchronous freeings and wait on all of them, but that just shifts the
question to "how does xfs know how long it'll take?" and "how many more
cleverness beans will it take for support to figure out the system has
wedged itself in this weird state?"

Right now we at least get a nice compact stack trace when xfs stalls
background reclaim.

Ah, ok.  I'll drop this then.
