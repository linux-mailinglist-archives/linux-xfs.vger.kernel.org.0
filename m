So we have a directory inode that is empty and unlinked but held
open, with a back pointer to an invalid inode number? Which can
never be followed, because the directory has been unlinked.

Can't this be handled in the inode verifier? This seems to me to
be a pretty clear cut case where the ".." back pointer should
always be considered invalid (because the parent dir has no
existence guarantee once the child has been removed from it), not
just in the situation where the filesystem has been shrunk...

Cheers,

Dave.
