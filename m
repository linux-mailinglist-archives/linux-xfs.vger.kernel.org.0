Perhaps ctx size isn't a sufficient baseline by itself. That said, log
stripe unit is still fixed and afaict centralized to the base unit res
calculation of the CIL ctx and regular transaction tickets. So I'm not
convinced we couldn't come up with something useful on the push side
that factors lsunit into the metric. It doesn't have to be perfect, just
something conservative enough to catch consuming reservation beyond
expected worst case conditions without causing false positives.

Re: your followups, I'll put more thought into it when the percpu
algorithm is more settled..

Yeah, that works for me.

Ah, right. Note that's not the last place we take from ->t_curr_res in
the xlog_write() path. xlog_state_get_iclog_space() steals a bit as well
if we're at the top of an iclog so it might be worth bolstering that
check.
