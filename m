Sure, we might, but let's not delay this cleanup, since these are the
last two pieces that I need to get merged before I can send out deferred
inode inactivation for review.  Deferred inode inactivation adds yet
another button that we can push to reclaim free space when something hits
EDQUOT/ENOSPC.

FWIW I did start down the path of building a better interface last week,
but quickly became mired in (1) how do we allocate rt quota with a new
interface and (2) do we care?  And then I started looking at what rt
allocations do wrt quota and decided that fixing that (or even removing
it) would be an entire patchset.

Hence I'm trying to constrain this patchset to updating the existing
callsites to do the scan+retry, and no more.

Making a worst case reservation and backing off creates more ways for
things to fail unnecessarily.

For a remap operation, the worst case is if the source file range has an
allocated mapping and the destination file range is a hole, because we
have to increment quota by the size of that allocated mapping.  If we
run out of quota we'll have to flush the fs and try again.  If we fail
the quota reservation a second time, the whole operation fails.

This is not good behavior for all the other cases -- if both mappings
are holes or both allocated, we just failed an operation that would have
made no net change to the quota allocations.  If the source file range
is a hole and the destination range is allocated, we actually would have
/decreased/ the quota usage, but instead we fail with EDQUOT.

Right now the remap code handles those cases just fine, at a cost of
open coded logic.

If you format a filesystem with realtime and mount it with -oquota, xfs
will ignore the 'quota' mount option completely.  Some code exists to
do rt quota accounting (xfs_alloc_file_space and xfs_iomap_write_direct
are examples) but since we never allow rt+quota, the code coverage on
that is 0%.

I've also noticed that those functions seem to have this odd behavior
where for rt files, they'll reserve quota for the allocated blocks
themselves but not the bmbt blocks; but for regular files, they reserve
quota for both the allocated blocks and the bmbt blocks.  The quota code
makes various allowances for transactions that try to commit quota count
updates but have zero quota reservation attached to the transaction,
which I /think/ could have been an attempt to work around that quirk.

I also just noticed that xfs_bmapi_reserve_delalloc only works with
non-rt files.  I guess that's fine since rt files don't use the delalloc
mechanism anyway (and I think the  reason they don't is that xfs can't
currently do write-around to handle rextsize>1 filesystems) but that's
another mess to sort.

(FWIW I'm slowly working through all those rt issues as part of maturing
the rt reflink patchset, but that's at the far end of my dev tree...)
