I would have thought that should be able to do more than the 20 IOPS
the raid6 above will do on random 4kB writes.... :)

Yup, the realtime device is a pure data device, so all it's metadata
is held externally to the device (i.e. it is held in the "data
device", not the RT device). IOWs, it's a completely separate
filesystem implementation within XFS, and so requires independent
functional extensions to support reflink + rmap...

Yes, it is possible, but the current reflink implementation is based
on allocation group internal structures (rmap is the same), and the
realtime device doesn't have these. Hence there are new metadata
structures that need to be added (refcount btrees rooted in inodes,
not fixed location AG headers) and a bunch of new supporting code to
be written. Largely Darrick has done this already, it's just a
problem of review bandwidth and validation time:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/djwong/xfs-linux.git/log/?h=realtime-reflink-extsize

(which also includes realtime rmap support, a whole new internal
metadata inode directory to index all the new inode btrees for the
rt device, etc)

It's a pretty large chunk of shiny new code....

Cheers,

Dave.
