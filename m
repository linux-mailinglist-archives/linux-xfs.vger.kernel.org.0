Ah, I see, you're asking why don't I make xfs_inode_walk responsible for
deciding what to do about EAGAIN, instead of open-coding that in the
->execute function.  That would be a nice cleanup since the walk
function already has special casing for EFSCORRUPTED.

If I read you correctly, the relevant part of xfs_inode_walk becomes:

	error = execute(batch[i]...);
	xfs_irele(batch[i]);
	if (error == -EAGAIN) {
		if (args->flags & EOF_SYNC)
			skipped++;
		continue;
	}

and the relevant part of xfs_inode_free_eofblocks becomes:

	if (!xfs_ilock_nowait(ip, XFS_IOLOCK_EXCL))
		return -EAGAIN;

I think that would work, and afaict it won't cause any serious problems
with the deferred inactivation series.
