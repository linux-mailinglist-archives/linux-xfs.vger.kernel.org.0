It's still an extra pair of atomic operation per xfs_perag_get/put()
call pairs. pag_inactive being true is the slow/rare path, so we
should be trying to keep the overhead of detecting that path out of
all our fast paths...

Indeed, xfs_perag_get() already shows up on profiles because of the
number of calls we make to it, so adding an extra atomic operation
for this operation is going to be noticable in terms of CPU usage,
if nothing else.

Maybe so, but that's exactly what this patch is addressing - it's
adding a way to detect that perag has "gone away"i and should not be
referenced any more.

It wasn't until I saw this patch that I realised that there is a way
that we can, in fact, safely handle perags being freed by ensuring
that the RCU lookup fails for these "active" references....

The way I described should work just fine - nobody should be
accessing the per-ag without a reference gained through a lookup in
some way.  Buffers carry a passive reference, because the per-ag
teardown will do the teardown of those references before the perag
is freed.  Everything else carries an active reference and so
teardown cannot begin until all active references go away.

I think converting this patchset to active/passive references ias
I've described solves the problem entirely - there's no "evolving"
needed as we can solve it with this one structural change...

Cheers,

Dave.
