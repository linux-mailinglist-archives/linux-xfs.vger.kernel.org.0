Ok, so we can just use xlog_wait_on_iclog() here. I didn't look too
closely at the implementation of that function, just took the
comment above it at face value that it only waited for an iclog to
hit the disk.

We actually have two different iclog IO completion wait points - one
to wait for an iclog to hit the disk, and one to wait for hit the
disk and run completion callbacks. i.e. one is not ordered against
other iclogs and the other is strictly ordered.

The ordered version runs completion callbacks before waking waiters
thereby guaranteeing all previous iclog have been completed before
completing the current iclog and waking waiters.

The CIL code needs the latter, so yes, this can be simplified down
to a single xlog_wait_on_iclog(commit_iclog->ic_prev); call from the
CIL.

Cheers,

Dave.
