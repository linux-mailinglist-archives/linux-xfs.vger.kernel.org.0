Ok. I added it to my branch.
Note that 5.10.y was not getting any xfs fixes for 2 years, so for now I am
working my way up from v5.11 and not expediting any fixes, because if
downstream users waited for 2 years, they can wait a few more weeks.

My list of candidates was extracted at time of 5.18-rc1 and I intentionally
wanted to let the 5.18 patches soak before I consider them.
I will get to the 5.18 release when I am done posting fixes up to 5.17.

Oy :)

I'll be sure to fix that when I post to stable.

Thanks,
Amir.
