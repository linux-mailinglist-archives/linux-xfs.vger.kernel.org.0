I see what you mean, but from another POV, you'd be basing a PR on top of one
series of patches, not on top of everything.

Today, what we have, is a relatively stable for-next branch, where we just
really rebase when something goes wrong, so, usually, when I push things into
for-next, I've had it tested for a big while.

Per my conversations off-list (specially with hch), is that this shouldn't be
the purpose at all of for-next, but a testing branch where (almost anything) can
go wrong, within reason of course. Please correct me if I'm wrong here.

At the same time, I wish we have a branch that everybody can work with, which
contains 'everything' staged, ready to go, so I'd do all the merge between
current and next release myself into such branch. I think having a branch ready
for people to work with is a maintainer's job, and people shouldn't be bothered
by trying to figure out which branch they should use to base their patches on
top.

I'm hoping to use the master's branch for that if nobody has any objection.
