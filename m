Individual items might shrink, but the overall transaction should
grow. Think of a extent to btree conversion of an inode fork. THe
data in the inode fork decreases from a list of extents to a btree
root block pointer, so the inode item shrinks. But then we add a new
btree root block that contains all the extents + the btree block
header, and it gets rounded up to ithe 128 byte buffer logging chunk
size.

IOWs, while the inode item has decreased in size, the overall
space consumed by the transaction has gone up and so the CIL ctx
used_space should increase. Hence we can't just look at individual
log items and whether they have decreased in size - we have to look
at all the items in the transaction to understand how the space used
in that transaction has changed. i.e. it's the aggregation of all
items in the transaction that matter here, not so much the
individual items.

Yes, there may be situations where it decreases. It may be this is
fine, but the assumption *I've made* in lots of the CIL push code is
that ctx->used_space rarely, if ever, will go backwards.

e.g. we run the first transaction into the CIL, it steals the sapce
needed for the cil checkpoint headers for the transaciton. Then if
the space returned by the item formatting is negative (because it is
in the AIL and being relogged), the CIL checkpoint now doesn't have
the space reserved it needs to run a checkpoint. That transaction is
a sync transaction, so it forces the log, and now we push the CIL
without sufficient reservation to write out the log headers and the
items we just formatted....

So, yeah, shrinking transaction space usage definitely violates some
of the assumptions the code makes about how relogging works. It's
entirely possible the assumptions I've made are not entirely correct
in some corner cases - those particular cases are what we need to
ferret out here, and then decide if they are correct or not and deal
with it from there...

Cheers,

Dave.
