xfs_inactive doesn't take the iolock because (evidently) at some point
there were lockdep complaints about taking it in reclaim context.  By
the time the inode reaches inactivation context, there can't be any
other users of it anyway -- the last caller dropped its reference, we
tore down the VFS inode, and anyone who wants to resuscitate the inode
will wait in xfs_iget for us to finish.
