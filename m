/me regrets that he is frequently failing to clear enough space out of
his schedule to respond to all of these adequately.  But here goes,
random thoughts at 23:23. :/

Well, we've killed off old features before... v1 inodes, v2 directories,
etc.  So clearly this can be done, given enough preparation time.

And we probably ought to do it, before we start to resemble the ext4
quota nightmare.

It probably ought to print a warning...

That said, way back when we were arguing with the syzbot people, one of
us suggested that we hide V4 behind a CONFIG_XFS_DEPRECATED=y option, so
that people who want to harden their kernel against the unfixable
structural problems in the V4 format could effectively lose V4 support
early.  Maybe we should add that for a few years?

That probably depends a lot on how much our respective employers want to
keep those old XFSes going.  Some of our customers are about ready to
certify that they can support their distro defaults changing from ext3
to XFS v4, but those folks have support contracts that won't terminate
until whenever the so^Hun goes out.
