I'll take a 10% win. :)

Huh.  So now that I'm more awake, I noticed that you didn't patch
xfs_extfree_item.c to free the shadow buffers because the
xfs_ef[id]_item_free functions already have code to free the shadow
buffer.  git blame says that was added in:

b1c5ebb21301 ("xfs: allocate log vector buffers outside CIL context lock")

This commit was added in 4.8-rc1, and just prior to merging the rmap
patches.

When do log intent items get shadow buffers, since they should only be
committed once?  Looking at that old commit, I think what's going on is
that we preallocate the shadow buffers for every log item at commit time
to avoid a memory allocation when we have the ctx lock, so now it's
necessary for all log intent items to free them?

Does that mean RUI/CUI/BUI log items could have been leaking shadow
buffers since the beginning, and we just haven't noticed because the CIL
has freed them for us?  Which means that the changes to xfs_*_item.c
could, in theory, be a separate patch that fixes a theoretical memory
leak?

(I'm not asking for you to separate the changes; I'm checking my
understanding of something that caused me to go "Eh???" on first
reading.)

Yes please, since xlog_cil_insert_items already adjusts
tp->t_ticket->t_curr_res and it would seem to make more sense to keep
all those adjustments together.
