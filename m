Not exactly. What I was thinking was something like this:

xfs_trans_bhold() should do:

	bip->bli_flags |= XFS_BLI_HOLD;
	atomic_inc(&bip->bli_refcount);

xfs_trans_bhold_release() should do:

	bip->bli_flags &= ~XFS_BLI_HOLD;
	atomic_dec(&bip->bli_refcount);

xfs_trans_brelse() shoudl do:

	if (bip->bli_flags & XFS_BLI_HOLD) {
		bip->bli_flags &= ~XFS_BLI_HOLD;
		atomic_dec(&bip->bli_refcount);
	}

and xfs_buf_item_release() should do:

	if (hold) {
		/* Release the hold ref but not the rolling transaction ref */
		bip->bli_flags &= ~XFS_BLI_HOLD;
		atomic_dec(&bip->bli_refcount);
		return;
	}
	released = xfs_buf_item_put(bip);
	if (stale && !released)
		return;

Then _xfs_trans_bjoin() remains unchanged, as we don't remove the
BLI from the held clean buffer as there is still a reference to it.
The new transaction we rejoin the buffer to will take that
reference.

Cheers,

Dave.
