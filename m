Thank you for your detailed answer, it was great, I understand
what you mean.

The intent item stays in the AIL until the done item is committed,
which prevents the tail lsn from moving forward. After the transaction
is alloced in ->iop_recover(), we don't need to stop tail lsn from
moving forward because there is no other thread committing the
transaction at this point, the intent item will not be overwritten
until the done intent is written to the log, so we can just remove
the intent item from the AIL.

I think we can remove the intent item from the AIL as soon as the
done item is created, since the reference count has already been
passed to the done item. Eventually the problem can be fixed.

This is my understanding.

Thanks
Long Li
