That's the best of both worlds.

No, my reading comprehension just sucks :)  And of course the way
it's written isn't very helpful either.

Yeah, just stick to SZ_1M.

How do you create a larger bio if you only have a single bio available?

Ooooh.  Yes, that will screw up badly when using PI.

No.  max_sectors_kb is kida stupid.  I think a sensible default and
a tunable is a better choice here at least for now.

Yeah.  But seriously, if the MM is pretty good and is getting better
at finding large allocations.  We need to start relying on that.

No, leave all that splitting to the block layer.  max_segments is
an implementation detail.
