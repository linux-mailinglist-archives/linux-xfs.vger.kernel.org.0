That looks like a bug in whatever distro you are using - it works
as it should here on a recent debian unstable userspace.

Note, however, that ps will show all processes in both the parent
and the child namespace the shell is running on because the contents
of /proc are the same for both.

However, because we are also using private mount namespaces for the
check process, pid_namespaces(7) tells us:

/proc and PID namespaces

       A /proc filesystem shows (in the /proc/pid directories) only
       processes visible in the PID namespace of the process that
       performed the mount, even if the /proc filesystem is viewed
       from processes in other namespaces.

       After creating a new PID namespace, it is useful for the
       child to change its root directory and mount a new procfs
       instance at /proc so that tools  such  as  ps(1) work
>>>    correctly.  If a new mount namespace is simultaneously
>>>    created by including CLONE_NEWNS in the flags argument of
>>>    clone(2) or unshare(2), then it isn't necessary to change the
>>>    root directory: a new procfs instance can be mounted directly
>>>    over /proc.

       From a shell, the command to mount /proc is:

           $ mount -t proc proc /proc

       Calling readlink(2) on the path /proc/self yields the process
       ID of the caller in the PID namespace of the procfs mount
       (i.e., the PID name‐ space of the process that mounted the
       procfs).  This can be useful for introspection purposes, when
       a process wants to discover its  PID  in other namespaces.

This appears to give us an environment that only shows the processes
within the current PID namespace:

$ sudo src/nsexec -p -m bash
# mount -t proc proc /proc
# ps waux
USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root           1  0.0  0.0   7384  3744 pts/1    S    11:55   0:00 bash
root          72  0.0  0.0   8300  3736 pts/1    R+   12:04   0:00 ps waux
# pstree -N pid
[4026538173]
bash───pstree
#

Yup, there we go - we have full PID isolation for this shell.

OK, I suspect this is a better way to proceed for check-parallel than
to need session IDs for individual tests and wrappers for
pgrep/pkill/pidwait. Let me see what breaks when I use this.....

-Dave.
