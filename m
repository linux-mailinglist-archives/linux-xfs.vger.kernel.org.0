[echoing what we just discussed on irc]

repair will print the above warning, and then it'll try to find either a
backup sb with a sunit value that makes the computation work, or guess
at sunit values until it finds one that makes the computation work.  If
it finds a reasonable sunit value it'll change it back to that.

If the user mounts an old kernel with the same bad sunit value, the
kernel will set it back to the bad value and we wash, rinse, and repeat.

If the user mounts a new kernel with the same bad sunit value, it'll
decline to change the sunit value.

If the user runs the bad-sunit fs against an old xfs_repair it will
descend into madness nuking the root directory, which is why we're
trying to nudge ourselves away from the bad value.

Yes.
