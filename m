Depends. The prototype I did allowed concurrent remaps to run on
different ranges of the file. The extent manipulations were still
internally serialised by the ILOCK so the concurrent modifications
were still serialised. Hence things like block mapping lookups for
read IO still serialised. (And hence my interest in lockless btrees
for the extent list so read IO wouldn't need to take the ILOCK at
all.)

However, if you want to remap the entire file, we've still got to
start with locking the entire file range and draining IO and writing
back all dirty data. So cloning a file is still a complete
serialisation event with range locking, but we can optimise away
some of the tail latencies by unlocking ranges remapped range by
remapped range...

Cheers,

Dave.
