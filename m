I don't think you should ever declare for-next as a "stable" branch
to base new work on, for the same reason that linux-next isn't
stable. i.e. for-next is a "work in progress" branch that, eventually,
becomes the branch that is merged upstream. It's not actually
something developers can rely on being "stable" until it is tagged
for upstream merge and a pull-request issued.

Really, for-next is the intergration branch - it's first place where
we get wider coverage of the development code via linux-next. There
is -always- a chance that someone using linux-next is going to find
a problem that requires a rebase of the for-next branch to fix, and
so the for-next branch really isn't "stable".

If we need public stable branches for cross-dev development, they
need to be published in their own branch as an explicitly stable
branch. That stable branch can then be merged into dev trees and
for-next like any other stable branch and when those dev branches
are merged into the one tree from multiple sources git will
recognise this and merge them cleanly.

IOWs, for-next is for shaking out problems found during integration
and wider testing, not for commit stability....

The base of topic branch should be a Linus release at or before
(older) the base commit the xfs fixes branch is based off.
Otherwise when the topic branch is merged into the for-next tree, it
will also pull all the commits from the upstream branch that the
for-next tree doesn't have.

IOWs, if the XFS fixes branch is based on 5.13-rc2, then all pull
requests need to be based on either the fixes branch or at or
something earlier than xfs/master. If you base the pull req on
5.13-rc3, then merging the topic branch into for-next will also move
for-next forward to 5.13-rc3. This makes a mess of the tree history,
and Linus will complain about the mess when he sees it...

In case I haven't already made it clear, I think the master branch
should only get updated once per release cycle, some time shortly
after the merge window closes.  Ideally this happens around -rc2
so the base is somewhat stable.

/me does a double take

When did xfs/master move forward to 5.13-rc4?

IMO, it should not change at all during a cycle. Having to update
the -fixes branch late in the cycle does not need rebasing the
master branch or the fixes branch. It just means it needs to be
merged into the for-next branch again after the new fix is appended
to it.

Moving the master branch forwards to pick up all the fixes just
leads to downstream problems when people are managing multiple
branches locally. i.e. master branch stability isn't about what is
convenient for building for-next, but about providing a stable base
for all developers that are using the tree to build pull requests.

IOWs, I do not want to be using -rc2 for one set of topic branches,
and then another branch I set up for merge a week later to be based
on -rc4 even though I've used xfs/master as the base for all of
them.  That results in lots of local merge noise and difficultly in
getting diffs between branches. This also causes problems with
explicitly stable branches if they end up being based off different
commits to the rest of the trees.

So unless there's a compelling reason, I don't think the master
branch should move more than once per dev cycle. Everyone should be
using the same base for their pull requests so they can pull each
other's work without getting base kernel revision noise in the
merges...

Hardly - that's how I've worked for over a decade :P

Right, but my point is that where that commit comes from isn't
obvious just by looking at the pull request. I mean, can you tell me
what branch/base kernel is the pull request based on just from the
commit ID and name?

If you look at the pull-reqs I sent you, they say:

The following changes since commit d07f6ca923ea0927a1024dfccafc5b53b61cfecc:

  Linux 5.13-rc2 (2021-05-16 15:27:44 -0700)

are available in the Git repository at:
....

And that is immediately obvious what the pull-req is based on.
That's what xfs/master /was/ based on when I built the topic
branches. Using a common, known base for building branches makes
things easier for everyone....

Cheers,

Dave.
