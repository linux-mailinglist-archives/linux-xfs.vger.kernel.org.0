Yeah, I get the general idea/purpose of the throttling. What I'm probing
at here is whether a case like this is still handled effectively with
such a short scheduling delay. Presumably there is some window before
list size based throttling triggers for which the shrinker is expected
to cover, so that implies the shrinker historically is able to detect
and push populated queues and trigger throttling from the point it is
invoked (whether directly via repeated shrinker invocations or
indirectly via causing larger queue sizes is not clear to me).

The thing that stands out to me as a question wrt to this change is that
the trigger for shrinker induced throttling is the list size at the time
of the callback(s), and that goes from having a lifecycle associated
with the size-oriented scheduling algorithm to a time-based scheduling
lifecycle of one jiffy (also noting that the inodegc worker resets
shrinker_hits before it begins to process inodes). So with that in mind,
how reliable is this lowmem signal based on the list size back to the
tasks creating more work and memory pressure? Once a shrinker invocation
occurs, what are the odds that the callback is able to detect a
populated list and act accordingly?

These questions are somewhat rhetorical because this all seems rather
unpredictable when we consider varying resource availability. The
relevant question for this patch is probably just that somebody has
tested and confirmed that the shrinker hasn't been subtly or indirectly
broken in cases like the one you describe above (where perhaps we might
not have many shrinker callback opportunities to act on before OOM).

Ok.. so that implies we still need throttling, but I'm not sure what
"fancy percpu list design" refers to. If you have a good test case, I
think the interesting immediate question is: are those OOMs avoided with
this patch but the shrinker infrastructure still in place?

If not, then I wonder if something is going wonky there. If so, I'm
still a bit curious what the behavior looks like and whether it can be
simplified in light of this change, but that's certainly beyond the
scope of this patch.

Yeah small delay or yeah large delay?
