Thanks. Do you want me to post my v3 with the style and tag fixes or
have you already made those changes?

Oh, I see. Yeah, I think technically that would be more defensive logic.
We might be able to repurpose xfs_perag_next() into something more
generic that also covers the init case, but I'm not terribly concerned
with that type of misuse in the context of this patch (and not sure it
warrants the quirky logic if there are bigger changes pending with these
macros anyways).
