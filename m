Let me restate that:  you created a new XFS file system, but then tried
to reuse an existing log device for it?

How did you format the new file system?  XFS either expects and internal
log, or a log device?  For the above error it must have been formatted
with a different external log?  And then you just switched the mount
option to the log device of the previous file system?

If so that can't work, and I'm surprised you got so far.
