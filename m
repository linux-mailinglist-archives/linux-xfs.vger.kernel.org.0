I had something like that quite a long time ago.  Instead of the EAGAIN 
ping pong, we had a boolean that just sort of turned the transactions 
off in the delayed attrs path:

https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-xfs/msg18114.html

The trouble with this is that it creates one large transaction rather 
than breaking them up.  So while the new method is a lot more complex, 
it seemed to be the direction folks preferred.

Well, in an earlier discussion though we had come together with a plan 
of implementing the new feature through a series of sub sets.  First of 
which being pure refactor with no functional change.

https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-xfs/msg32035.html

I do try to keep the extended set up to date though.  Mostly for my own 
sanity and to make sure things are still on track for the long term 
goals we are aiming for.
