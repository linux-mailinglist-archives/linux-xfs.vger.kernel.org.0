Oh. I misunderstood.
I thought this wasn't a Fixes: situation.
I thought you pointed me to another related bug fix.

The value is in testing of LTS kernel.

For my backport work to be serious, I need to do serious testing.
Serious means running as many tests as I can and running the tests
on many configs and many times over.

When I first joined Luis in testing LTS baseline, CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG
was not enabled on the tested kernels.

I enabled it so I could get better test coverage for fstests that use
error injection and tests that check for asserts.

This helped me find a regression with one of the backported patches [1].

IOW, for LTS code to be in good quality, it needs to also have the
correct assertions.

For the same reason, I am also going to queue the following as stable
candidate:

756b1c343333 xfs: use current->journal_info for detecting transaction recursion

Because it has already proved to be helpful in detecting bugs on
our internal product tests.

Of course. I will defer sending this patch to stable and test
it along with the new fix.

Thanks!
Amir.
