Yes, it is, and that is the race condition is exactly what the next
patch in the series addresses. If the log tail moves after the data
device cache flush was issued before we started writing the
checkpoint to the iclogs, then we detect that when releasing the
commit iclog and set the XLOG_ICL_NEED_FLUSH flag on it. That will
then trigger this code to issue a data device cache flush....

IOWs, for external logs, the XLOG_ICL_NEED_FLUSH flag indicates that
both the data device and the log device need a cache flush, rather
than just the log device. I think it could be split into two flags,
but then my head explodes thinking about log forces and trying to
determine what type of flush is implied (and what flags we'd need to
set) when we return log_flushed = true....

Cheers,

Dave.
