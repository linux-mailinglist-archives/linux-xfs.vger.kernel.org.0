Sorry, I thought "you should just submit this in the simplified version"
was referring to the first patch I sent, as opposed to the cleanups
you're testing.

This isn't enough because this is only the last transaction in the
reflink sequence if we have to set the destination inode's size.  If
(say) we're reflinking a range inside EOF of two files that were already
sharing blocks, we still won't force the log out.

The other thing I thought of was simply invoking fsync after dropping
the iolock, but that seemed like more work than was strictly necessary
to land the reflink transactions on disk.
