I would not be opposed but there were many hurdles to that implementation.

What is the use case you are thinking of here?

The compromise of dropping caches was reached because we envisioned that many
users would simply want to chose the file mode when a file was created and
maintain that mode through the lifetime of the file.  To that end one can
simply create directories which have the desired dax mode and any files created
in that directory will inherit the dax mode immediately.  So there is no need
to switch the file mode directly as a normal user.

Would that work for your use case?
