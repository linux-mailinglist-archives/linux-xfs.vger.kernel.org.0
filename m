Yup, it's effectively the same thing because of the nature of the IO
failures (generated at submit time) and scheduler behaviour of
workqueues. THis means the IO completion that processes the error is
is queued to a workqueue on the same CPU. When thread 2 finishes
running (it hasn't seen an error yet) the completion work will get
get scheduled ahead of thread1 (cpu bound kernel task vs unbound
user task).  The completion work then runs the shutdown because it
saw a log IO error and because it's the commit record bio it runs
the journal checkpoint completion to abort all the items attached to
it and free the CIL context. Then thread 1 runs again.

The only difference between the two cases is which IO of the CIL
commit the request was failed on....

Cheers,

Dave.
