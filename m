The VFS does the assignment, see below.

The mount api callbacks are for use during setup and don't really
apply once that's done by the mount api.

Lets describe the life cycle of s_fs_info by going through the call
path from the xfs_get_tree() fs context operation.

At this point the context has been setup by .init_fs_context ( aka.
xfs_init_fs_context()), and fc->s_fs_info == mp and parameter parsing
has been done.

Then the .get_tree() method gets called (aka. fs_get_tree) and all
this does (now) is call get_tree_bdev() as Al requested.

Even though that's changed it still ends up calling similar VFS
functions to what it did before.

Now:
int get_tree_bdev(struct fs_context *fc,
                int (*fill_super)(struct super_block *,
                                  struct fs_context *))
{

skip ... (the usual stuff until we get to)

        fc->sb_flags |= SB_NOSEC;
        fc->sget_key = bdev;
        s = sget_fc(fc, test_bdev_super_fc, set_bdev_super_fc);
        mutex_unlock(&bdev->bd_fsfreeze_mutex);
        if (IS_ERR(s))
                return PTR_ERR(s);

        if (s->s_root) {
		snip ... (mount root already exists)
	} else {
                s->s_mode = mode;
                snprintf(s->s_id, sizeof(s->s_id), "%pg", bdev);
                sb_set_blocksize(s, block_size(bdev));
                error = fill_super(s, fc);
                if (error) {
                        deactivate_locked_super(s);
                        return error;
                }

                s->s_flags |= SB_ACTIVE;
                bdev->bd_super = s;
        }

        BUG_ON(fc->root);
        fc->root = dget(s->s_root);
	return 0;
}

This is to establish the order of what's done.

The thing we want to look at is the sget_fc() function.

struct super_block *sget_fc(struct fs_context *fc,
           int (*test)(struct super_block *, struct fs_context *),
           int (*set)(struct super_block *, struct fs_context *))
{
	snip ... (usual stuff that finds or allocates a super block)

        s->s_fs_info = fc->s_fs_info;
        err = set(s, fc);
        if (err) {
                s->s_fs_info = NULL;
                spin_unlock(&sb_lock);
                destroy_unused_super(s);
                return ERR_PTR(err);
        }
        fc->s_fs_info = NULL;

	snip ... (remaining setup stuff)

	return s;
}

This is where the s_fs_info changes from being the responsibility
of the fs context to being the responsibility of the super block.

And you can see that this is done before fill_super() is called.

Finally, fill_super() in xfs will do all the fs specific setup
and either return success or it will undo anything it has done
when returning an error, just as it did previously.

Specifically, it must set sb->s_fs_info == NULL on failure so
that when the VFS puts the super block xfs doesn't try and
release a whole bunch of stuff that wasn't setup. Consequently
mp must also be freed on error return from fill_super().

What I'm saying is that by the time fill_super() is called
everything is is a state where things need to be done pretty
much as though the mount api context isn't present, the only
thing that muddies the order of things is the calling of
.fc_free() that happens a bit later but isn't relevant to
this ordering of operations.

So I'm not sure there needs to be (or can be) changes to
the way s_fs_info is handled in the implementation.

We can go into more detail if it's needed, I am trying to
explain my motivations for doing what I've done, ;)

put_super() should continue to function the same way it does
now provided fill_super() does the right thing, which I'm
pretty sure it (the mount api version) does now .

xfs_fs_put_super() won't need to free mp if an error occurs,
s_fs_info needs to be NULL in that case as has always been the
case.

And realize xfs_fc_free() (aka. .fc_free()) is largely irrelevant
from the POV of xfs once we get to fill_super().
