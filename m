Sure I am fine with that as long as everyone else is.  Unless I hear 
otherwise, I will pull the error handling into the caller.

Yep, I checked this part, we do need the goto, or we do indeed get stuck 
in the wrong code path on re-entry.  In any case, will adjust the helper 
function mentioned above.  Thanks for the reviews!
