Nobody is questioning whether this is a worthwhile improvement. The
lockless shrinker instance iteration is definitely a good direction
to move in. The problem is the -process- that has been followed has
lead to a very sub-optimal result.

No, a revert doesn't mean we don't want the change; a revert means
the way the change was attempted has caused unexpected problems.
We need to go back to the drawing board and work out a better way to
do this.

No, I'm not mad at you.

If I'm annoyed at anyone, it's the senior mm developers and
maintainers that I'm annoyed at - not informing relevant parties
about modifications to shrinker infrastructure or implementations
has lead to regressions escaping out to user systems multiple times
in the past. 

Yet here we are again....

I don't think that fixes the problem, because the scope if much
wider than fs-devel:  look at all the different subsystems
that have a shrinker.

The whole kernel development process has always worked by the rule
that we're changing common infrastructure, all the subsystems using
that infrastructure need to be cc'd on the changes to the
infrastructure they are using. Just cc'ing -fsdevel isn't enough,
we've also got shrinkers in graphics driver infrastructure, *RCU*,
virtio, DM, bcache and various other subsystems.

And I'm betting most of them don't know that significant changes
have been made to how the shrinkers work....

Cheers,

Dave.
