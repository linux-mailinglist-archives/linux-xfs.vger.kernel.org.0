We don't know the size of the attribute that is being created, so
the attr size dependent parts of it can't be used.

Yes, there's a difference, but it's largely irrelevant as adding
the first attribute to a device format inode will reset the
forkoffset to the min via xfs_attr_shortform_bytesfit().

And if the attribute is larger than will fit in the default fork
offset space, but can fit the attr in shrotform by shrinking the
empty data fork space, xfs_attr_shortform_bytesfit() will do that as
well. IOWs, we only need to set a non-zero fork offset here and init
the ip->i_afp pointer - immediately setting an attribute on the
empty inode literal area will do the rest for the fork offset setup
for us...

Cheers,

Dave.
