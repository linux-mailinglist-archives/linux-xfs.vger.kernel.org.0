All of the above would make a nice commit log for an independent patch.
;) Note again that I wasn't suggesting the logic was incorrect...

This patch elevates a bit of code from effectively being an (ail) lock
avoidance optimization to essentially per-item filtering logic without
any explanation beyond facilitating future modifications. Independent of
whether it's correct, this is not purely a refactoring change IMO.

I find that hard to believe. This patch splits the buffer list into two
lists, processes the first one, immediately combines it with the second,
then processes the second which is no different from the single list
that was constructed by the original code. The only reasons I can see
for this kind of churn is either to address some kind of performance or
efficiency issue or if the lists are used for further changes. The
former is not a documented reason and there's no context for the latter
because it's apparently part of some future series.

TBH, I think this patch should probably be broken down into two or three
independent patches anyways. What's the issue with something like the
appended diff (on top of this patch) in the meantime? If the multiple
list logic is truly necessary, reintroduce it when it's used so it's
actually reviewable..
