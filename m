A future patchset will add the ability to make the per-AG health status
remember that we were forced to reclaim a sick inode:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/djwong/xfs-linux.git/log/?h=indirect-health-reporting

This series used to be the "fixes first" part of that code, but since it
directly intersects with the deferred inactivation changes, I moved it
up to try to fix the problem sooner than later.

Anyway, thanks for the review.
