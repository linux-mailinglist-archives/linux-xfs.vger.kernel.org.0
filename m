Just FWIW, I've been pretty much focusing on getting up to those one or
two patches and the preceding factoring leading up to it. I'm aware of
what's coming on top and have passed through it on (much) earlier
versions, but the release to release churn that results from the review
cycles is too much for me to keep up with in combination with other
things. To be clear, I'm certainly not _expecting_ to see a refresh of
the world so to speak on every post cycle based on feedback to the state
management code. (Of course there is nothing wrong with that if that's
your preference from a development perspective.)

One of the advantages of that IMO is that if everything leading up to
the introduction of state machine code is clean, isolated refactoring,
then ISTM those patches could roll into upstream as the series
progresses and minimize the snowball effect of the series overall.
That's one of the reasons I might harp a bit on some of the factoring
warts we might introduce, even if temporary and ultimately cleaned up by
the state management code, just because that makes it a little harder to
justify rolling things off the start of the series into upstream...
