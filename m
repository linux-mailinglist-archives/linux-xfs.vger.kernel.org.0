Hi everyone,

Now that I /think/ we're done with xfsprogs 6.13, here's a patchbomb
with all my code submissions for xfsprogs 6.14.  The first patchset
fixes some performance problems that Christoph observed with metadir
enabled and a very large number of rtgroups.

The second patchset is the usual libxfs resync; I'll only post it once
for archiving on the list.

The third and fourth patchsets implement all the userspace code needed
to handle reverse mapping and reflinks on the realtime volume.

The fifth patchset implements an "rdump" command for xfs_db.  This tool
has two intended users: support and recovery people who have a badly
damaged unmountable filesystem who want to try to extract as much of a
subdirectory as they can; and people who realize that they have an old
XFSv4 filesystem containing files they want, but kernel support for that
has been removed and finding/running an old kernel isn't possible or as
easy as running a program.

Nearly everything in here is unreviewed, but here's the list in case you
were wondering:
