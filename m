The original justification for using bhold here was to prevent the AIL
from trying to write the empty leaf block into the fs during the brief
time that we release the buffer lock.  The reason for /that/ was to
prevent recovery from tripping over the empty ondisk block.

The bhold didn't totally solve that problem (hence removing the !count
check entirely 3 years later) but it /has/ made things sufficiently more
complicated that the resident expert (allison) and two maintainers (you
and I) tripped over the bheld leaf buffer handling...

...so while I agree that this is a valid use of bhold, I also see that
the three people you'd most expect to wield the extra complexity have
not done it well, and decided to simplify the buffer usage back to a
more common use case in xfs.
