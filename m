With patch 11, larp=1 passes all but generic/642 - I screwed up a
state change that affects the larp=1 mode, so there's small changes to
patch 7 and rebasing for 8-10 as a result. Overall the code
structure doesn't change, just the transition to REPLACE/REMOVE_OLD
states.

I'm testing the updated series now - it seems like it is working in
both larp=0 and larp=1 mode. I'll let it run overnight and go from
them.

Cheers,

Dave.
