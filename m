Right, so a memcpy() of 16MB of data in a single bio is taking >22s?

If so, then you can't solve this problem with cond_resched() - if
something that should only take half a millisecond to run is taking
22s of CPU time, there are bigger problems occurring that need
fixing.

i.e. if someone is running a workload that has effectively
livelocked the hardware cache coherency protocol across the entire
machine, then changing kernel code that requires memory bandwidth to
be available is not going to fix the problem. All is does is shoot
the messenger that tells you there is something going wrong.

That's not done on every page/bio - that'd done every 4096 pages, or
every 256MB of memory written back on 64k page machines. IOWs, using
cond_resched() here is a sensible thing to do if you have a locked
loop that might run for seconds.

Dave.
