Needs a better subject line, because I had no idea what it meant
until I got to the last hunks in the patch.  Perhaps: "Simplify
inode flush error handling" would be a better summary of the
patch....

There needs to be a comment added to this function to explain why we
always attached the inode to the buffer and update the flush state,
even on error. This:

isn't obviously associated with the "flush_out" label, and so the
structure of the function really isn't explained until you get to
the end of the function. And that's still easy to miss...

Other than that, the code looks OK.

CHeers,
