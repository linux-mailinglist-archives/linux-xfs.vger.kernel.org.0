The restore finished, the beginning is:

...
there are a bunch of lines like that, 'wc' on the file shows:

> wc /tmp/xfsrestore.log 
  5320822  50100130 821050625 /tmp/xfsrestore.log

Then the end of the file looks like:

xfsrestore: NOTE: ino 8485912415 salvaging file, placing in orphanage/256.0/tools/samba/samba-4.14.2/third_party/resolv_wrapper/wscript
xfsrestore: WARNING: unable to rmdir /nhome/./orphanage: Directory not empty

xfsrestore: Restore Summary:
xfsrestore:   stream 0 /backups/ishtar/home/home-211101-0-0737.dump OK (success)
xfsrestore: Restore Status: SUCCESS

The lines in between beginning and end appear to be 
an incrementing inode & file list of the disk as it was
put into the orphanage

The restored file system appears to slightly larger, but
that's likely because I cleared off some garbage from the
current home.

Ah, the xfsdump just finished:

>/root/bin/dump1fs#160(Xfsdump)> xfsdump -b 268435456 -l 0 -L home -e - /home

xfsdump: Dump Status: SUCCESS


Except for the 5.3 million lines between the start+end, the xfsrestore output is above.

I can't imagine why you'd want the 5.3 million lines of
file listings, but if you do, I'll need to upload it somewhere.
