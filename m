Of course.. I completely forgot about that.

I am not sure there is atomic u64 liburcu support for any 32-bit cpu
(even if that cpu does actually support it). Everything is fenced behind
the same conditional (#if CAA_BITS_PER_LONG == 64) in urcu headers
already (e.g. ppc.h or pretty much anything else that falls back to
uatomic/generic.h). So your patch may be the best way forward.

Honestly I am not sure why this isn't implemented at least for x86 (e.g.
via cmpxchg8b). There's a configure option enable-compiler-atomic-builtins
that makes this work, but it doesn't seem to be enabled in distros
(looks fairly new, liburcu commit 3afcf5a0407c).

Regards,
Anthony
