Yup, that's largely what I want clarified before we make a
decision one way or another. There must have been some discussion
and decisions on what the policy is before it was merged, but it's
not easily findable.

And, IMO, instead of every single subsystem having to go through the
same question and answer process as we are currently doing, I want
that policy to be documented such that a simple "git grep
printk_index_subsys_emit" search returns the file in the
Documentation/ directory that explains all this. That makes
everyone's lives a whole lot easier.

Yeah, I'd push back very hard against that, too, but in the absence
of any documentation defining the contract to either the kernel or
userspace application developers, it's impossible to know where we
stand to begin with. I much prefer to be able to quote letter and
verse of the documentation than to have to repeatedly justify why
we consider the (un)documented policy to be broken....

Cheers,

Dave.
