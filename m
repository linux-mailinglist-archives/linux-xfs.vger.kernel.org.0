Yup, the probability of that happening is pretty small, and there's
every chance it could have got stuck on something else racing with
the freeze.

In reality, I don't think that blocking in ->release on freeze is
inherently bad - it will just wait until the filesystem is thawed
and then continue on. i.e. just because the test hangs on closing a
fd on a frozen fs doesn't mean that the freeze mechanism is broken
in any way....

Snapshots. Open files at freeze time will result in post-eof blocks
existing in the snapshot. Mount the snapshot read-only ..... and
that's what the read-only check in xfs_release() catches......

Cheers,

Dave.
