Based on the next patch it seems like blocking notifier are the way
to go and thus this patch should switch to using them and the above
needs updates.

For the final merge candidate at least this comment should go away,
and maybe also the split..

I'm a bit confused by all the extra Kconfig options here.
Why do we need XFS_LIVE_HOOKS, or the existing XFS_DRAIN_INTENTS
instead of just switching the ifdefs to XFS_ONLINE_SCRUB and
selecting JUMP_LABEL if HAVE_ARCH_JUMP_LABEL from
XFS_ONLINE_SCRUB?

Also while I'm at random Kconfig critique, n is the default default
and the default n here can be dropped.  I might just send a patch for
that instead of bothering you once this series is in, though.

Otherwise this looks good except for the choice of which notifier
type to use.
