From this latest posting, I see that the first nine patches all have
multiple reviews.  Some of patches 10-19 have review tags split between
Brian and Christoph, but neither have added them all the way through.
I think I'm the only one who has supplied RVB tags for all forty.

So my question is: at what point would you like me to pull the segments
of this patchset into upstream?  "The maintainer reviewed everything" is
of course our usual standard, but this touches a /lot/ of core logging
code, and logging isn't one of my stronger areas of familiarity.

I think 1-8 look fine for 5.14.  Do you want me to wait for Brian and/or
Christoph (or really, any third pair of eyes) to finish working their
way through 9-11 and 12-25 before merging them?
