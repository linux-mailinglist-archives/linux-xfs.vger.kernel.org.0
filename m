FYI, I couldn't reproduce this at first because sparse inodes is enabled
by default and that introduces more strict inode alignment requirements.
I'm assuming that sparse inodes is disabled in your example, but it
would be more helpful if you included the exact configuration and mkfs
output in such reports.

I'm not really sure what the right answer is here. On one hand, this
patch seems fundamentally reasonable to me. I find it kind of odd for
mount options to override and persist configuration set in the
superblock like this. OTOH, this changes a historical behavior which may
(or may not) cause disruption for users. I also think it's somewhat
unfortunate to change kernel mount option behavior to accommodate
repair, but I think the mount option behavior being odd argument stands
on its own regardless.

What is your actual use case for changing the stripe unit/width at mount
time like this?

Would this change xfs_info behavior on a filesystem mounted with
different runtime fields from the superblock? I haven't tested it, but
it looks like we pull the fields from the superblock.
