Yes it is a bit clunky but *shrug*

The main motivator for this was one piece uses python3 and that Made People
Sad who wanted minimal systems with minimal deps but still wanted xfsprogs.

Keeping services separate is a good idea as well, I think.

I don't have a strong opinion on whether /just/ the service should be separate,
or the scrub util + the service should be separate.

I put all the xfs scrubbing bits in one package in rawhide.
