However, I'm still not convinced that this is the right/best
solution to the problem. It is the easiest, yes, but the down side
on fast/high iops storage and/or under low memory conditions has
potential to be extremely significant.

I suspect that heavy users of buffered O_DSYNC writes into sparse
files are going to notice this the most - there are databases out
there that work this way. And I suspect that most of the workloads
that use buffered O_DSYNC IO heavily won't see this change for years
as enterprise upgrade cycles are notoriously slow.

IOWs, all I see this change doing is kicking the can down the road
and guaranteeing that we'll still have to solve this stale data
exposure problem more efficiently in the future. And instead of
doing it now when we have the time and freedom to do the work, it
will have to be done urgently under high priority escalation
pressures...

Cheers,

Dave.
