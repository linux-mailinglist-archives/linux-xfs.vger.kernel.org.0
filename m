Yep.

OK, that makes sense. Thanks for explanation. So to verify your theory,
I've removed fsync(2) from the test program. So now it is pure create,
write, unlink workload. Results of "stress-unlink 48 /mnt", now for 5000
loops of create-unlink to increase runtime (but the workload does barely
any writes so it should not matter wrt log):

default mkfs params:
	AVG	STDDEV
before	2.0380	0.1597
after	2.7356	0.4712

agcount=96, log size 512M
	AVG	STDDEV
before	1.0610	0.0227
after	1.2508	0.0218

So still notable regression with the async inactivation. With default mkfs
params we'd need more runs to get more reliable results (note the rather
high standard deviation) but with high AG count results show pretty stable
20% regression - so let's have a look at that.

Looking at xfs stats there are barely any differences between before &
after - 'after' writes a bit more to the log but it is ~1.5 MB over the
whole benchmark run, altogether spending some 8ms doing IO so that's not
it. Generally the workload seems to be CPU / memory bound now (it does
barely any IO). Perf shows we are heavily contending on some spinlock in
xfs_cil_commit() - I presume this is a xc_cil_lock. This actually happens
both before and after, but we seem to spend some more time there with async
inactivation. Likely this is related to work being done from worker
threads. Perf stats for comparison:

       1.364539400 seconds time elapsed

So we can see huge increase in context-switches, notable increase in
cache-misses, decrease in cycles/s so perhaps we are bouncing cache more?
Anyway I guess this is kind of expected due to the nature of async
inactivation, I just wanted to highlight that there are regressions without
fsync in the game as well.
