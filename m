Ah, I see. This relocate command is essentially what I was asking for,
it just wasn't apparent from the move_inode bits alone that this was
covered somewhere. I do think there's value in dropping this in
userspace early, even if it's just a crude/isolated implementation for
now, because that helps motivate keeping the kernel bits as simple as
possible for the broader feature. Thanks for the description.
