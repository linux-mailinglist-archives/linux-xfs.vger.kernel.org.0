Yes. We either have to wait for all the iclogs to be written or
we have to use ic_force_wait for sequencing.

That's what the patch I left running overnight does:

        /*
         * If the checkpoint spans multiple iclogs, wait for all previous iclogs
         * to complete before we submit the commit_iclog. We can't use state
         * checks for this - ACTIVE can be either a past completed iclog or a
         * future iclog being filled, while WANT_SYNC through SYNC_DONE can be a
         * past or future iclog awaiting IO or ordered IO completion to be run.
         * In the latter case, if it's a future iclog and we wait on it, the we
         * will hang because it won't get processed through to ic_force_wait
         * wakeup until this commit_iclog is written to disk.  Hence we use the
         * iclog header lsn and compare it to the commit lsn to determine if we
         * need to wait on iclogs or not.

If the previous iclog is a future iclog, then all iclogs are future
iclogs and this iclog is the oldest. The iclog ring only ages in one
direction....

We have to guarantee the log is completely stable up to the commit
record, regardless of which checkpoint the iclogs belong to.  If we
don't do that, then log recovery will consider that the checkpoint
in the log is not complete before it finds the commit record. i.e.
there will be a hole in the log where the previous cycle numbers
show through between the end of the checkpoint and the commit
record, and hence the head of the log will be pointed at the last
fully completed checkpoint, not this one.

Hence we have to ensure all prior iclogs have completed to stable
storage before writing the commit record, regardless of whether the
previous iclogs are part of the current checkpoint or not.

Given that we've found these problems soon after the code was
integrated and made available for wider testing, I think it shows
that, at the integration level, we have sufficiently sensitive crash
and crash recovery tests to discover issues like this. It's not
surprising that we may not find things like this at the
individual developer level because they only have so much time and
resources at their disposal.

IOWs, I think the process is working exactly the way it should be
working. It is expected that complex, subtle problems like these
will be found (if they exist) once more people are actively using
and testing the code in a variety of different environments. THis is
exactly the function that integration testing is supposed to
provide...

So while it's possible that we could have more reliable test to
exercise this stuff (no real idea how, though), the way we are
developing and merging and finding much harder to trigger problems
once the code is available for wider testing shows that our
engineering process is working as it should be....

Cheers,

Dave.
