Sorry if this is out of left field as I haven't followed the discussion
closely, but I presumed one of the reasons Darrick and Christoph raised
the idea of using the folio batch thing I'm playing around with on zero
range for buffered writes would be to acquire and lock all targeted
folios up front. If so, would that help with what you're trying to
achieve here? (If not, nothing to see here, move along.. ;).
