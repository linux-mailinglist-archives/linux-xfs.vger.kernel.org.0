OTOH, not having it is now getting in the way of me being able to turn
XFS_BUF_SET_PRIORITY into a static inline function because the priority
functions reference libxfs_bcache, which ofc only exists in libxfs.  We
have gotten away with this because the preprocessor doesn't care, but
the compiler will.
