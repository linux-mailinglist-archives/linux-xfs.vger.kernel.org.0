Dropped linux-fsdevel from cc. There's no reason to spam -fsdevel with
low level XFS patches.

So you commit a transaction, item1 ends up on the CIL.

g_cil_push() fetches transA's item under xc_cil_lock

xlog_cil_push() doesn't use ->xc_cil_lock, so I'm not sure what this
means. This sequence executes under ->xc_ctx_lock in write mode, which
locks out all transaction committers.

So presumably transB joins item1 while it is on the CIL from trans A and
commits.=20

g_write(), but now, item1 contains content from transB and we have a broken=
 transA

I'm not following how this is possible. The CIL push above, under
exclusive lock, removes each log item from ->xc_cil and pulls the log
vectors off of the log items to form the lv chain on the CIL context.
This means that the transB commit either updates the lv attached to the
log item from transA with the latest in-core version or uses the new
shadow buffer allocated in the commit path of transB. Either way is fine
because there is no guarantee of per-transaction granularity in the
on-disk log. The purpose of the on-disk log is to guarantee filesystem
consistency after a crash.

All in all, I can't really tell what problem you're describing here. If
you believe there's an issue in this code, I'd suggest to either try and
instrument it manually to reproduce a demonstrable problem and/or
provide far more detailed of a description to explain it.

FYI, this patch also doesn't apply to for-next. I'm guessing because
it's based on your previous patch to add the spinlock around the loop.

There's a comment just above that documents this loop that isn't
moved/modified.

This places the associated loop outside of ->xc_ctx_lock, which means we
can now race modifying ->xc_cil during a CIL push and a transaction
commit. Have you tested this?
