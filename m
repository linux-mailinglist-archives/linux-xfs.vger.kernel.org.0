Sure, but this is used as the reservation size for tr_efi. The current
itruncate reservation is clearly more than is required for EFI recovery,
but my point is that the current itruncate code means recovery must
handle EFIs with at least a couple extents (perhaps more based on your
analysis below). Recovery currently processes efi_nextents all in a
single transaction. The current recovery reservation seems to
accommodate current runtime behavior, but does the new reservation based
on this helper satisfy EFIs with >1 extents? I haven't tested it, but it
seems potentially deficient based on inspection...

Ok, well that's a simple enough explanation.. :P

All I want to do wrt to this patch is make sure the recovery reservation
is large enough to process the EFIs it might see in the log based on the
current code.

Agreed.

Sure.

I don't think an allocation transaction is so overloaded as compared to
freeing. I thought reflink was more of a separate remap operation vs
being tied to block allocation, not to say that a remap might depend on
block allocs or not, but both remaps and refcount updates look like
individual intents (along with rmapbt updates associated with block
mappings/allocations). Regardless, I agree that the current transaction
(and associated reservation) situation is a mess, particularly now with
more use of intents, complex chains thereof, and certain transactions
(tr_itruncate/tr_write) being overloaded to the point where they're huge
or simply too difficult to reason about..
