From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

When we modify btrees repeatedly, we regularly increase the size of
the logged region by a single chunk at a time (per transaction
commit). This results in the CIL formatting code having to
reallocate the log vector buffer every time the buffer dirty region
grows. Hence over a typical 4kB btree buffer, we might grow the log
vector 4096/128 = 32x over a short period where we repeatedly add
or remove records to/from the buffer over a series of running
transaction. This means we are doing 32 memory allocations and frees
over this time during a performance critical path in the journal.

The amount of space tracked in the CIL for the object is calculated
during the ->iop_format() call for the buffer log item, but the
buffer memory allocated for it is calculated by the ->iop_size()
call. The size callout determines the size of the buffer, the format
call determines the space used in the buffer.

Hence we can oversize the buffer space required in the size
calculation without impacting the amount of space used and accounted
to the CIL for the changes being logged. This allows us to reduce
the number of allocations by rounding up the buffer size to allow
for future growth. This can safe a substantial amount of CPU time in
this path:

-   46.52%     2.02%  [kernel]                  [k] xfs_log_commit_cil
   - 44.49% xfs_log_commit_cil
      - 30.78% _raw_spin_lock
         - 30.75% do_raw_spin_lock
              30.27% __pv_queued_spin_lock_slowpath

(oh, ouch!)
....
      - 1.05% kmem_alloc_large
         - 1.02% kmem_alloc
              0.94% __kmalloc

This overhead here us what this patch is aimed at. After:

      - 0.76% kmem_alloc_large
         - 0.75% kmem_alloc
              0.70% __kmalloc
