It would be helpful to have some more testing results that show that the direct
I/O support is really working as intended, especially in the new case where
logical_block_size < data_unit_size and buffers are only logical_block_size
aligned --- both with real hardware and with blk-crypto-fallback.  Using my
patchset https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20201112194011.103774-1-ebiggers@kernel.org
it should be possible to test with real eMMC inline encryption hardware on
Snapdragon 630; it has logical_block_size=512.

Also note, generic/587 was already added to the ext4/encrypt and ext4/encrypt_1k
exclusion lists by xfstests-bld commit 02e4bfe628b4.
