The dax flag which was accepted previously and is still accepted now
means dax=always. It just shows both the old and new form of the flag.

Sure. The installer is the first part the gets in contact with the
change. There is no point trying to run the application if your system
does not support dax so the installer chacks that early on. I think that
makes sense. You may need to re-format the filesystem with different
block size or other options to enable dax.

If the kernel makes the information available it will be available both
at installation time and runtime. Currently you can only guess.

That's exactly property of the mount point, nothing else. Technically
inside teh kernels it's probably represented as superblock but that's
impleentation detail.

In the case of dax=always all files presumably behave as if they had the
STATX_ATTR_DAX flag set. Ideally the flag should be returned in this
case even if the inode does not really have it.

In the case of dax=inode you can set this flag if
 - the filesystem driver supports it
 - the filesystem block size matches the
 - the user did not use a ount option that changes the default
 - probably a number of other options
Then the user can set STATX_ATTR_DAX but the files don't magically grow
it. Much like with xattrs, acls, and whatnot. Same thing - the
filesystem must suport it, the on-disk format (if any) must be suitable,
the mount options must enable/not disable teh feature.

What problem do you have with telling the user that filesystem mounted
at /foo supports bar?

Indeed, this attitude of not telling the user if a filesystem supports a
feature and leaving the user with weird hacks to detect it sounds wrong,
irrespective of the application involved.

You know, users use these hacks because the kernel won't tell them in a
sane way.
