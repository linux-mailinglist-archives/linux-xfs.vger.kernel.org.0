No, don't do something I suggested with a flawed understanding of
the code.

Just because *I* suggest something, it means you have to make that
change. That is reacting to *who* said something, not *what was
said*.

So, I may have reservations about the way the storage definitions
are being redefined, but if I had a valid, technical argument I
could give right now I would have said so directly. I can't put my
finger on why this worries me in this case but didn't for something
like, say, the BIGTIME feature which redefined the contents of
various fields in the inode.

IOWs, I haven't really had time to think and go back over the rest
of the patchset since I realised my mistake and determine if that
changes what I think about this, so don't go turning the patchset
upside just because *I suggested something*.

Think critically about what is said and respond to that, not look
at who said it and respond based on their reputation.

Cheers,

Dave.
