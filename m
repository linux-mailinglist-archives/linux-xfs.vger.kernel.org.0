Oh, I must have dropped the comment change when fixing the last
round of rebase conflicts. The minimum of 256 blocks is largely
useless because the even the smallest logs we create on tiny
filesystems are around 1000 filesystem blocks in size. So a minimum
free threshold of 128kB (256 BBs) is always going to be less than
one quarter the size of the journal....

Kind of. What the target does is determine if the AIL needs to do
any work before it goes back to sleep. If we haven't run out of
reservation space or memory (or some other push all trigger), it
will simply go back to sleep for a while if there is more than 25%
of the journal space free without doing anything.

If there are items in the AIL at a lower LSN than the target, it
will try to push up to the target or to the point of getting stuck
before going back to sleep and trying again soon after.

If the OPSTATE_PUSH_ALL flag is set, it will keep updating the
push target until the log is empty every time it loops. THis is
slightly different behaviour to the existing "push all" code which
selects a LSN to push towards and it doesn't try to push beyond that
even if new items are inserted into the AIL after the push_all has
been triggered.

However, because push_all_sync() effectly waits until the AIL is
empty (i.e. keep looping updating the push target until the AIL is
empty), and async pushes never wait for it to complete, there is no
practical difference between the current implementation and this
one.

Yes.

> empties itself?

No. The moment the log tail moves forward because of a removal from
the tail of the AIL via xfs_ail_update_finish(), we call
xlog_assign_tail_lsn_locked() to move the l_tail_lsn forwards and
make grant space available, then we call xfs_log_space_wake() to
wake up any grant waiters that are waiting on the space to be made
available.

The reason for using the "push all" when grant space runs out is
that we can run out of grant space when there is more than 25% of
the log free. Small logs are notorious for this, and we have a hack
in the log callback code (xlog_state_set_callback()) where we push
the AIL because the *head* moved) to ensure that we kick the AIL
when we consume space in it because that can push us over the "less
than 25% available" available that starts tail pushing back up
again.

Hence when we run out of grant space and are going to sleep, we have
to consider that the grant space may be consuming almost all the log
space and there is almost nothing in the AIL. In this situation, the
AIL pins the tail and moving the tail forwards is the only way the
grant space will come available, so we have to force the AIL to push
everything to guarantee grant space will eventually be returned.
Hence triggering a "push all" just before sleeping removes all the
nasty corner cases we have in other parts of the code that work
around the "we didn't ask the AIL to push enough to free grant
space" condition that leads to log space hangs...

Cheers,

Dave.
