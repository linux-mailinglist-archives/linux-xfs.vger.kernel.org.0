Yes, we could change that to return a bool.

It basically assumes that the caller will issue a covering commit
(xfs_sync_sb()) if indicated, and so progresses ->l_covered_state along
in anticipation of that (i.e. NEED -> DONE). The log subsystem side
detects that covering commit and makes further state changes (such as
DONE -> NEED2) for the next time around in the background worker.

In general, I think so. I don't think it technically has to be NEED2 (as
opposed to NEED || NEED2), but in general the idea is to make any such
final superblock updates in-core just before the quiesce completes and
allow the log covering sequence to commit it for us. This is similar to
how this series handles the lazy superblock counters (with the caveat
that that stuff just happened to already be implemented inside
xfs_sync_sb()).

FWIW, we could also enforce that such final superblock updates reset
covered state of the log to NEED2 if we wanted to. I went back and forth
on that a bit but decided to leave out unnecessary complexity for the
first pass.

Yep.

Right, though just to be clear, quiesce never covered the log before
this series. It effectively drained the log by forcing the log and
pushing the AIL until empty, but then just wrote the unmount record to
mark it clean...

Yes. As above, unmount now also does a log cover -> unmount record
instead of just writing the unmount record. This is harmless because we
end up in the clean state either way, but I've tried to point this out
in the commit logs and whatnot so it's apparent to reviewers. We could
technically make the log cover during quiesce optional with a new
parameter or something, but it just didn't seem worth it once we start
overloading the covering sequence to handle things like lazy sb
accounting (or log incompat bits, etc.).

Eric had mentioned that to me as well. I don't quite recall what the
impediment to making that change was the last time around (Eric?), but
my view was that is orthogonal to this series. IOW, the primary
motivations for this series are to clean up the whole xfs_quiesce_attr()
-> xfs_log_quiesce() mess and facilitate the reuse of covering for
things like lazy sb accounting and log incompat bit management. We can
decide whether to quiesce or clean the log on freeze independently and
that's really only a single line tweak to the last patch of the series
(i.e., continue to clean the log and just don't redirty it).
