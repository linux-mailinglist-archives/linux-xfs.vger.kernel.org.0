For the moment, if inode allocation fails because we have busy
inodes after chunk allocation has already been done, then we are
hitting a corner case that isn't typical fast path operation. I
think that we should not complicate things by trying to optimise
this case unnecessarily.

I'd just expedite reclaim using synchronize_rcu() and re-run the
finobt scan as it will always succeed the second time because we
haven't dropped the AGI log and all freed inodes have now passed
through a grace period. Indeed, we need this expedited reclaim path
anyway because if we fail to allocate a new chunk and there are busy
inodes, we need to wait for busy inodes to become unbusy to avoid
premature ENOSPC while there are still avaialbe free inodes.

In the case of the updated inode lifecycle stuff I'm working on, a
log force will replace the synchronise_rcu() call because the inodes
will be XFS_ISTALE and journal IO completion of the cluster buffers
will trigger the inodes to be reclaimed immediately as writeback is
elided for XFS_ISTALE inodes. We may need an AIL push in other
cases, but I'll cross that river when I get to it.

Long term, yes, but we need something that works effectively and
efficiently now, with minimal additional overhead, because we're
going to have to live with this code in the allocation fast path for
some time yet.

Really, I want foreground inode allocation to know nothing about
inode chunk allocation. If there are no inodes available for
allocation, it kicks background inode chunk management and sleeps
waiting for to be given an allocated inode it can use. It shouldn't
even have to know about busy inodes - just work from an in-memory
per-ag free list of inode numbers that can be immediately allocated.

In this situation, inodes that have been recently unlinked don't
show up on that list until they can be reallocated safely. This
is all managed asynchronously in the background by the inodegc state
machine (what I'm currently working on) and when the inode is
finally reclaimed it is moved into the free list and allowed to be
reallocated.

IOWs, the long term direction is to make sure that the
foreground inode allocator doesn't even know about the existence of
busy inodes and it gets faster and simpler as we push all the mess
into the background that runs all the slow path allocation and
freeing algorithms.

Cheers,

Dave.
