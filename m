Agreed. Just to double down on this bit, this is definitely a misguided
assumption. Generally speaking, XFS logging places ordering rules on
metadata writes to the filesystem such that we can guarantee we can
always recover to a consistent point after a crash. By skipping recovery
of a dirty log, you are actively bypassing that mechanism.

For example, if a filesystem transaction modifies several objects, those
objects are logged in a transaction and committed to the physical log.
Once the transaction is committed to the physical log, the individual
objects are free to be written back in any arbitrary order because of
the transactional guarantee that log recovery provides. So nothing
prevents one object from being written back while another is reused (and
re-pinned) before a crash that leaves the filesystem in a corrupted
state. Log recovery is required to update the associated metadata
objects and make the fs consistent again.

In short, it's probably safer to assume any filesystem mounted with a
dirty log and norecovery is in fact corrupted as opposed to the other
way around.
