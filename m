Can you attach the full output for the xfs_dump and xfsrestore

IIRC, it's because xfsdump thinks that the first inode in the
filesystem is the root inode. Which is not always true - there are
corner cases to do with stripe alignment, btree roots relocating and
now sparse inodes that can result in new inodes being allocated at a
lower number than the root inode.

Indeed, the "bind mount?" message is an indication that xfsdump
found that the first inode was not the same as the root inode, and
so that's likely what has happened here.

Now that I think about this, ISTR the above "inodes before root
inode" situation being reported at some point in the past. Yeah:

Eric, can you remember what came of those patches?

Cheers,

Dave.
