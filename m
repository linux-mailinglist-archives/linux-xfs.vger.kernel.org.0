Care to try my old series [1] that attempted to address this, assuming
it still applies to your kernel? You should only need patches 1 and 2.
You can toss in patch 3 if you'd like, but as Dave's earlier patch has
shown, this can just make it harder to reproduce.

I don't know if this will go anywhere as is, but I was never able to get
any sort of confirmation from the previous reporter to understand at
least whether it is effective. I agree with Jens' earlier concern that
the per-page yields are probably overkill, but if it were otherwise
effective it shouldn't be that hard to add filtering. Patch 3 could also
technically be used in place of patch 1 if we really wanted to go that
route, but I wouldn't take that step until there was some verification
that the yielding heuristic is effective.
