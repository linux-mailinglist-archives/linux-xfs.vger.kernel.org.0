Since you now have the same set of RVB tags for patches 3 and 4, I think
it's ok to combine them into a single patch with the same set of RVBs.

(As in: generate diff files for the entire stgit/quilt/guilt stack, pop
to patch 3 in the stack, apply patch 4's diff, update the commit message
for patch 3, commit patch 3, then delete patch 4 from the stack.)

Then tack all the cleanup stuffs onto the end as patches 12-whatever.

That way the cleanups happen and as far as I'm concerned you're not
making any tweaks to the v18 changes that are so large as to demand
re-review.
