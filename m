I really think we need to rework the way we do the error handling
in the command line parsing for these utilities. One of the things I
found in doing this is that most of the code does return error codes
to the main function, only then to drop it on the floor and turn it
into "exitcode = 1; return 0;" pair.

So I'm pondering how to make this much simpler - returning error
codes from the command functions would be a much better idea,
then have a command flag to indicate whether we continue on error or
terminate.

That moves all the exit code handling out of the commands and
provides consistent error handling for all commands and
infrastructure - 0 = success, failure returns negative errno - and
so should enable much more reliable and consistent error handling
across all the utilities....

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Dave.
