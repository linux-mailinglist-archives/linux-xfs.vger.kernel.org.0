Yup, which means you're screwed on XFS, ZFS and btrfs right now, and
also bcachefs when people start using it.

Yes, that why we allow fallocate() to preallocate space that extends
beyond the current EOF. i.e. for optimising layouts on append-based
workloads. posix_fallocate() does not allow that - it forces file
size extension, whilst a raw fallocate(FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE) call
will allow preallocation anywhere beyond EOF without changing the
file size. IOws, with FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE you don't have to
initialise buffer space in memory to cover the preallocated space
until you actually need to extend the file and write to it.

i.e. use fallocate(FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE) to preallocate
chunks megabytes beyond the current EOF and then grow into them with
normal extending pwrite() calls. When that preallocate space is
done, preallocate another large chunk beyond EOF and continue
onwards extending the file with your small write()s...

No heuristics needed: just use FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE and preallocate
large chunks beyond EOF each time. It works for both cases equally
well, which results in less code and is easier to understand.

AFAIC, nobody should ever use posix_fallocate() - it's impossible to
know what it is doing under the covers, or even know when it fails
to provide you with any guarantee at all (e.g. COW files).

Nope. Not desirable, either, because we currently need to have dirty
data in the page cache over delalloc regions.

No, no it isn't. fallocate() is even more important to avoid with
DIO than buffered IO because fallocate() completely serialises *all*
IO to the file. That's the last thing you want with DIO given the
only reason for using DIO is to maximising IO concurrency and
minimise IO latency to individual files.

If you want to minimise fragmentation with DIO workloads, then you
should be using extent size hints of an appropriate size. That will
align and size extents to the hint regardless of fallocate/write
ranges, hence this controls worst case fragmentation effectively.

If you want enospc guarantees for future writes, then large,
infrequent fallocate(FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE) calls should be used. Do
not use this mechanism as an anti-fragmentation mechanism, that's
what extent size hints are for.

Use fallocate() as *little as possible*.

In my experience, fine grained management of file space by userspace
applications via fallocate() is nothing but a recipe for awful
performance, highly variable IO latency, bad file fragmentation, and
poor filesystem aging characteristics. Just don't do it.

Cheers,

Dave.
