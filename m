Ok, the main problem here is that all existing filesystem
implementations don't consider a zero UUID special. If you do this
on an existing kernel, it won't do anything and will not throw any
errors. Now we have the problem that userspace infrastructure can't
rely on the kernel telling it that it doesn't support the
functionality it is relying on. i.e. we have a mounted filesystems
and now userspace has to detect and handle the fact it still needs
to change the filesystem UUID.

Further, if this is not handled properly, every root filesystem
having a zero or duplicate "special" UUID is a landmine for OS
kernel upgrades to trip over. i.e. upgrade from old, unsupported to
new supported kernel and the next boot regens the UUID unexpectedly
and breaks anything relying on the old UUID.

Hence the point of using a feature bit is that the kernel will
refuse to mount the filesysetm if it does not understand the feature
bit. This way we have a hard image deployment testing failure that people
building and deploying images will notice. Hence they can configure
the build scripts to use the correct "change uuid" mechanism
with older OS releases and can take appropriate action when building
"legacy OS" images.

Yes, distros and vendors can backport the feature bit support if
they want, and then deployment of up-to-date older OS releases will
work with this new infrastructure correctly. But that is not
guaranteed to happen, so we really need a hard failure for
unsupported kernels.

So, yeah, I really do think this needs to be driven by a filesystem
feature bit, not retrospectively defining a special UUID value to
trigger this upgrade behaviour...

Cheers,

Dave.
