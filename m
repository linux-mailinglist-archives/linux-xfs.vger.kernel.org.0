Every so often I rotate certain drives from production servers to 
semi-offline servers for testing and verification. The production 
servers have SSD for cache and the fast external journal but the testing 
servers do not. The testing servers need to be able to test and verify 
the filesystem and do periodic synchronization/mirroring but obliviously 
can't use the original filesystem without the journal. Also some of 
these drives are moved offsite so being able to put the journal back to 
its internal position would simplify things.

Of course it would be possible to have extra drives in the testing 
environment that the logs could be moved to but the testing servers are 
very physically limited as to what can be hooked up to them so there 
really isn't enough room or ports for those extra drives. Plus the whole 
offsite thing.

It's more of a "want to help make life easier" than a hard requirement.
