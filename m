Aha, I had wondered why the journal_info thing was in this branch, and
if that would even fit under the usual stable rules...

...but clearly maintainers have been hitting this, so that's ok by /me/ to
have it.  If nothing else, XFS doesn't support nested transactions, so any
weird stuff that falls out was already a dangerous bug.
