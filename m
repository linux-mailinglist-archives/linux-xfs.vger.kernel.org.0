It doesn't really.  We still end up with more convoluted logic after
your series, that goes through a whole bunch of steps that don't make
any sense when the log is already shut down.  Just like everywhere
else we should just return early with a shutdown log / iclog and just
delete this code instead of rearranging the chairs.
