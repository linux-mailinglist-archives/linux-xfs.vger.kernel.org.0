I thought these were documented in the structure definition code as
well. The big picture comments are helpful, but I also think there's
value in brevity and keeping focus on the design vs. configuration
details. I.e., this could just say that the second step is to initialize
the xfs_btree_bload context and refer to the struct definition for
details on the parameters. Similar for some of the steps below. That
also makes it easier to locate/fix associated comments when
implementation details (i.e. the structure, geometry calculation) might
change, FWIW.

"child_ptr is advanced to the next block at the child level."

... or something less vague than "where it needs to be for the next
call." :P Otherwise sounds good.

Doing so helps readability IMO. For whatever reason all the meta ops
associated with the generic btree code tend to make my eyes cross..

I guess a better phrasing is: where is ->bc_nlevels accessed such that
we need to set a particular value here?

Yesterday I just looked at the allocbt code, didn't see an access and
didn't feel like searching through the rest. Today I poked at the bmbt
it looks like the min/max calls there use it, so perhaps that is the
answer.

That might be more consistent..

Hmm.. but doesn't this cause double calls for other cases? I.e. for
non-inode rooted trees it looks like we call the function once, check
the avg_per_block and then potentially call it again until we get to the
root block. Confused.. :/
