So far there isn't such usage yet. dm calls bio_poll() in ->iopoll(),
and its caller(io_uring) will finish the plug.

bio_poll() may be called with rcu read lock held, so I'd suggest to
not mix the two together.

That follows the indentation style of fs/iomap/direct-io.c for break in
'if'.

It is nothing to do with REQ_NOWAIT. sync polled dio can be marked as
REQ_NOWAIT by userspace too. If '--nowait=1' is added in the fio
reproducer, io timeout is triggered too.
