<nod> FWIW I broke this patch up again into the first part that
only does relogging if the checkpoints don't match, and a second part
that does the LSN push target check to see if I could observe any
difference.

Across a ~4h fstests run I noticed that there was about ~20% fewer
relogs, but OTOH the total runtime didn't change noticeably.  I kind of
wondered if the increased cacheline contention would at least slow down
the frontend a bit to give the log a chance to push things out, but
haven't had time to dig any further than "ran fstests, recorded runtimes
and grep | wc -l'd the ftrace log".

Anyway, I was about to resend with all these patches rebased against
something resembling the 5.10 branch, so expect to see this broken out a
bit.
