It may or may not work depending on how we are going to break it up. I
haven't thought through that alternative yet as I am expecting that it
will be a bigger change if we decide to go this route.

The lockdep code has a singular focus on spotting possible deadlock
scenarios from a locking point of view. The freeze dependency has to be
properly translated into appropriate locking sequences to make lockdep
work correctly. I would say that the use of a global fs_reclaim pseudo
lock is not a perfect translation and so it has exception cases we need
to handle.

That is fine. I can wait and post a revised patch after that. Who is
going to make these changes?

Sure.

Thanks for the comments.
