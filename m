Ok, so it's just generating noise, not pointing out actual bugs.
Yup:

cppcheck possible warnings: (new ones prefixed by >>, may not real problems)

So it's even telling us that it might just be generating noise.

If the checker is not pointing out actual bugs, we should just
ignore it. That's what we do with coverity, etc. The code is fine,
I don't find it hard to read or in any way confusing, so I think
it's fine to ignore it...
