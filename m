Yup, so typical IO latency of 2-3ms, assuming 10krpm, assuming we
aren't doing metadata writeback which will blow this out.

I've tested on slower iSCSI devices than this (7-8ms typical av.
seek time), and it didn't show up any performance anomalies.

Even if we take the best case for your example, this still means we
block on every 8 iclogs waiting 2-3ms for the spindle to rotate and
complete the IOs. Hence for a checkpoint of 32MB with 256kB iclogs,
we're blocking for 2-3ms at least 16 times before we get to the
commit iclog. With default iclog size of 32kB, we'll block a couple
of hundred times waiting on iclog IO...

IOWs, we're already talking about a best case checkpoint commit
latency of 30-50ms here.

[ And this isn't even considering media bandwidth there - 32MB on a
drive that can do maybe 200MB/s in the middle of the spindle where
the log is. That's another 150ms of data transfer time to physical
media. So if the drive is actually writing to physical media because
WCE=0, then we're taking *at least* 200ms per 32MB checkpoint. ]

So we add an average of 2-3ms to what is already taking, in the best
case, 30-50ms.

And these are mostly async commits this overhead is added to, so
there's rarely anything waiting on it and hence the extra small
latency is almost always lost in the noise. Even if the extra delay
is larger, there is rarely anything waiting on it so it's still
noise...

I just don't see anything relevant that stands out from the noise on
my systems.

Cheers,

Dave.
