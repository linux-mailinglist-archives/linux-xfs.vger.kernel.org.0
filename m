FWIW, Darrick /just/ added a -d daxinherit option, though all it does
now is set the inheritable dax flag on the root dir, it doesn't enforce
things like page vs block size, etc.

That change is currently staged in my local tree.

I suppose we could condition that on other requirements, although we've
always had the ability to mkfs a filesystem that can't necessarily be
used on the current machine - i.e. you can make a 64k block size filesystem
on a 4k page machine, etc.  So I'm not sure we want to tie mkfs abilities
to the current mkfs environment....

Still, I wonder if I should hold off on "-d daxinherit" patch until we
have thought through things like reflink conflicts, for now.

(though again, mkfs is "perfectly capapable" of making a consistent
reflink+dax filesystem, it's just that no kernel can mount it today...)
