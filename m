Thanks for explanation! It makes sense, except one difference I can see in
vmstat on both marvin7 and dobby which I don't understand:

Dobby:
Ops Sector Reads                     1009081.00     1009081.00
Ops Sector Writes                   11550795.00    18753764.00

Marvin7:
Ops Sector Reads                      887951.00      887951.00
Ops Sector Writes                    8248822.00    11135086.00

So after the change reaim ends up doing noticeably more writes. I had a
look at iostat comparison as well but there wasn't anything particular
standing out besides higher amount of writes on the test disk. I guess,
I'll limit the number of clients to a single number showing the regression,
enable some more detailed monitoring and see whether something interesting
pops up.

Yes, I agree reaim is a stupid workload for today's standards so I'm not
much worried about it as such. Just occasionally it tends to highlight
problems that are valid also for more relevant workloads (just less visible
there) so we still run it.

OK, thanks for suggestion. I can try that as well.
