The caller might not care if this call generates errors, but shouldn't
we care if something fails? IOW, perhaps we should have an exit path
with a WARN_ON_ONCE() or some such to indicate that an unhandled error
has occurred..?

This isn't necessarily true now that we ignore errors. I.e., this also
subtly changes the logic of the function.
