I am fine with that if folks prefer.

I actually struggled a bit with what to call it.  I called it an init 
because in the immediately proceeding code we fall into a loop of 
bunmapi and refilling the state, rolling the transaction in between. 
But we only make this initial call once before we start doing that. 
Later when we get into the state machine this turns into multiple 
iterations of jumping in and out of this region of code.  Even though 
the while() syntax is gone, it still ends up functioning very much like 
a loop.

This helper function isnt so much necessary as much as it is an effort 
to cut down on the size of xfs_attr_node_removename which was getting 
quite lengthy.

In anycase, xfs_attr_leaf_mark_incomplete is fine with me :-)

Right, I clipped off the comment because we dont do the bunmapi in this 
function scope.  That happens later in the loop behavior described above.

Hope that helps!
