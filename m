From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

Every now and then we get a corruption report from the kernel or
xfs_repair about empty leaf blocks in the extended attribute structure.
We've long thought that these shouldn't be possible, but prior to 5.18
one would shake loose in the recoveryloop fstests about once a month.

A new addition to the xattr leaf block verifier in 5.19-rc1 makes this
happen every 7 minutes on my testing cloud.  I added a ton of logging to
detect any time we set the header count on an xattr leaf block to zero.
This produced the following dmesg output on generic/388:

XFS (sda4): ino 0x21fcbaf leaf 0x129bf78 hdcount==0!
Call Trace:

So now we know that someone is creating empty xattr leaf blocks as part
of converting a sf xattr structure into a leaf xattr structure.  The
conversion routine logs any existing sf attributes in the same
transaction that creates the leaf block, so we know this is a setxattr
to a file that has no attributes at all.

Next, g/388 calls the shutdown ioctl and cycles the mount to trigger log
recovery.  I also augmented buffer item recovery to call ->verify_struct
on any attr leaf blocks and complain if it finds a failure:

XFS (sda4): Unmounting Filesystem
XFS (sda4): Mounting V5 Filesystem
XFS (sda4): Starting recovery (logdev: internal)

And a moment later, the _delwri_submit of the recovered buffers trips
the same verifier and recovery fails:

XFS (sda4): Please unmount the filesystem and rectify the problem(s)
XFS (sda4): log mount/recovery failed: error -117
XFS (sda4): log mount failed

I think I see what's going on here -- setxattr is racing with something
that shuts down the filesystem:

Thread 1				Thread 2
--------				--------
xfs_attr_sf_addname
xfs_attr_shortform_to_leaf
<create empty leaf>
xfs_trans_bhold(leaf)
xattri_dela_state = XFS_DAS_LEAF_ADD
<roll transaction>
					<flush log>
					<shut down filesystem>
xfs_trans_bhold_release(leaf)

Thread 3
--------
<cycle mount, start recovery>
xlog_recover_buf_commit_pass2
xlog_recover_do_reg_buffer

xfs_buf_delwri_queue(leaf)
xfs_buf_delwri_submit
_xfs_buf_ioapply(leaf)
xfs_attr3_leaf_write_verify
<trip over empty leaf buffer>
<fail recovery>

As you can see, the bhold keeps the leaf buffer locked and thus prevents
the *AIL* from tripping over the ichdr.count==0 check in the write
verifier.  Unfortunately, it doesn't prevent the log from getting
flushed to disk, which sets up log recovery to fail.

So.  It's clear that the kernel has always had the ability to persist
attr leaf blocks with ichdr.count==0, which means that it's part of the
ondisk format now.  The original patch adding a check to the verifier
was therefore not correct, and the interim patches neutering the check
did not fix the problem completely.  Removing it was the correct
solution, but then the check was added back in 51e6104fdb95.  We clearly
suck at this, so this time replace the incorrect check with a tombstone
comment laying out the entire sad history.

Looking at the rest of the xattr code, it seems that files with empty
leaf blocks behave as expected -- listxattr reports no attributes;
getxattr on any xattr returns nothing as expected; removexattr does
nothing; and setxattr can add attributes just fine.
