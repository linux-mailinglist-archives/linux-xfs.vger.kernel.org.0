Copying build artifacts out of a directory on an xfs filesystem into
some other directory, e.g.

# xfs_db -c 'rdump /rootfs /srv/containers/whatever' /dev/sda1

Without then having to do:

# mv /srv/containers/whatever/rootfs/* /srv/containers/whatever/
# rmdir /srv/containers/whatever/rootfs

I'd be willing to accept more rsync-like behavior where a trailing slash
means "copy children directly into the target dir" and no trailing slash
means "create new child subdir in target dir and copy stuff into that".

IOWs,

xfs_db> rdump /rootfs /srv/containers/whatever

Would always create /srv/containers/whatever/rootfs and copy the
children of /rootfs into that path, but

xfs_db> rdump /rootfs/ /srv/containers/whatever/boot

Would copy the children of /rootfs directly into
/srv/containers/whatever/boot.
