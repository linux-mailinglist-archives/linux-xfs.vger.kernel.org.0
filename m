	Not quite the same as I understand it -- it allows ignoring 
an 'X' permission of directories above the target, I believe, but not other
DAC permissions.  I'd have to experiment to be sure.  In their security
settings dialogue, they warn you against changing it away from the default
as it might cause compatibility problems.

	Yeah, though it doesn't allow overriding DAC settings on files
or directories that have them when trying to access them, just bypassing
directory traversal permissions for items lower in the hierarchy.

	Except that it does more than just allowing directory traversal
to a set of files you own.  Like I think it might not be uncommon to have
some common home dir set restrictively, so you couldn't read who else had
home directories on the system, perhaps, but you could still cd through
it to your own directory.  It may be more like allowing you to 'x' through
parent directories without being able to read/write to them.  CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE
would allow you to override any DAC permissions on any file -- not just
ignore lack of 'X' on a directory.

Well, at least when it is mounted in a linux subsystem -- I haven't checked
out what's possible, but am told explorer can then be used to move through 
file systems that are locally mounted through the linux drivers.

The other possibility -- is a stretch of locally mounted, in having
an XFS drive mounted via CIFS as a "local" drive.  I'd think it would
allow bypassing traverse checking in the same way that having
NT-admin privileges can give you root access to exported drives, but
you have to set it up so that your login has those privs on the target server,
but less drastic privs, like bypassing traverse checking and having
a read/write access for a user that has the backup+restore privs are likely
also supported.  

As an example, a Domain administrator on my NT workstation has root access
to my server (not by accident, but because it is meant to be that way).

I use Win as a desktop, but lin as my diskspace+server.  My Win desktop barely
has enough diskspace for the OS + programs I have installed.
