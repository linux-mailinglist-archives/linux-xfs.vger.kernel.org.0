Here are my selection for v5.15..v5.17:

* 1cd231d9fdb1 - (tag: xfs-5.10.y-7) xfs: use setattr_copy to set vfs
inode attributes
* af09d052db41 - xfs: fallocate() should call file_modified()
* 0daebb90e096 - xfs: reject crazy array sizes being fed to XFS_IOC_GETBMAP=
*
* 35d876873c28 - xfs: prevent UAF in xfs_log_item_in_current_chkpt
* 796e9e00071d - xfs: xfs_log_force_lsn isn't passed a LSN
* fa33747dd25b - xfs: refactor xfs_file_fsync
* 374a05b9a2de - xfs: check sb_meta_uuid for dabuf buffer recovery
* 0b66f78d6af1 - (tag: xfs-5.10.y-6) xfs: remove all COW fork extents
when remounting readonly
* 44caa4c7aaf4 - xfs: remove incorrect ASSERT in xfs_rename
* 4133fc82c95d - xfs: punch out data fork delalloc blocks on COW
writeback failure

The branch of the moment is at:
https://github.com/amir73il/linux/commits/xfs-5.10.y
But I keep force pushing the branch and tags when dropping patches
from the queue.

Note that only half of those commits have Fixes: tag.
As I explained, I got to them by removing all the non-fixes and non-relevan=
t
commits and then tried to evaluate the remaining commits individually.
This was only made scalable because I was working at the patch series
level and not at commit level, although at many times, a single fix patch
was selected from within a non-fix series.

Note that many of the fixes that you selected are impact waves of
big performance improvements that got merged after 5.10, so
were not relevant for my 5.10.y selection.

Thanks,
Amir.
