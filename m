Dave and Allison and I at some point realized that the defer ops
machinery works even if ->create_intent and ->create_done return NULL.
You'd lose the ability to restart the operation after a crash, but if
the upper layers can tolerate a half-finished operation
(e.g.  ATTR_INCOMPLETE) then that should be ok.

Obviously you wouldn't touch any such *existing* code except as part of
adapting it to be capable of using log items, and that's exactly what
Allison did.  She refactor the old xattr code to track the state of the
operation explicitly, then moved all that into the ->finish_item
implementation.  Now, if the setattr operation does not set the LOGGED
flag (the default), the behavior should be exactly the same as before.
If they do set LOGGED (either because the debug knob is set; or because
the caller is parent pointers) then ->create_{intent,done} actually
create log intent and done items.

It should never create an intent item and not the done item or the other
way 'round, obviously.  Either both functions return NULL, or they both
return non-NULL.
