Why?  Now that I've established that the system administrator is and
always has been allowed to invalidate the extent size hints when
realtime volumes are in play, I don't think we need to spam the kernel
log about the admin's strange choices.

The only reason I put that xfs_info_once thing in 603f00 is because I
mistakenly thought that the only way we could end up with a fs like that
was due to gaps in user input sanitization, i.e. fs isn't supposed to be
weird, but it is anyway.
