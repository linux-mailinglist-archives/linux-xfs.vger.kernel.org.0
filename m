Funny thing is I thought about "let's initialize to -1" and gave up because it
seemed ugly :)

Sure, I'm not opposed to fix things automatically, I just thought it wasn't an
acceptable solution, but looks like I'm wrong.

I haven't been following this development. So, you meant geometry mount options
or mount options as a whole?

Sure, but it doesn't fix those filesystems which were already unmounted. But,
fixing it automatically during mount seem to cover this part.

cheers.
