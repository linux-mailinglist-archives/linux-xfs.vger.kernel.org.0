Option (1) means that no qcow2 cluster is allocated at the beginning of
the test so, apart from updating the relevant qcow2 metadata, each write
request clears the cluster first (with fallocate(ZERO_RANGE)) then
writes the requested 4KB of data. Further writes to the same cluster
don't need changes on the qcow2 metadata so they go directly to the area
that was cleared with fallocate().

Option (4) means that all clusters are allocated when the image is
created and they are initialized with fallocate() (actually with
posix_fallocate() now that I read the code, I suppose it's the same for
xfs?). Only after that the test starts. All write requests are simply
forwarded to the disk, there is no need to touch any qcow2 metadata nor
do anything else.

And yes, (4) is a bit slower than (1) in my tests. On ext4 I get 10%
more IOPS.

I just ran the tests with aio=native and with a raw image instead of
qcow2, here are the results:

qcow2:
|----------------------+-------------+------------|
| preallocation        | aio=threads | aio=native |
|----------------------+-------------+------------|
| off                  |        8139 |       7649 |
| off (w/o ZERO_RANGE) |        2965 |       2779 |
| metadata             |        7768 |       8265 |
| falloc               |        7742 |       7956 |
| full                 |       41389 |      56668 |
|----------------------+-------------+------------|

raw:
|---------------+-------------+------------|
| preallocation | aio=threads | aio=native |
|---------------+-------------+------------|
| off           |        7647 |       7928 |
| falloc        |        7662 |       7856 |
| full          |       45224 |      58627 |
|---------------+-------------+------------|

A qcow2 file with preallocation=metadata is more or less similar to a
sparse raw file (and the numbers are indeed similar).

preallocation=off on qcow2 does not have an equivalent on raw files.
