Thank you again Christoph for your earlier answer.

Quick Question: would I be correct in assuming that if I mmap()ed each =
8-64MB (chunk) file from XFS, and then did RDMA from the mmap region, =
that it would first be copied from NVMe into DRAM (does this bypass =
CPU?) and *then* be copied across RDMA, rather than directly be copied =
from NVMe by RDMA? Or does O_DIRECT properly allow bypass straight to =
NVMe for RDMA?

For what this #1 entry are doing though, each of the 512 nodes have =
their own separate XFS FS as well as their own separate RocksDB, both =
backed by NVMe. They are doing filesystem ops almost entirely in =
user-mode (no kernel, no FUSE) by intercepting application binaries and =
rewriting syscall instructions into jumps into their user-mode library =
code and doing message passing to RDMA transfers to/from application =
memory from/to remote node=E2=80=99s NVMe. I don=E2=80=99t believe =
they=E2=80=99ve modified XFS, nor using pNFS. I don=E2=80=99t know if =
there=E2=80=99s any other mechanism though other than mmap() and then =
RDMA on that region?
