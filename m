Brian,

Let's not take this course please.
Please post patches v1 2/4-4/4 without patch v1 1/4
The only objection was to patch 1/4 and it is not strictly needed
to solve the problem you care about.

I had a *concern* about pacthes 2-4, but I can live with that
concern and it is certainly preferred to disabling the tests.

I can follow up with fixing the dmlogwrites common helpers
later when I get the time, so they do not rely on discard for
correctness of replay.

As I wrote, all it takes is to issue an explicit zero/punch command
in the beginning of replay halpers. Just need to find the command
that works correctly and most efficiently with thinp.

If you have the time to do that (since I believe you already tested
some commands) that would be great. Otherwise, I'll do that later.

Thanks,
Amir.
