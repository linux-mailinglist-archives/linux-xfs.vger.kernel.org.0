Heh. Just context on my thought process, FWIW.. We've obviously zeroed
the newly exposed file range for writes that start beyond EOF for quite
some time. This new post-eof range may or may not have been backed by
speculative prealloc, and if so, that prealloc may either be delalloc or
unwritten extents depending on whether writeback occurred on the EOF
extent (assuming large enough free extents, etc.) before the extending
write.

In turn, this means that extending write zero range would have either
physically zeroed delalloc extents or skipped unwritten blocks,
depending on the situation. Personally, I don't think it really matters
which as there is no real guarantee that "all blocks not previously
written to are unwritten," for example, but rather just that "all blocks
not written to return zeroes on read." For that reason, I'm _hoping_
that we can keep this simple and just deal with some potential spurious
zeroing on folios that are already dirty, but I'm open to arguments
against that.

Note that the post-eof zero range behavior changed in XFS sometime over
the past few releases or so in that it always converts post-eof delalloc
to unwritten in iomap_begin(), but IIRC this was to deal with some other
unrelated issue. I also don't think that change is necessarily right
because it can significantly increase the rate of physical block
allocations in some workloads, but that's a separate issue, particularly
now that zero range doesn't update i_size.. ;P

Ok. This maintains zero range performance in my testing so far, so I'm
going to maintain simplicity for now until there's a reason to do
otherwise. I'm open to change it on future iterations. I suspect it
might anyways if this ends up used for more operations...

Thanks again for the comments.
