Yeah.  I guess you could shrink the comment to warn that any code
wanting to /remove/ an AG would need to be careful of the racy sequence
outlined in the three bullet points.  OTOH others have argued against
leaving comments that describe features we don't support.

But maybe it's better just to kill the whole comment like you proposed?

Yes, you have to drain /all/ the incore state that pertains to an AG if
you're going to remove the AG.
