The behaviour of the function when called from xfs_log_force*()
should be unchanged. Can you be specific about exactly what
behaviour did I change for non-synchronous xfs_log_force*() callers
so I can fix it? I have not intended to change it at all, so
whatever you are refering is an issue I need to fix...

Sorry, I don't follow. What "subsystem internals" are being exposed
and what external layer are they being exposed to?

I'm not dismissing review nor am I saying the API cannot or should
not be improved. I'm simply telling you that I think the additional
changes you are proposing are outside the scope of the problem I am
addressing here. I already plan to rework the log force API (and
others) but doing so it not something that this patchset needs to
address, or indeed should address.

There are already enough subtle changes being made to core code and
algorithms that mixing them with unrelated high level external
behavioural changes that it greatly increases the risk of unexpected
regressions in the patchset. The log force are paths are used in
data integrity paths, so I want to limit the scope of behavioural
change to just the AIL where the log force has no data integrity
requirement associcated with it.

Cheers,

Dave.
