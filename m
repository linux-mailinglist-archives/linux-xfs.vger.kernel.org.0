I did, as we talked about on irc.  For anyone following along at home:

As the author who keeps spraying this patch onto the list, I'm still of
a mind to include it. :)  Since we don't really need to relog the
intents unless we need to move the log forward.

That said, even my attempts to force worst case scenarios (make a few
hundred of the big-extent-partially-shared files, truncate them all at
the same time while repeatedly fsyncing (or freezing the fs) still shows
that the relog counts are a tiny percentage of the total transactions
run.  I guess I'll try a higher AG count fs next...
