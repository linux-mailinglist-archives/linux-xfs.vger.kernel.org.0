I kinda planned to kill off inode_dio_wait() for XFS via range
locks. i.e. hold the range lock all the way to DIO completion, then
release it there. This allows things like fallocate, truncate, EOF
extension, etc to run concurrently with all IO and not require
serialisation of the IO in progress to perform extent and size
modification operations.

Cheers,

Dave.
