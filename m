Okay, will definitely do later.

I'm trying to sort out in the next revision if something shows unclear
in the code.

I talked with Dave person-to-person weeks ago about these constraints
on IRC, but I'm not sure I can write out some fluent formal words...

I think there are 2 independent things:
 1) avoiding taking AGI buffer lock if AGI buffer is untouched;
 2) adding a newly unlinked inode to the end of the unlinked list.

So, 2) can be achieved as well without 1) since AGI buffer lock is a
powerful lock and can be recursively taken, but if we'd like to add a
new per-AG iunlink lock, there are some new constraints (locking order
and deadlock concerns) than the current approach.

In summary, due to many exist paths (e.g. tmpfile path), we need to take
lock in the following order:
  AGI buffer lock -> per-AG iunlink lock.

Otherwise it could cause dead lock. And we cannot release per-AG iunlink
lock before all iunlink operations in this trans are commited, or it could
cause iunlink fs corruption...

Yeah, I think that's still true (I tested on my VM before).
