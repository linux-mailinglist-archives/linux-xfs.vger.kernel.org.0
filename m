Sorry about the misunderstanding information in commit message.

> How did you find this? Can you please always document how you found

If user creates million of files and the delete them, We found that the
__percpu_counter_compare costed 5.78% CPU usage, you are right that itself
is not expensive, but it calls __percpu_counter_sum which will use
spin_lock and read other cpu's count. perf record -g is used to profile it:

- 5.88%     0.02%  rm  [kernel.vmlinux]  [k] xfs_mod_ifree
   - 5.86% xfs_mod_ifree
      - 5.78% __percpu_counter_compare
           5.61% __percpu_counter_sum

0.03% is just __percpu_counter_compare's usage.

Hmm, I have done it and I didn't describe this problem clearly, with this
patch, 5.78%(__percpu_counter_compare) will disappear. I will follow
your method and reduce unnecessary noise.
