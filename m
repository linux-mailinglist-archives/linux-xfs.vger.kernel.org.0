Hmm.. it seems so at first glance, but I'm not sure I follow the
calculations in that function. If we factor out the obvious
num_ops/num_trees components, the comment refers to the following
generic formula:

	((2 blocks/level * max depth) - 1)

I take it that since this is a log reservation calculation, the two
block/level multiplier is there because we have to move records between
two blocks for each level that splits. Is there a reason the -1 is
applied after that multiplier (as opposed to subtracting 1 from the max
depth first)? I'm wondering if that's intentional and it reflects that
the root level is only one block...
