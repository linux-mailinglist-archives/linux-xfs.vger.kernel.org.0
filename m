I think we're both wrong about which commits this patch applies to.

The error return for blkdev_issue_flush failing to unlock ic_sema was
introduced in b5d721 when we added the bailout there.

The error return for xlog_map_iclog_data failing to unlock ic_sema was
introduced back in 842a42d126b4 ("xfs: shutdown on failure to add page
to log bio") back in 5.7.  So that's the original bug.

That said, I think the stable rules say that the Fixes tag is supposed
to help AUTOSEL, so they want the newest commit.  Since you all are
doing the backports by hand I suppose the AUTOSEL rules might not matter
as much.

So, uh... let's tag all three? :)
