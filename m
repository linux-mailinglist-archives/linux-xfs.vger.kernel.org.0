It's basically a requirement introduced by this patch that any
transaction that wants to enable relog on an item needs to check whether
the "central relog ticket" already exists, and if not, it needs to
contribute reservation to it as part of its normal transaction
allocation process.

No, only the transaction that commits the quotaoff start intent.

I hope not. :P At least I haven't seen such issues in my (fairly limited
and focused) testing so far.

Yeah, I was back and forth on this because the relog reservation
tracking thing is a bit of complexity itself. It's much simpler to have
the AIL or something allocate a relog transaction up front and just keep
it around for the lifetime of the mount. My thinking was that relogs
could be quite rare (quotaoff, scrub), so it's probably an unfair use of
resources. I figured it best to try and provide some flexibility up
front and we can always back off to something more simplified later.

If we ended up with something like a reloggable "zero on recovery"
intent for writeback, that ties more into core fs functionality and the
simpler relog ticket implementation might be justified.

This ties in to the size calculation of the relog transaction and the
fact that the contributing transaction rolls before it carries on to
normal use. IOW, this approach adds zero extra reservation consumption
to existing transaction commits, so there should be no additional risk
of reservation overrun in that regard.

More the latter...

This comment was more of a note to self that when putting this together
I hadn't thought through the abort/shutdown path and whether the code is
correct (i.e., should the transaction cancel relog state? I still need
to test an abort of a relog commit, etc.). That's still something I need
to work through, but I wouldn't read more into the comment than that.
