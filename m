Except now you've got the problem that dpkg-buildflags is not used
by various packages such as xfsprogs, so the flags it sets up,
even with overrides like DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS are completely
ignored by the debian package build because debian/rules is not set
up to source the buildflags at all.

e.g. if you run 'make Q= deb' you won't see any of the compiler or
linker options emitted by dpkg-buildflags being used during the
debian package build. You will, OTOH, see it emit stuff like LTO
options because those get turned on via configure.

The default dpkg-buildflags output already includes "hardening"
options, and as I said above, they aren't actually included in the
build rules. Hence what you suggest just won't work like you think
it should.

Again, if you want build option stuff to work correctly, don't rely
on distro specific magic to turn stuff on because it just doesn't
work for everyone. Use configure options to enable, probe and detect
support and enable the feature in the build, then upstream and other
distros can actually build with it and test it outside the magical
unicorn distro build environment you are running in...

Cheers,

Dave.
