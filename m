And if you read a little further down, I say:

And look, 4 years later this unnecessary CVE is still wasting
multiple peoples' valuable time.

the old XFS seek hole/data code did ilock -> page_lock, while
everything else in XFS (like readahead, writeback, etc) does
page_lock -> ilock.

> Is this CVE solved? Can I see the demsg in other way? thanks.

Yes. back in 2017 we completely rewrote the seek hole/data
implementation around the iomap infrastructure with
iomap_seek_hole and iomap_seek_data. These do not have a lock
inversion problem. commit 9b2970aacfd9 ("xfs: Switch
to iomap for SEEK_HOLE / SEEK_DATA") is the one that switched XFS,
but there are several more that introduce the infrastructure it
uses.

Cheers,

Dave.
