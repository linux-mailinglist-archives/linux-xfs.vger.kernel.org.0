We need not right, as long as we have one in xfs_defer_finish_noroll(),
because we commit everything before returning from
xfs_reflink_remap_extent(). And we do have XFS_TRANS_PERM_LOG_RES set,
so xfs_defer_finish_noroll() should always be called. 
(Apologies, if I am not making sense. I new to XFS code)

I gave generic/175 an overnight run with cond_resched() call inside
xfs_defer_finish_noroll() loop. I couldn't reproduce the soft lockup bug.

So does it sound ok to have cond_resched() within
xfs_defer_finish_noroll(). I can submit the new version then.

This should solve the soft lockup problems in both unmapping of extents
causing large transaction chains and also reflink remapping path.

Yes, I agree that life will be easy if we don't have to play with the
hacks of putting such calls within tight loops. But until we have such
infrastructure ready, I was hoping we could find a correct fix for such
problems for current upstream and old stable kernels.


Thanks for the review and suggestions!
