Thank you for the detailed response, Dave! I downloaded and built the
latest xfsprogs (5.14.2) and tried to run a metadump with the
parameters:

xfs_metadump -g -o -w /dev/md4 /exports/home/work/md4.metadump

It says:

Metadata CRC error detected at 0x56384b41796e, xfs_agf block 0x4d7fffd948/0x1000
xfs_metadump: cannot init perag data (74). Continuing anyway.

It starts counting up inodes and gets to "Copied 418624 of 83032768
inodes (1 of 350 AGs)"

The it stops with an error:

xfs_metadump: inode 2216156864 has unexpected extents

I don't see any disk read errors or SAS errors logged in dmesg. MD
array is still online and running as far as I can tell.

Where should I go from here?

Thanks,

Sean
