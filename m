Yeah.  If I had my way I'd refactor the bumplink/droplink operations
into deferred log items so that we wouldn't have to think so hard about
locking order.  That's a /lot/ of extra code though.

Right.

Hm.  I don't know how you'd do explicit AGF locking up front because the
AG is selected by the block allocator.  I think we can set t_firstblock
to trick the allocator into skipping the AGs before max(wip, target_ip),
but I don't see how we could get any closer than that?

I guess the downside is that locking the AGIs ahead of time means that
our allocation choices are severely constrained if either inode is in
the last AG.  We could try to reduce the likelihood of that by making
xfs_ialloc_ag_select start in AG 0 for whiteout creations since
RENAME_WHITEOUT is the only creation path, I think.  But that would
still leave us vulnerable to ENOSPC shutdowns if the last AGs are
totally full.
