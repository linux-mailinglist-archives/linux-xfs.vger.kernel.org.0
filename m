Does that happen before/after swap is enabled?

What problems can arise from a failed repair here?

Also, ISTR historical problems with doing initrd based root fs
operations because it's not uncommon for the root filesystem to fail
to cleanly unmount on shutdown.  i.e. it can end up not having the
unmount record written because shutdown finishes with the superblock
still referenced. Hence the filesystem has to be mounted and the log
replayed before repair can be run on it....

As long as it doesn't result in an unbootable system on failure, it
sounds like a good idea to me.

Cheers,
