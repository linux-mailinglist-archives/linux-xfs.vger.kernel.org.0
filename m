Because I think it's the wrong cleanup to apply to xfs_attr_set().
xfs_attr_set() needs to be split into two - a set() function and a
remove() function to get rid of all the conditional "if
(arg->value)" logic in it that separates set from remove. Most
of the code in the function is under such if/else clauses, and the
set() code is much more complex than the remove() case. Folding the
attr lookup into the xfs_attr_set() doesn't do anything to address
this high level badness, and to split it appropriately we need to
keep the common attr lookup code in it's own function.

I updated the patch to has a single xfs_attr_lookup() call instead
of one per branch, but I don't think removing the helper is the
right way to go here...

Cheers,

Dave.
