Ok.

Eric, did you change the machine you did the release build from?

I'm not denying that it fixed your problem. As a reviewer, I'm
supposed to point out where the proposed fix doesn't match with
expected usage. And as a reviewer, I expect that patched get changed
to address problems that are found before they are committed, not to
be told:

"It made my problem go away, so my job is done."

You didn't report it upstream so we could avoid the regression in
future, to either the debian package maintainers or the XFS lists.
Nor do you seem to care if the fix is correct or whether anyone else
might need it.

In future, if there is a regression in the upstream xfsprogs
package, please report it upstream and not just keep it to yourself
and hack around it.

Cheers,

Dave.
