That logic only changedf for xfs_trans_ail_update_bulk()...

which only inserts into the AIL, so will never trigger the "wake up
if AIL empty" code that is now there because the AIL will never be
empty...

If we are calling xfs_trans_ail_update_bulk() with zero log items on
an empty AIL, we are probably doing something else wrong. But doing
a wakeup on anything waiting on an empty log will not hurt anything
in this case, because the log was already empty and there should be
nothing waiting for the log to empty...

So, yes, it is safe and won't cause strange issues....
