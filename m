Before anything else, could you please try to run the latest xfsprogs from:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/xfs/xfsprogs-dev.git/log/?h=master

A quick test in my laptop using the metadump you provided, finished the repair
in about 5 mintues:

Maximum metadata LSN (2138201505:-135558109) is ahead of log (96:0).
Format log to cycle 2138201508.
