I guess not...? :(

In /me's head, S_DAX is a best-effort affair -- if the storage supports
it, and the cpu supports it, and the fs supports it, and the sysadmin
didn't forbid it, and there's no file state preventing it, *then* you
actually get S_DAX.  DIFLAG2_DAX is merely advisory, so it's perfectly
valid for reflink to come along and add a file state that (on this
kernel) prevents DIFLAG2_DAX from causing S_DAX to get set.

(We've probably already gone around and around on this elsewhere, but
I'm catching up on 6 weeks of email...)

I think the bitflag tests need parentheses around them, right?
