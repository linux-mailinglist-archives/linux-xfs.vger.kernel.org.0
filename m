It would be, but we'd still have to track which directory entries are
thee ones that we don't want to preserve.  We could rewrite the
directory entry to point to a plausible inode number that isn't
allocated, but that runs the risk that someone will come along and
allocate that inode for lost+found and then we're really in a mess.

Alternately, I suppose we could rewrite the directory entry to be a
DHT_WHITEOUT entry that doesn't look like any that the kernel would
produce ... insofar as I'm not even sure what the real ones were
supposed to look like, given the weird left turn that overlayfs took on
that. :(
