If we decide that we want to allow in-place upgrade, then this is
the way we've done it in the past. remember how long we supported
reading v1 inodes but only supported writing v2 inodes? i.e. we
converted old 16 bit nlink inodes to 32 bit nlink inodes silently
and automatically when they were dirtied.

i.e. once the superblock feature bit is set, we can convert inode
the timestamp format on inode writeback.

Sure, we can do that, too, but the kernel code still has to support
reading and write both formats. Given that, on-the fly conversion is
a trivial addition to the code...

Yup, but those are relatively recent things when compared to when
the XFS on-disk format was defined... :P

Cheers,
