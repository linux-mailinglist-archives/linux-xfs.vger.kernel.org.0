The blocks used for allocation btrees (bnobt and countbt) are
technically considered free space. This is because as free space is
used, allocbt blocks are removed and naturally become available for
traditional allocation. However, this means that a significant
portion of free space may consist of in-use btree blocks if free
space is severely fragmented.

On large filesystems with large perag reservations, this can lead to
a rare but nasty condition where a significant amount of physical
free space is available, but the majority of actual usable blocks
consist of in-use allocbt blocks. We have a record of a (~12TB, 32
AG) filesystem with multiple AGs in a state with ~2.5GB or so free
blocks tracked across ~300 total allocbt blocks, but effectively at
100% full because the the free space is entirely consumed by
refcountbt perag reservation.

Such a large perag reservation is by design on large filesystems.
The problem is that because the free space is so fragmented, this AG
contributes the 300 or so allocbt blocks to the global counters as
free space. If this pattern repeats across enough AGs, the
filesystem lands in a state where global block reservation can
outrun physical block availability. For example, a streaming
buffered write on the affected filesystem continues to allow delayed
allocation beyond the point where writeback starts to fail due to
physical block allocation failures. The expected behavior is for the
delalloc block reservation to fail gracefully with -ENOSPC before
physical block allocation failure is a possibility.

To address this problem, introduce an in-core counter to track the
sum of all allocbt blocks in use by the filesystem. Use the new
counter to set these blocks aside at reservation time and thus
ensure they cannot be reserved until truly available. Since this is
only necessary when perag reservations are active and the counter
requires a read of each AGF to fully populate, only enforce on perag
res enabled filesystems. This allows initialization of the counter
at ->pagf_init time because the perag reservation init code reads
each AGF at mount time.
