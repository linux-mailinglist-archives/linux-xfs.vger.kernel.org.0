The big question I have is: for at least the standard -g all runs, does
this decrease the number of tests selected?  AFAICT all it does is
converts mkfs option parsing _fail into _notrun, but a 35k shell script
patch is a lot to take in.

If it doesn't change the number of tests selected to run then I think
I'm ok with this.
