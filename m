At a first quick look, it looks like you are having lots of IO contention i=
n the
log, and this is slowing down the rest of the filesystem. What caught my
attention at first was the wrong configured log striping for the filesystem=
 and
I wonder if this isn't the responsible for the amount of IO contention you =
are
having in the log. This might well be generating lots of RMW cycles while
writing to the log generating the IO contention and slowing down the rest o=
f the
filesystem, I'll try to take a more careful look later on.

I can't say anything if there is any bug related with the issue first becau=
se I
honestly don't remember, second because you are using an old distro kernel =
which
I have no idea to know which bug fixes have been backported or not. Maybe
somebody else can remember of any bug that might be related, but the amount=
 of
threads you have waiting for log IO, and that misconfigured striping for th=
e log
smells smoke to me.

I let you know if I can identify anything else later.

Cheers.
