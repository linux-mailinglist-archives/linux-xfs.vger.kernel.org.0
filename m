seems fine in general but a couple thoughts...

Hm, we really don't use xfs_sb_version_hasrealtime() very consistently, but it might
be worth doing here?

I wish we had a feature flag to cross-ref against, a corruption in sb_rblocks will lead
to an untouchable filesystem, but I guess there's nothing we can do about that.

Actually, would it help to cross-check against the rtdev arg as well?  Should we do anything
different if the user actually specified a realtime device on the commandline?

I mean, I suppose
