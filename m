Hi, Dave

Thanks for the reply. Yes, your analysis seems reasonable, it helped me a
lot to understand the intent lifecycle.

Why do we need to remove the intent from the AIL at this point, shouldn't
it be removed from the AIL when the done intent is committed? Or is there
any way to ensure that the intents are removed from the AIL when they are
processed.

Yes, if the processed intent has been removed from the AIL, then only the
unprocessed intent remains in the current AIL, and it is safe to cancel
the intent.
