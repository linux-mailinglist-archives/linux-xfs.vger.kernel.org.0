Long ago, a young developer tried to fix a segfault in xfs_repair where
a short progress reporting interval could cause a timer to go off and try
to print a progress mesage before any had been properly set up because
we were still busy zeroing the log, and a NULL pointer dereference
ensued.

That young developer got it wrong, and completely broke progress
reporting, because the change caused us to exit early from the pthread
start routine, and not initialize the progress timer at all.

That developer is now slightly older and wiser, and finally realizes that
the simple and correct solution here is to initialize the message format
to the first one in the list, so that we will be ready to go with a
progress message no matter when the first timer goes off.

It might be nice to add progress reporting for the log zeroing, but that
requires renumbering all these macros, and we don't/can't actually get
any fine-grained progress at all, so probably not worth it.
