Sorry for the late response. I was trying to understand the code flow.

Here is a snippet of perf trace explaining what is going on,

	 760881:           mount  8654 [002]   216.813041:                         probe:xlog_grant_push_ail: (c000000000765864) comm="xfsaild/loop1" threshold_cycle_s32=3 threshold_block_s32=3970 need_bytes_s32=389328 last_sync_cycle_u32=2 last_sync_block_u32=19330 free_threshold_s32=5120 free_bytes_s32=383756 free_blocks_s32=749 l_logsize=10485760 reserve_cycle_s32=3 reserve_block_s32=9513204(~18580 blocks) tail_cycle_s32=2 tail_block_s32=19330

... Explaination follows,

760881:           mount  8654 [002]   216.813041:                         probe:xlog_grant_push_ail: (c000000000765864) comm="xfsaild/loop1" threshold_cycle_s32=3 threshold_block_s32=3970 need_bytes_s32=389328 last_sync_cycle_u32=2 last_sync_block_u32=19330 free_threshold_s32=5120 free_bytes_s32=383756 free_blocks_s32=749 l_logsize=10485760 reserve_cycle_s32=3 reserve_block_s32=9513204(~18580 blocks) tail_cycle_s32=2 tail_block_s32=19330
The above trace data shows that threshold_lsn is set to wrap around the
log. However since the last synced lsn has a much lesser value,
xlog_grant_push_ail() will set threshold_lsn to last_sync_lsn. This ends up
being the value of xfsaild_push()'s target.


786576: kworker/4:1H-kb  1825 [004]   217.041079:                       xfs:xfs_log_assign_tail_lsn: dev 7:1 new tail lsn 2/19333, old lsn 2/19330, last sync 3/18501
An item in AIL was relogged and hence the item was moved to the tail end of
AIL. Since the head of AIL has changed, the tail_lsn's value is updated.

793653:   xfsaild/loop1  8661 [004]   265.407708:                probe:xfsaild_push_last_pushed_lsn: (c000000000784644) comm="xfsaild/loop1" cycle_lsn_u32=0 block_lsn_u32=0 target_cycle_lsn_u32=2 target_block_lsn_u32=19330
Since the target LSN wasn't updated, we still have the old value.

793654:   xfsaild/loop1  8661 [004]   265.407717:              probe:xfsaild_push_min_lsn_less_than: (c0000000007846a0) comm="xfsaild/loop1" less_than_s32=0 cycle_lsn_u32=2 block_lsn_u32=19333 lip_x64=0xc000000303fb4a48
The lip at the head of AIL has an LSN greater than target.

xfs_info from the corresponding disk,
# xfs_info /dev/loop1
meta-data=/dev/loop1             isize=512    agcount=4, agsize=159648 blks
         =                       sectsz=512   attr=2, projid32bit=1
         =                       crc=1        finobt=1, sparse=1, rmapbt=0
         =                       reflink=0
data     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=638592, imaxpct=25
         =                       sunit=0      swidth=0 blks
naming   =version 2              bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0, ftype=1
log      =internal log           bsize=4096   blocks=2560, version=2
         =                       sectsz=512   sunit=0 blks, lazy-count=1
realtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0

i.e the log size was 2560 * 4096 = 10485760 bytes.

After increasing the log size to 4193 blocks (i.e. 4193 * 4k = 17174528
bytes) and also the patch applied, I don't see the dead lock happening.

Please let me know if the trace provided above isn't sufficient and you need
a traces for the "larger log size" case also.

Meanwhile, I am planning to read more code to map the explaination
provided below.
