I think that's a very neat idea, but it will not address the reference
benchmark.
The reference benchmark I started the original report with which is similar
to my understanding to the benchmark that Chi is running simulates the
workload of a database writing with buffered IO.

That means a very large file and small IO size ~64K.
Leaving the probability of intersecting writes in the same segment quite hi=
gh.

Can we do this opportunistically based on available large folios?
If IO size is within an existing folio, use the folio lock and IOLOCK_SHARE=
D
if it is not, use IOLOCK_EXCL?

for a benchmark that does all buffered IO 64K aligned, wouldn't large folio=
s
naturally align to IO size and above?

Thanks,
Amir.
