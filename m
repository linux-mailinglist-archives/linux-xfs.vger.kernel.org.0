Thanks for the explanation.

I guess the commit message confused me a bit, especially these two sentences:

"Any page of a process can be migrated to such memory. However no one should be
allowed to pin such memory so that it can always be evicted."

I read them as if the OS is free to choose which pages are migrated to
this memory,
and anything is eligible for migration to that memory (and that's why
we also don't
allow it to pin memory there).

If we are not allowed to pin anything there, can the device driver
decide to disable
any option for oversubscription of this memory area ?

Let's assume the user uses this memory area for doing p2p with other
CXL devices.
In that case, I wouldn't want the driver/OS to migrate pages in and
out of that memory...

So either I should let the user pin those pages, or prevent him from
doing (accidently or not)
oversubscription in this memory area.

wdyt ?
