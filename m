Oh!  Well that clears up a misconception then!  For the whole time I've
been maintainer, I'd assumed (and worried about) that for-next was not
to be rewritten under any circumstances once pushed and announced,
unless a commit was found to be so bad that rewriting history was a
better option.

"Tagged and pull requested" is a lower and easier standard.  Good.

<nod> That I can do.

After Linus merged the last of the xfs-5.13-fixes branch.  I can never
really settle my mind as to whether to keep master on -rc1 or push it
forward.  Leaving it at -rc1 is less churn, but OTOH there are (rather
frequently) bugs in other parts of the kernel that I hear about breaking
peoples' (or my own) ability to test, so I push it forward when things
seem to have stabilized.

(or at least, every other kernel since about 5.5 has had /some/ stupid
problem in the mm/block/networking code that has caused me personally
to see a higher rate of random test regressions, which means I've now
internalized pushing master to -rc4 because it takes a month for that
to shake out)

Fair enough.  Next cycle, I'll update master when I put out the first
-fixes branch and leave it there all the way through.
