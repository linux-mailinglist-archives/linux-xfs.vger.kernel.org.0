Darrick was concerned about that.

Some sort of xfstest is needed in order to be able to merge this
so he has some confidence that it won't break things.

I volunteered to do have a go at writing a test.

I've given that some thought and done an initial survey of xfstests
but it's still new to me so I'm not sure how this will end up.

Darrick thought it would need a generic test to test VFS options
and one in xfs for the xfs specific options.

At this point I'm thinking I'll have a go at adding an xfs specific
options test but, while I can find out what the optionsare and what
validation they use, there's a lot about some of the xfs options
I don't fully understand so I don't know what a sensible test might
be.
