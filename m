I'm curious about your motivation for letting transaction nest here.
Seeing as the ENOSPC return should be infrequent, are you simply not
wanting to cycle the memory allocators and the FREEZE_FS counters?

Hm.  I guess at this point the only resources we hold are the FREEZE_FS
counter and *tp itself.  The transaction doesn't have any log space
grants or block reservation associated with it, and I guess we're not in
PF_MEMALLOC_NOFS mode either.  So I guess this is ok, except...

...except that doing so will collide with what we've been telling Yafang
(as part of his series to detect nested transactions) as far as when is
the appropriate time to set current->journal_info/PF_MEMALLOC_NOFS.

Errk, will fix that.
