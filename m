 An inode object represents an object within the filesystem.
 
+Reference counting rules
+------------------------
+
+The inode is reference counted in two distinct ways, an i_obj_count refcount and
+an i_count refcount. These control two different lifetimes of the inode. The
+i_obj_count is the simplest, think of it as a reference count on the object
+itself. When the i_obj_count reaches zero, the inode is freed.  Inode freeing
+happens in the RCU context, so the inode is not freed immediately, but rather
+after a grace period.
+
+The i_count reference is the indicator that the inode is "alive". That is to
+say, it is available for use by all the ways that a user can access the inode.
+Once this count reaches zero, we begin the process of evicting the inode. This
+is where the final truncate of an unlinked inode will normally occur.  Once
+i_count has reached 0, only the final iput() is allowed to do things like
+writeback, truncate, etc. All users that want to do these style of operation
+must use igrab() or, in very rare and specific circumstances, use
+inode_tryget().
+
+Every access to an inode must include one of these two references. Generally
+i_obj_count is reserved for internal VFS references, the s_inode_list for
+example. All file systems should use igrab()/lookup() to get a live reference on
+the inode, with very few exceptions.
+
+LRU rules
+---------
+
+This is tightly coupled with the reference counting rules above. If the inode is
+being held on an LRU it must be holding both an i_count and an i_obj_count
+reference. This is because we need the inode to be "live" while it is on the LRU
+so it can be accessed again in the future.
+
+This is different how we traditionally operated. Traditionally we put 0 refcount
+objects on the LRU, and then when eviction happened we would remove the inode
+from the LRU if it had a non-zero refcount, or evict it if it had a zero
+refcount.
+
+Now the rules are much simpler. The LRU has a live reference on the inode. That
+means that eviction simply has to remove the LRU and call iput_evict(), which
+will make sure the inode is not re-added to the LRU when putting the reference.
+If there are other active references to the inode, then when those references
+are dropped the inode will be added back to the LRU.
+
+We have two uses for i_lru, one is for the normal inactive inode LRU, and the
+other is for pinned inodes that are pinned because they are dirty or because
+they have pagecache attached to them.
+
+The dirty case is easy to reason about. If the inode is dirty we cannot reclaim
+it until it has been written back. The inode gets added to super block's cached
+inode list when it is dirty, and removed when it is clean.
+
+The pagecache case is a little more complex. The VM wants to pin inodes into
+memory as long as they have pagecache. This is because the pagecache has much
+better reclaim logic, it accounts for thrashing and refaulting, so it needs to
+be the ultimate arbiter of when an inode can be reclaimed. The inode remains on
+the cached list as long as it has pagecache to account for this. When pages are
+removed from the inode the VM calls inode_add_lru() to see if the inode still
+needs to be on the cached list or on the inactive LRU.
+
+Holding a live reference on the inode has one drawback. We must remove the inode
+from the LRU in more cases that previously, which can increase contention on the
+LRU. In practice this won't be a problem, because we only put the inode on the
+LRU that doesn't have a dentry associated with it. When we grab a live reference
+to an inode we must delete it from the LRU in order to make sure that any unlink
+operation results in the inode being removed on the final iput().
+
+Consider the case where we've removed the last dentry from an inode and the
+inode is added to the LRU list. We then lookup the inode to do an unlink. The
+final iput in the unlink path will just reduce the i_count to 1, and the inode
+will not be truly removed until eviction or unmount.  To avoid this we have two
+choices, make sure we delete the inode from the LRU at
+drop_nlink()/clear_nlink() time, or make sure we delete the inode from the LRU
+when we grab a live reference to it. We cannot do the drop at
+drop_nlink()/clear_nlink() time because we could be holding the i_lock.
+Additionally there are awkward things like BTRFS subvolume delete that do not
+use the nlink of the subvolume as the indicator that it needs to be removed, and
+so we would have to audit all of the possible unlink paths to make sure we
+properly deleted the inode from the LRU. Instead, to provide a more robust
+system, we remove an inode from the LRU at igrab() time. Internally where we're
+already holding the i_lock and use inode_tryget() we will delete the inode from
+the LRU at this point.
+
+The other case is in the unlink path itself. If there was a truncate at all we
+could have ended up on the cached list, so we already have an elevated i_count.
+Removing the inode from the LRU explicitly at this stage is necessary to make
+sure the inode is freed as soon as possible.
