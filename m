<nod> FWIW I'd traced a generic/475 shutdown hang as far as "the AIL
seems to be stuck on a locked dquot buffer" but haven't really had a
chance to look into what was going on at the time.

Whereas before it would usually hang if I let it run more than about 15
minutes, now I've been able to get it to run all night to completion.
