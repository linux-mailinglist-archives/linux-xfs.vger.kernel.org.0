Which is effectively fixed length segments....

Yes, I know why you've done it. These were the same arguments made a
while back for a new way of cloning files on XFS. We solved those
problems just with a small change to the locking, and didn't need
new ioctls or lots of new code just to solve the "clone blocks
concurrent IO" problem.

I'm looking at this from exactly the same POV. The code presented is
doing lots of complex, unusable stuff to work around the fact that
UNSHARE blocks concurrent IO. I don't see any difference between
CLONE and UNSHARE from the IO perspective - if anything UNSHARE can
have looser rules than CLONE, because a concurrent write will either
do the COW of a shared block itself, or hit the exclusive block that
has already been unshared.

So if we fix these locking issues in the kernel, then the whole need
for working around the IO concurrency problems with UNSHARE goes
away and the userspace code becomes much, much simpler.

The filtering presenting in the patch above will not defrag any of
this with a 2048 block segment side, because the second extent in
each segment extend beyond the configured max segment length. IOWs,
it ends up with a single extent per "2048 block segment", and that
won't get defragged with the current algorithm.

As it is, this really isn't a common fragmentation pattern for a
file that does not contain shared extents, so I wouldn't expect to
ever need to decide if this needs to be defragged or not.

However, it is exactly the layout I would expect to see for cloned
and modified filesystem image files.  That is, the common layout for
such a "cloned from golden image" Vm images is this:

1.    1		written
2.    2049	shared
3.    2		written
4.    2050	shared
5.    1		written
6.    2051	shared

i.e. there are large chunks of contiguous shared extents between the
small individual COW block modifications that have been made to
customise the image for the deployed VM.

Either way, if the segment/filter length is 2048 blocks, then this
isn't a pattern that should be defragmented. If the segment/filter
length is 4096 or larger, then yes, this pattern should definitely
be defragmented.

Sure, but implementing a low performing, high CPU consumption,
entirely single threaded defragmentation model that requires
specific tuning in every different environment it is run in doesn't
seem like the best idea to me.

I'm trying to work out if there is a faster, simpler way of
achieving the same goal....

Cheers,

Dave.
