OK, so how much testing has this had on just a straight v5.15-rcX
kernel?

Ok, that's a bad behaviour we need to fix because it will cause
things like old versions of xfs_dump to miss inodes that
have overflowing extent counts. i.e. it will cause incomplete
backups, and the failure will likely be silent.

I asked about -EOVERFLOW because that's what stat() returns when an
inode attribute value doesn't fit in the stat_buf field (e.g. 64 bit
inode number on 32 bit kernel), and if we are overflowing the
bulkstat field then we really should be telling userspace that an
overflow occurred.

/me has a sudden realisation that the xfs_dump format may not
support large extents counts and goes looking...

Yeah, xfsdump doesn't support extent counts greater than 2^32. So
that means we really do need -EOVERFLOW errors here.  i.e, if we get
an extent count overflow with a !(bc->breq->flags &
XFS_IBULK_NREXT64) bulkstat walk, xfs_dump needs bulkstat to fill
out the inode with the overflow with all the fileds that aren't
overflowed, then error out with -EOVERFLOW.

Bulkstat itself should not silently skip the inode because it would
overflow a field in the struct xfs-bstat - the decision of what to
do with the overflow is something xfsdump needs to handle, not the
kernel.  Hence we need to return -EOVERFLOW here so that userspace
can decide what to do with an inode it can't handle...

Cheers,

Dave.
