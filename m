Woot!

/me wonders if you need commit 9a5280b312e2 xfs: reorder iunlink remove
operation in xfs_ifree ?  Or did that one already get pulled in?

The changes proposed look reasonable to me, and moreso with the testing
to prove it.  Minor nit: patchsets should be tagged "PATCH", not "PATH".

Thanks to you and Luis for doing this work! :)

/me looks and sees a large collection of expunge lists, along with
comments about how often failures occur and/or reasons.  Neat!

Leah mentioned on the ext4 call this morning that she would have found
it helpful to know (before she started working on 5.15 backports) which
tests were of the flaky variety so that she could better prioritize the
time she had to look into fstests failures.  (IOWS: saw a test fail a
small percentage of the time and then burned a lot of machine time only
to figure out that 5.15.0 also failed a percentage of th time).

We talked about where it would be most useful for maintainers and QA
people to store their historical pass/fail data, before settling on
"somewhere public where everyone can review their colleagues' notes" and
"somewhere minimizing commit friction".  At the time, we were thinking
about having people contribute their notes directly to the fstests
source code, but I guess Luis has been doing that in the kdevops repo
for a few years now.

So, maybe there?
