Ok, Thanks! I was asking for a real name :)

I thought using some error code as well, yet my perference finally
about this could be a functional feature (e.g. non-RCU / completely
retry by using -ECHILD / -ESTALE in lookup code). For such 2 level
internal seperate functions, I'd like to use some tri-state return
value in order to avoid breaking some potential or upcoming functional
features.

Yeah, but it's just my own thought, anyway. I will switch to use
some error code in the next version.

Yeah, I didn't think much more about it to really change the logic.
My starting point was that I always feel a bit more uncomfortable
about randomly add some perag lock/unlock for such like function
(with random multiple exits, and xfs_alloc.c extent allocation
almost the same...). Hard to review and maybe potential unbalanced
bugs here....

Ok, Thanks for the patch/direction! let me play with it for a while,
and if you don't care I'll make it together with the series (although
the whole progress could be somewhat slow though...)

Thanks,
Gao Xiang
