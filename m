I agree the comment is a little confusing because to me, it's just
describing a bit too much for its context. I.e., I read the comment and
have to go look at other code to make sure I grok the comment rather
than the comment helping me grok the code it's associated with.

FWIW, I find something like the following a bit more clear/concise on
the whole:

        /*
+        * Once AIO and DIO has drained we flush and (if necessary) invalid=
ate
+        * the cached range over the first operation we are about to run. W=
e
+        * include zero and collapse here because they both start with a ho=
le
+        * punch over the target range. Insert and collapse both invalidate=
 the
+        * broader range affected by the shift in xfs_prepare_shift().
         */

... because it points out why we special case collapse here, and that
otherwise the prepare shift code is responsible for the rest. Just my
.02 and otherwise the patch looks good to me.
