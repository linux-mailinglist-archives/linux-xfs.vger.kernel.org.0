At the current moment (keep in mind that I have 2,978 more emails to get
through before I'm caught up), I think it's safe to say that for patches
1-5:

Acked-by: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

(patch 9 also, but see the reply I just sent for that one about grabbing
the sync_fs fixes too)

The log changes are going to take more time to go through, since that
stuff is always tricky and /not/ something for me to be messing with at
4:45pm.
