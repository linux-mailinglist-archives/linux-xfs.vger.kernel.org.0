Given that it's rol7 and xoring, I'd love it if someone came up with a
gentler obfuscate_name() that at least tried to generate obfuscated
names that weren't full of control characters and other junk that make
ls output horrible.

Buuuut doing that requires a deep understanding of how the math works.
I think I've almost grokked it, but applied math has never been my
specialty.  Mark Adler's crc spoof looked promising if we ever follow
through on Dave's suggestion to change the dahash to crc32c, but that's
a whole different discussion.

That would be simpler for metadump, yes.

I'm going to introduce a followup series that adds a new xfs_db command
to generate obfuscated filenames/attrs to exercise the dabtree hash
collision resolution code.  I should probably do that now, since I
already sent xfs/861 that uses it.

It wouldn't be the end of the world if hashcoll didn't work on asciici
filesystems, but that /would/ be a testing gap.
