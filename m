Yes, but that is largely irrelevant. It requires the RT device to
function, and the RT device functionality is entirely unchanged. All
that changed was the initial data allocation policy to select
whether the RT or data device would be used, and that really isn't
that controversial as we've always suggested this is a potential use
of the RT device (fast and slow storage in the one filesystem
namespace).

There are almost always downstream modifications in private cloud
storage kernels, even if it is just bug fixes. They aren't shipping
the code to anyone, so they don't have to publish those changes.
However, the presence of downstream changes doesn't mean the
upstreram functionality should be considered unused and can be
removed....

IIRC, we were simply waiting on an updated patchset to address
review comments...

Cheers,

Dave.
