+1

Yeah I'd prefer to not get bogged down in that, it can be done later,
or not. Let's focus on the core of the proposal, even though I'm
academically intrigued by log growth possibilities.

(he says, then comments more)

It can be any sufficiently large free space, right, doesn't have to
be adjacent to the log. So as long as you've expanded more than 64MB
there's a chance to move to a bigger log region, I think.

Yeah I mean it only matters if you want to change the log size, right.
So could even do

# xfs_expand --grow-data=4T --grow-log=2G fs-image.img
Error: Cannot grow a dirty log, please mount ...
# 

But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves a little, let's see if
the basic proposal makes sense before debating extra bells and
whistles too much? It's probably enough at this point to say
"yeah, it's possible if we decide we want it, the design does not
preclude it."
