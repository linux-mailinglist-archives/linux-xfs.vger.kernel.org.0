Hi all,

I've been noticing sporadic failures with djwong-dev with xfs/141, which
is a looping log recovery test.  The primary symptoms have been that
online fsck reports incorrect free extent counts after some number of
recovery loops.  The root cause seems to be the use of sb_frextents in
the xfs_mount for incore reservations to transactions -- if someone
calls xfs_log_sb while there's a transaction with an rtx reservation
running, the artificially low value will then get logged to disk!
If that's the /last/ time anyone logs the superblock before the log
goes down, then recovery will replay the incorrect value into the live
superblock.  Effectively, we leak the rt extents.

So, the first thing to do is to fix log recovery to recompute frextents
from the rt bitmap so that we can catch and correct ondisk metadata; and
the second fix is to create a percpu counter to track both ondisk and
incore rtextent counts, similar to how m_fdblocks relates to
sb_fdblocks.

The next thing to do after this is to fix xfs_repair to check frextents
and the rt bitmap/summary files, since it doesn't check the ondisk
values against its own observations.

If you're going to start using this mess, you probably ought to just
pull from my git trees, which are linked below.

This is an extraordinary way to destroy everything.  Enjoy!
Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
