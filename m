The patch looks good to me. I've added it to my tree.

Yeah, that looks like a good thing to do. Also FS_DQ_LIMIT_MASK contains
real-time limits bits which quota tools aren't able to manipulate in any
way so maybe not setting those bits would be wiser... Will you send a patch
or should I just fix it?
