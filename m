Some, yes.

The upper delay threshold where performance is measurably
impacted is in the order of single digit milliseconds, not
microseconds.

What I saw was that as the batch processing delay goes beyond ~5ms,
IPC starts to fall. The CPU usage profile does not change shape, nor
does the proportions of where CPU time is spent change. All I see if
data cache misses go up substantially and IPC drop substantially. If
I read my notes correctly, typical change from "fast" to "slow" in
IPC was 0.82 to 0.39 and LLC-load-misses from 3% to 12%. The IPC
degradation was all done by the time the background batch processing
times were longer than a typical scheduler tick (10ms).

Now, I've been testing on Xeon CPUs with 36-76MB of l2-l3 caches, so
there's a fair amount of data that these can hold. I expect that
with smaller caches, the inflection point will be at smaller batch
sizes rather than more. Hence while I could have used larger batches
for background processing (e.g. 64-128 inodes rather than 32), I
chose smaller batch sizes by default so that CPUs with smaller
caches are less likely to be adversely affected by the batch size
being too large. OTOH, I started to measure noticable degradation by
batch sizes of 256 inodes on my machines, which is why the hard
queue limit got set to 256 inodes.

Scaling the delay/batch size down towards single inode queuing also
resulted in perf degradation. This was largely because of all the
extra scheduling overhead that trying to switching between user task
and kernel worker task for every inode entailed. Context switch rate
went from a couple of thousand/sec to over 100,000/s for single
inode batches, and performance went backwards in proportion with the
amount of CPU then spent on context switches. It also lead to
increases in buffer lock contention (hence context switches) as both
user task and kworker try to access the same buffers...

Cheers,

Dave.
