It's been told it to go slow... :/

.... because "-P" turns off prefetching and all the IO optimisation
that comes along with the prefetching mechanisms. In effect, "-P"
means "go really slowly".

Try:

# xfs_repair -o bhash_size=101371 -o ag_stride=100 /dev/sdk

To get a good sized buffer cache and a decent (but not excessive)
amount of concurrency in the scanning processing. It still may end
up being slow if it has to single thread walk a huge btree
(essentially pointer chasing on disk), but at least that won't hold
up all the other scanning that isn't dependent on that huge btree..

Cheers,

Dave.
