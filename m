OK.

Then, can the description of

	__WQ_LEGACY		= 1 << 18, /* internal: create*_workqueue() */

be improved to something like

	/*
	 * This flag disables deadlock detection which can happen when flushing
	 * a work item in !WQ_MEM_RECLAIM workqueue from WQ_MEM_RECLAIM workqueue.
	 * But try to avoid using this flag, by adding WQ_MEM_RECLAIM to all WQs which
	 * can be involved where a guarantee of forward progress under memory pressure
	 * is required.
	 */

? Current /* internal: create*_workqueue() */ tells me nothing.



My question is: I want to add WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag to the WQ used by loop module
because this WQ is involved upon writeback operation. But unless I add both
__WQ_LEGACY | WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flags to the WQ used by loop module, we will hit

	WARN_ONCE(worker && ((worker->current_pwq->wq->flags &
			      (WQ_MEM_RECLAIM | __WQ_LEGACY)) == WQ_MEM_RECLAIM),

warning because e.g. xfs-sync WQ used by xfs module is not using WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag.

	mp->m_sync_workqueue = alloc_workqueue("xfs-sync/%s",
				XFS_WQFLAGS(WQ_FREEZABLE), 0, mp->m_super->s_id);

You are suggesting that the correct approach is to add WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag to WQs
used by filesystems when adding WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag to the WQ used by loop module
introduces possibility of hitting

	WARN_ONCE(worker && ((worker->current_pwq->wq->flags &
			      (WQ_MEM_RECLAIM | __WQ_LEGACY)) == WQ_MEM_RECLAIM),

warning (instead of either adding __WQ_LEGACY | WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flags to the WQ used
by loop module or giving up WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag for the WQ used by loop module),
correct?
