Overall I suppose that what you did sounds reasonable, unless I'm missing
something about the MD raid state. Having that many drives failing out
sounds bad.  Any idea how many blocks got skipped with your dd clone?

well ... from the xfs POV, yes, but xfs_repair is not a data recovery tool,
it is designed to make the filesystem consistent again, not to recover
all data.  (that might sound a bit glib, but while repair obviously tries
to salvage/correct what it can, in the end, the goal is consistency.)

There's not much xfs_repair can do if the block device has been severely
scrambled beneath it.

maybe? :) not sure, personally. I have never used a data recovery service.

Sorry for your data loss. I'd suggest asking these questions of the
md raid folks as well, because I think that's where your problems started,
and frankly xfs / xfs_repair may have been handed an impossible task.

(Not blaming md; perhaps the hardware failure made this all inevitable,
but maybe they md devs thoughts on your recovery attempts.)
