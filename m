No useful comment here as the attr logging code is new to me, but what
is the LARP mode?  I see plenty of references to it in commit logs,
a small amount in the code mostly related to error injection, but it
would be really good to expand the acronym somehwere as I can't find
any explanation in the code or commit logs..
