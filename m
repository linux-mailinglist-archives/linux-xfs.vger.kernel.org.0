At some point I wonder if we'd be better off with a #define mask that
covers all the flags that we preserve on transaction roll.

Shouldn't we check this at xfs_trans_alloc time so that it's immediately
obvious when someone screws up?

What happens if t_blk_res + delta would overflow t_blk_res?  Can you
make some (probably contrived) scenario where this is possible?

I'm also a little surprised that you don't subtract delta from
t_blk_res_used (at least until t_blk_res_used == 0).  Doing it this way
means that we'll ratchet up t_blk_res_used and t_blk_res every time we
ping pong, which feels a little strange.  But maybe you can elaborate?
