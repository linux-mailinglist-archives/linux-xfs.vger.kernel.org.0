Sorry, I cheched again.
This is a xfs filesystem with 2G device and 2G rtdev device

Although I still fail to check/set the attr by 'lsattr/chattr', but I
can check the free space of 'normal' and realtime subvol now.

# xfs_db -c sb -c p /dev/sdb8 |grep 'fdblocks\|frextents'
typedef struct xfs_sb {
...
	uint64_t	sb_fdblocks;	/* free data blocks */
	uint64_t	sb_frextents;	/* free realtime extents */
...
}

And based the info from Carlos Maiolino

FB were running a modified kernel that selected the rt dev based on
the initial allocation size. Behaviour for them was predictable
because they also controlled the application that was storing the
data. See:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20171128215527.2510350-1-rwareing@fb.com/

With a dirty patch below for test only , Now realtime subvol will be used
as I expected, and that can be confirmed by
#xfs_db -c sb -c p /dev/sdb8 |grep 'fdblocks\|frextents'.

Thanks a lot.
