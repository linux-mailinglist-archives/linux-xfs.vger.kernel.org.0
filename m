The new code, like the original code, is not actually a "hard" limit.
It's essentially just throttles ongoing work until the CIL push
starts. In this case, it forces the current process to give up the
CPU immediately once over the CIL high limit, which allows the
workqueue to run the push work straight away.

I thought about making it a "hard limit" by blocking before the CIL
insert, but that's no guarantee that by the time we get woken and
add the new commit to the CIL that this new context has not already
gone over the hard limit. i.e. we block the unbound concurrency
before commit, then let it all go in a thundering herd on the new
context and immeidately punch that way over the hard threshold
again. To avoid this, we'd probably need a CIL ticket and grant
mechanism to make CIL insertion FIFO and wakeups limited by
remaining space in the CIL. I'm not sure we actually need such a
complex solution, especially considering the potential serialisation
problems it introduces in what is a highly concurrent fast path...

Cheers,

Dave.
