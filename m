I agree up to the point where it relates to this specific EFI recovery
issue. reflink is enabled by default, which means the default EFI
recovery reservation is going to have 7 logcount units. Is that actually
enough of a reduction to prevent this same recovery problem on newer
fs'? I'm wondering if the tr_efi logcount should just be set to 1, for
example, at least for the short term fix.
