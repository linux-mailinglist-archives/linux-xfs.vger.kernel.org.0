You forgot to unlock the perag before locking the AGI, so of course
it will deadlock.

Yes, I know my psuedocode example didn't explicitly unlock the perag
because I simply forgot to write it in as I was going. It's pretty
common that quickly written psuedo code to explain a concept is not
perfect, so you still need to think about whether it is correct,
complete, etc.  i.e. if you do:

Thread 1			Thread 2
 lock AGI
                                 lock perag
 lock perag
                                 trylock AGI
				 unlock perag
                                 lock AGI
				 <blocks>

There is no deadlock in this algorithm.

That's kind of what I'd expect - if there is contention on the AGI,
the trylock will fail and we know we are about to sleep. The point
is that "trylock fails" now gives us a point at which we can measure
contention that puts us into the slow path. And because we are now
in the slow path, the overhead of backing out just doesn't matter
because we are going to sleep anyway.

We use this pattern all over XFS to attempt to get locks in reverse
order with minimal overhead in fast paths...

I think that's a mistake - it's smells of trying to optimise the
implementation around immediately observed behaviour instead of
designing a clean, well structured locking scheme that will not need
to be re-optimised over and over again as the algorithm it protects
changes over time.

Cheers,

Dave.
