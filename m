Yeah, we're in a quiescent context at this point where no other
transactions are running, the in-core structures should be drained and
the background log worker cancelled, etc. With regard to the background
log worker, I don't think it should ever actually see the DONE or DONE2
states as it sets those states and immediately issues the synchronous sb
transaction. Therefore, the commit should have changed the state from
DONE to NEED2 or NEED (if other items happened to land in the log)
before it returns.

That said, I suppose it wouldn't be that surprising if some odd timing
scenario or combination of external superblock commits could cause the
background log worker to see a DONE state. I haven't fully audited for
that, but regardless it would appropriately do nothing and that
shouldn't be an issue from the quiesce context due to the runtime being
pretty much shut down by this point.

Right, that changes due to the lazy sb counter logic..
