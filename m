Another option could be to just retain the existing error checking logic
and wrap it in an ifdef. I.e.:

#ifndef DEBUG
	/* shrink only allowed in debug mode for now ... */
	if (nb < mp->m_sb.sb_dblocks)
		return -EINVAL;
#endif

Then the rest of the function doesn't have to be factored differently
just because of the ifdef.
