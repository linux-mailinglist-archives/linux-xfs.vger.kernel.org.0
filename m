That would be a kworker on the "xfs-cil/%s" workqueue, correct?
And you mean before the lockup, when the I/O is still active, correct?

This is the usual stack output from that thread:

I see. I hope, you can make use of the following.

Result: 594 rather similar events logged before filesystem locked up after 29 iterations of the copy loop

The third iovec sometimes has len=48 instead of len=16.

Last two events before the lockup:

Correct. In the above part of the mail, where I described the load, that was reffering to your question "It takes the best part of *50 seconds* before the push work actually runs?". So this was related to the specific test from which the quoted loglines were.

The second part of the email was just about the question, whether it can be demonstrated that items in the CIL shrink. This was the followup to "Do you have tracing showing the operation where the relogged item has actually gotten smaller?" and "But, of course, if the size is not expected to decrease, this discrepancy must be clarified anyway. I am sure, I can find out the exact circumstances, this does happen. I will follow up on this. "

As soon as I added that logging, I got events from the system disk ("sda1") during boot activity. This already seemed to answer the question whether log items shrink (rightfully or wrongfully). So I didn't even start the described workload on the md devices. I should have made this difference clear and apologize that you needed to spend time to figure that out.
