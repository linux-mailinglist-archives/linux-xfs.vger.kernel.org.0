Okay, I understood. I'm a newbie to XFS here. I'll try to add more
reasons/thoughts from now on with my current limited knowledage
about XFS.

Yeah, I saw many patchsets of you.. Partially due to my limited
knowledge and somewhat limited English skill though... But I will
write more as much as possible to get myself better...

Thanks for your review. b.t.w, would you tend to drop all extra ASSERTs
or leave these ASSERTs for a while to catch potential issues on this
patch?... And in addition I will try to find more potential cases, if
not, I will just send out with updated commit messages (maybe without
iunlink orphan inode related part, just to confirm?).

Thanks,
Gao Xiang
