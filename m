It ought to, but it might be too late for that because
_init_*key_from_rec have been letting the unwritten bit slip into the
rmap key structures since 4.8.  Somewhere out there is a filesystem with
rmapbt node blocks containing struct xfs_rmap_key's with that unwritten
bit set.  The best we can do is ignore it in the key comparison
function.

Let me think about this overnight though, because once we stop paying
attention to the unwritten bit for key comparisons, it might not matter
what's in the ondisk node blocks.
