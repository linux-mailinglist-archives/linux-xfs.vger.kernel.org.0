We could do that, but my understanding of the equivalent logic in the
current algorithm is that we want broad coverage of both near mode
sub-algorithms across the entire suite of tests. Hence we randomly drop
allocations into either algorithm when DEBUG mode is enabled. IIRC, we
do something similar with sparse inodes (i.e., randomly allocate sparse
inode chunks even when unnecessary) so the functionality isn't only
covered by targeted tests.

Do we have the ability to have always on error tags as such? I thought
we had default frequency values for each tag, but I thought they still
had to be explicitly enabled. If that's the case, I'm sure we could come
up with such an on-by-default mechanism and perhaps switch over these
remaining DEBUG mode hacks, but that's a follow up thing IMO..
