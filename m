Using the terminology "expunge db" is wrong here because it suggests
that flakey tests (which are obviously part of that db) should be in
expunge list as is done in kdevops and that is not how Josef/Ted/Darrick
treat the flakey tests.

The discussion should be around sharing fstests "results" not expunge
lists. Sharing expunge lists for tests that should not be run at all
with certain kernel/disrto/xfsprogs has great value on its own and I
this the kdevops hierarchical expunge lists are a very good place to
share this *determinitic* information, but only as long as those lists
absolutely do not contain non-deterministic test expunges.

For example, this is a deterministic expunge list that may be worth sharing:
https://github.com/linux-kdevops/kdevops/blob/master/workflows/fstests/expunges/any/xfs/reqs-xfsprogs-5.10.txt
Because for all the tests (it's just one), the failure is analysed
and found to be deterministic and related to the topic of the expunge.

However, this is also a classic example for an expunge list that could
be auto generated by the test runner if xfs/540 had the annotations:

_fixed_in_version xfsprogs 5.13
_fixed_by_git_commit xfsprogs 5f062427 \
      "xfs_repair: validate alignment of inherited rt extent hints"

As a requirement, what I am looking for is a way to search for anything
known to the community about failures in test FS/NNN.

Because when I get an alert on a possible regression, that's the fastest
way for me to triage and understand how much effort I should put into
the investigation of that failure and which directions I should look into.

Right now, I look at the test header comment and git log, I grep the
kdepops expunge lists to look for juicy details and I search lore for
mentions of that test.

In fact, I already have an auto generated index of lore fstests
mentions in xfs patch discussions [1] that I just grep for failures found
when testing xfs. For LTS testing, I found it to be the best way to
find candidate fix patches that I may have missed.

I would love to have more sources to get search results from.
There doesn't even need to be a standard form for the search or results.

If Leah, Darrick, Ted and Josef would provide me with a script to search
their home brewed fstests db, I would just run all those scripts and
see what they have to tell me about FS/NNN in some form of human
readable format that I can understand.

Going forward, we can try to standardize the search and results
format, but for getting better requirements you first need users!

Thanks,
Amir.
