Indeed, that is true.

Yeah, that makes sense for the current use case. There's a broader
sequence involved there that provides some throttling and serialization,
along with the fact that the workload is imminently driving into
-ENOSPC.

I think what had me a little concerned upon seeing this is whether the
scanning mechanism is currently suitable for the broader usage
introduced in this series. We've had related issues in the past with
concurrent sync eofblocks scans and iolock (see [1], for example).
Having made it through the rest of the series however, it looks like all
of the new scan invocations are async, so perhaps this is not really an
immediate problem.

I think it would be nice if we could somehow assert that the task that
invokes a sync scan doesn't hold an iolock, but I'm not sure there's a
clean way to do that. We'd probably have to define the interface to
require an inode just for that purpose. It may not be worth that
weirdness, and I suppose if code is tested it should be pretty obvious
that such a scan will never complete..
