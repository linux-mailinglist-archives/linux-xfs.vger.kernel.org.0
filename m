Yeah, but why would we want to block xfsaild on a single item like that?
Wouldn't holding the item locked like that just create a new stall point
within xfsaild? Maybe I'm missing something, but what you describe here
basically just sounds like a "lock the item and run a sync log force"
pattern.

I agree that the implementation I handwave about above seems overkill,
but I'm really curious what the disadvantage of some form of logic in
the logging code to do something like "if this checkpoint contains items
that are AIL resident && under some measure of writeback pressure && the
next iclog is active, want_sync the commit record iclog on background
push to reduce item pin count times" might be.
