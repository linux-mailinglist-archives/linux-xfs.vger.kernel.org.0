Nit: extra whitespace line above.

This still seems racy to me, FWIW. What if the AIL is empty (i.e. the
push is skipped)? What if xfsaild completes this push before the
associated log items land in the AIL or we race with xfsaild emptying
the AIL? Why not just reuse/update the existing grant head wake up logic
in the iclog callback itself? E.g., something like the following
(untested):

@@ -740,12 +740,10 @@ xfs_trans_ail_update_bulk(

 	}
+

}

... seems to solve the same prospective problem without being racy and
with less and more simple code. Hm?
