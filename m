Yes, this came up in the last review, but the reason I avoid it is 
because I think the transaction looks weird in either helper.  The 
reason the roll is here is because there is no room to add the attr as a 
leaf, and so we need to hand it off to the node subroutines.  But that 
seems like something that should be managed by the caller, not leaf 
helpers.  So I was concerned that separating the split and the hoist 
would generate more weird looks from people trying to understand the 
split until the see the hoist in the next patch.  If people really think 
it looks better that way, I can split them up.  But I know folks have a 
tough enough time trying to recall the discussion history, so I'm trying 
to avoid confusion of another type :-)

Thoughts?
