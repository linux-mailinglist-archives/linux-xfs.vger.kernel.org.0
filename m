Why, exactly do we need to transfer the ownership of the inode lock
here? 

The code that runs in the workqueue does not attempt to lock the
inode in any way, nor should it be trying to assert that the inode
is locked because it's just doing btree work that -requires- the
inode to be locked long before we get to these layers. If anything
deep in the BMBT split code is trying to assert that the inode is
locked, just remove those assertions as we've already run these
asserts long before we hand this work off to another thread.

lockdep is a PITA when it comes to using semaphores as they were
intended because lockdep is task context centric and semaphores are
data object centric. i.e. with semaphores, the data object owns the
lock, not the task context, and that creates a horrible impedence
mismatch between the semaphore locking and lockdep tracking models.
IOWs, lockdep has major issues with this, so the two options here are:

	1. get rid of lockdep checks in the paths where we pass
	locked semaphores to other task contexts; or

	2. add lockdep checks for "lockdep_assert_held_non_owner()"
	where it just checks that the lock is held read/write but
	without checking the owner matches.

#2 matches how our existing inode locking assert checks work - we
don't care who locked the inode, just that it is locked in the
correct mode.

This would get rid of the need to pass rwsem lockdep contexts
between tasks. That, in turn, gets rid of all the nesting and
annotation problems that this attmept to pass lockdep contexts to
non-owner tasks introduces....

Cheers,

Dave.
