Hmm, it seems like sort of a hack to key this off the program name.
Though Eric mentioned on IRC that Dave or someone expressed a preference
for xfs_db not being gated on O_EXCL when a user is trying to run the
program for *debugging*.

Perhaps "if (strcmp(progname, "xfs_db") &&" here?  Just in case we add
more shell script wrappers for xfs_db in the future?  I prefer loosening
restrictions as new functionality asks for them, rather than risk
breaking scripts when we discover holes in new code later on.

At first I wondered about the -i case where ISREADONLY and ISINACTIVE
are set, but then I realized that -i ("do it even if mounted") isn't
used by xfs_admin and expressly forbids the use of O_EXCL.  So I guess
the equivalence test and the assignment below are ok, since x.isreadonly
is zero at the start of xfs_db's init() function, and we'll never have
to deal with other flags combinations that might've snuck in from
somewhere else.  Right?

> +		x.isreadonly = LIBXFS_EXCLUSIVELY;

But this is still a mess.  Apparently libxfs_init_t.isdirect is for
LIBXFS_DIRECT, but libxfs_init_t.isreadonly is for other four flags?
But it doesn't really make much difference to libxfs_init() because it
combines both fields?

Can we turn this into a single flags field?  Not necessarily here, but
as a general cleanup?

...and maybe teach libxlog not to have this global variable?
