Can you try creating an xfs_metadump of the filesystem, and see if the
segfault is reproducible?

Then, if you are willing to share it (in private) we could do some
debugging.

To create the xfs_metadump:

# xfs_metadump /dev/$WHATEVER metadump.meta

To see if the image reproduces the problem,

# xfs_mdrestore metadump.meta metadump.img

(Note that both metadump.meta and metadump.img are metadata-only, contain
no file data, and will take FAR less than 28T of disk space.)

If so, and if you're OK with sharing the obfuscated metadump (it contains
no file data, but may contain unobfuscated short file names, xattrs etc),
then compress it and send it my way, offline.

Thanks,
-Eric
