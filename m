IIRC setting up the shrinker in xfs_alloc_buftarg_common takes some
shrinker lock somewhere, and lockdep complained about a potential
deadlock between the locks that scrub takes if I don't create the xfile
buftarg in the scrub _setup routines.  That's why it's not created
internally to the xfbtree.

I agree that it makes much more sense only to create those things when
they're actually needed, but ... hm.  Maybe we don't need the xfile
buftarg to be hooked up to the shrinkers, seeing as it's ephemeral
anyway?  That would save a lot of fuss and ...

...maybe we could actually do it this way.  I'll look into it tomorrow.

Yes, lets move it to libxfs/xfbtree.[ch].
