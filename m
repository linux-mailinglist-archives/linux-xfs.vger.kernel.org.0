I think Chandan started looking into what it would take to port the log
code from the kernel into userspace.  Then xfs_trans_commit in userspace
could actually write transactions to the log and write them back
atomically; and xfs_repair could finally lose the -L switch.

<shrug> Ages ago Dave had a sketch to make xfs_{log,mount,inode}.h pull
in the relevant headers so that all the other source files only had to
#include at most three files.

I wish the kernel had precompiled headers, then it would make sense to
have one xfs.h file that pulled in the world and took advantage of
caching.
