~3,000 extents/s being removed, with reflink+rmap mods being made for
every extent. Seems a little slow compared to what I typically see,
but...

... probably not that unreasonable for pretty much the slowest
storage configuration you can possibly come up with for small,
metadata write intensive workloads.

Yup.

I think you'll find a limit at ~20,000 extents/s, regardless of your
storage subsystem. Once you take away IO latency, it's basically
single threaded and CPU bound so performance is largely dependent
on how fast your CPUs are. IOWs, the moment you move to SSDs, it
will be CPU bound and still take a minute or two to remove all the
extents....

Just script xfs_io to reflink random bits and bobs from other files
into a larger file?

Easiest, most space efficient way is to mdrestore to a file (ends up
sparse, containing only metadata), mount it via loopback.
