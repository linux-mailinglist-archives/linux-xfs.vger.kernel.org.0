I don't follow.. growfs always forced the log via the sync transaction,
right? Or do you mean something else by "change to flush the log?"

I thought the main functional change of this patch was to hold the
superblock buffer locked across the force so nothing else can relog the
new geometry superblock buffer in the same cil checkpoint. Presumably,
the theory is that prevents recovery from seeing updates to different
buffers that depend on the geometry update before the actual sb geometry
update is recovered (because the latter might have been relogged).

Maybe we're saying the same thing..? Or maybe I just misunderstand.
Either way I think patch could use a more detailed commit log...

Just a general comment..

Something related that isn't totally clear to me is what about the
inverse shrink situation where dblocks is reduced. I.e., is there some
similar scenario where for example instead of the sb buffer being
relogged past some other buffer update that depends on it, some other
change is relogged past a sb update that invalidates/removes blocks
referenced by the relogged buffer..? If so, does that imply a shrink
should flush the log before the shrink transaction commits to ensure it
lands in a new checkpoint (as opposed to ensuring followon updates land
in a new checkpoint)..?

Anyways, my point is just that if it were me I wouldn't get too deep
into this until some of the reproducible growfs recovery issues are at
least characterized and testing is more sorted out.

The context for testing is here [1]. The TLDR is basically that
Christoph has a targeted test that reproduces the initial mount failure
and I hacked up a more general test that also reproduces it and
additional growfs recovery problems. This test does seem to confirm that
the previous patches address the mount failure issue, but this patch
doesn't seem to prevent any of the other problems produced by the
generic test. That might just mean the test doesn't reproduce what this
fixes, but it's kind of hard to at least regression test something like
this when basic growfs crash-recovery seems pretty much broken.
