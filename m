No, just lack of immediate user demand + time to develop and merge code
+ time to QA the whole mess to make sure it doesn't introduce any
messes.

Yes.  We've found in practice that logsize < 100MB produce serious
scalability problems and increase deadlock opportunities on such old
kernels.  The 64MB floor we just put in for xfsprogs 5.15 was a good
enough downwards estimate assuming that most people will end up on 5.19+
kernels in the (very) long run.

That work reduces the internal transaction size but leaves the existing
minimum log size standards intact.

It's already written:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/djwong/xfsprogs-dev.git/log/?h=upgrade-older-features

I think the upcoming nrext64 xfsprogs patches took in the first patch in
that series.

Question: Now that mkfs has a min logsize of 64MB, should we refuse
upgrades for any filesystem with logsize < 64MB?
