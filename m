I think regular btree walks are partially vulnerable to loops in a btree
level.  A while back, you patched the self-referential case of a block
that points back to itself, but there isn't any robust checking of
loops such as:

A -> B -> A

Loops involving blocks from multiple levels are caught by checking
whether the btree block level matches what we were expecting given the
direction of travel.

AFAICT nobody's systematically fixed the problem for btree users that
don't attach a transaction to the cursor.  Without a transaction there's
no central place to collect locked buffers, so the buffer cache will try
to re-lock a buffer that the caller already locked.  We've partially
fixed this for GETFSMAP, but I think we're still missing that when
reading the bmbt into memory and for looking things up in dir/attr
btrees.

Scrub, however, protects itself from loops in the btree structure.  The
tree walking in scrub/btree.c finds sibling blocks by looking at the
next pointer in the parent level.  Each block's sibling pointers are
easily checked, so it'll notice things like:

     A
 /   |    \
B -> C -+  D
^-------+

When we load C, xchk_btree_block_check_sibling will notice that
C.rightsib doesn't point at D.  It'll set the CORRUPT flag, and return
from the btree walk.

Scrub will also notice corruption like:
     A
 /   |   \
B    C    B

by computing the keyspace covered by the records in each block and
compares that to corresponding key in the parent.  It also checks that
the records of each level are in increasing order.  Just in case B and
C are both filled with the same record.
