As already noted, I do think args.total could use some work. But unless
I'm missing something about the set of callers modified in the original
patch, I'd rather not tweak a core bmap mechanism in service to callers
that have no reason to use said mechanism in the first place.

And I know that such a change would affect legitimate args.total users
too and so still might be appropriate, I just think that's something for
a separate patch (even if in the same series)...
