Seems like a nice abstraction, particularly when you consider the other
use cases you described that should fall into place over time. A couple
minor comments..

Heh, I was going to ask what the expected behavior was with the various
!iop_sort() cases and whether we can really expect those items to be
isolated at the end of the list.

I'm a little confused on what these values are supposed to mean if one
of the two items is non-sortable. Is the purpose of this simply to move
sortable items to the head and non-sortable toward the tail, as noted
above?

I'd rather not change behavior here. This effectively overrides the
shutdown check in the caller because we get here regardless of whether
the transaction has any pre-commit callouts or not. It seems like this
is unnecessary, at least for the time being, if the precommit is
primarily focused on sorting.
