That's what I've implemented.  But it turns out -ENOSPC can of course
still mean a real -ENOSPC even with project quotas attached.  So back
to the drawing board - I think I basically need to replace the enospc
with a tristate saying what kind of scan we've tried.  Or we just ignore
the issue and keep the current global scan after a potential project
quota -ENOSPC, because all that cruft isn't worth it after all.
