Right, which is why I think it should be factored into function
calls first, then the switch statement simply becomes a small set of
function calls.

We use that pattern quite a bit in the da_btree code to call
the correct dir/attr function based on the type of block we are
manipulating (i.e. based on da_state context). e.g. xfs_da3_split(),
xfs_da3_join(), etc.

put:

struct xfs_da_state;

and whatever other forward declarations are require for the pointer
types used in the delayed attr context at the top of xfs_attr.h.

These are just pointers in the structure, so we don't need the full
structure definitions if the pointers aren't actually dereferenced
by the code that includes the header file.

Cheers,

Dave.
