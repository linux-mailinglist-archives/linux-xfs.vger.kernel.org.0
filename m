Yeah, I wasn't aware of that option. What Dave describes wrt to
replacing the on-disk whiteout inode with a dirent + in-core variant
sounds like the clear best option to me over the ones previously
discussed.

I agree. I think a two step process makes sense because we may want a
backportable fix around for the locking bug that doesn't depend on
replacing the implementation.

FWIW if we do take that approach, then IMO it's worth reconsidering the
1-2 liner I originally proposed to fix the locking. It's slightly hacky,
but really all three options are hacky in slightly different ways. The
flipside is it's trivial to implement, review and backport and now would
be removed shortly thereafter when we replace the on-disk whiteout with
the in-core fake whiteout thing. Just my .02 though..
