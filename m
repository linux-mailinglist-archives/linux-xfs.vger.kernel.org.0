This is the first time I've seen this show up on linux-xfs.

NOTE: I have a very strong suspicion that vger ate a bunch of emails
last week -- the V9 async buffered write series was sent on 16 June and
that never arrived here either.

How about this as a replacement for the first two paragraphs:

"During a reflink operation, the IOLOCK and MMAPLOCK of the source file
are held in exclusive mode for the duration.  This prevents reads on the
source file, which could be a very long time if the source file has
millions of extents."

Hmm.  I'm not sure this is ok -- reflink uses IOLOCK_EXCL to prevent
concurrent directio writes to the source file.  Certain directio writes
can proceed having only ever taken IOLOCK_SHARED (e.g. aligned writes
below EOF on a file with no security xattrs), which means that someone
could be directio overwriting the file contents while we're reflinking.

A direct overwrite of a block that has already been shared would prompt
the usual COW operation, since we set the REFLINK flag on both files
before we start the operation.  However, this introduces the possibility
that a racing direct overwrite could write to a block that is about to
be shared.  xfs_reflink_remap_extent is careful to increase the refcount
before mapping the extent into the dest file, but how do people feel
about the possibility of source file writes slipping in after we've
started the reflink process?

It feels a little strange to me that we'd allow direct overwrites to
continue during a reflink, even though we don't allow that for buffered
and dax writes, and I feel a little queasy about this.  I suppose we
could add an inode flag to signal that direct writes /must/ take
IOLOCK_EXCL, but yuck.

Anyway, moving along...

xfs_ilock_demote?

	if (src == dest)
		return;

	xfs_ilock_demote(src, XFS_MMAPLOCK_EXCL);
	xfs_ilock_demote(src, XFS_IOLOCK_EXCL);

That way we still get the xfs_ilock_demote tracepoint.
