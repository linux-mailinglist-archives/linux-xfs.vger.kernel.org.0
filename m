Erk, isn't that a potential log grant livelock too?

Fill up the filesystem with real data and cow blocks until it's full,
then spawn exactly enough file writer threads to eat up all the log
reservation, then each _reserve() fails, so every thread starts a scan
and tries to allocate /another/ transaction ... but there's no space
left in the log, so those scans just block indefinitely.

So... I think the solution here is to go back to a previous version of
what that patchset did, where we'd drop the whole transaction, run the
scan, and jump back to the top of the function to get a fresh
transaction.

Yes, that's a subtlety that screams for better documentation.
