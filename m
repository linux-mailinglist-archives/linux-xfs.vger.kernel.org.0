My first reaction is that this "keyfill" API name is .... awful.

From an API perspective, all we are doing is changing the
"has_record()" API that returns a boolean to return a tri-state - we
add a "partial" return to the "all" and "none" states we currently
return. The whole API doesn't need renaming - it's impossible to
work out what "scan_keyfill" iis actually intended to do, whereas
"has_record"  is very much self documenting....

Hence I think that the implementation of xfs_btree_has_record()
needs to change, I don't think the entire API needs to be renamed.
All that needs to happen to the higher level API is this conversion:

> -	bool			*exists)
> +	enum xfs_btree_keyfill	*exists)

Even then, the enum could be named for what it means -
xfs_btree_rec_overlap - with values for none, full and partial. At
this point, nothing above xfs_btree_has record needs to know
anything about whatever a "key fill" operation might actually be.

IDGI - this is an extent tree - there is no gap if the extent at
key2 starts at the end of key1. IOWs, this only returns "no gap"
if the extent at key 1 is a single block in length. I'll come back
to this...

Oh, does this assume that the caller has already created a key to a
nonexistent record in the BMBT that points to the end of the first
extent? i.e. that this method is being called with key1 being a high
key for the bmbt record (i.e. an end pointer) and key2 being a low
key for the bmbt record (i.e. a start pointer)?

If so, this API needs some documentation on how it is expected to be
used - at least name the two keys something more descriptive like
"high key" and "next low key"....

It occurs to me that what I'm actually doing here is reverse
engineering the design of this mechanism from the code because
there's no documentation in the patch or the commit description of
the algorithm being used to find overlapping records....

This "keyfill" scan operation is completely private to
xfs_btree_has_record(), which further indicates the higher level API
should not be renamed "keyfill"....

Better comment needed.

Ah, yeah, there's the high key -> low key implementation assumption.

Didn't a previous patch I just create helpers for these?

Oh.... patches in the series were threaded in the wrong order...

Hmmm. I'm wondering if we should have helpers for these sorts of
key comparisons.

static bool
xfs_btree_keycmp_lt(
	struct xfs_btree_cur	*cur,
	struct xfs_btree_key	*key1,
	struct xfs_btree_key	*key2)
{
	return cur->bc_ops->diff_two_keys(cur, key1, key2) < 0;
}

static bool
xfs_btree_keycmp_gt(
	struct xfs_btree_cur	*cur,
	struct xfs_btree_key	*key1,
	struct xfs_btree_key	*key2)
{
	return cur->bc_ops->diff_two_keys(cur, key1, key2) > 0;
}

static bool
xfs_btree_keycmp_ge(
	struct xfs_btree_cur	*cur,
	struct xfs_btree_key	*key1,
	struct xfs_btree_key	*key2)
{
	return cur->bc_ops->diff_two_keys(cur, key1, key2) >= 0;
}

Which then makes the code read a whole lot nicer:

	/* Did the record set go at least as far as the end? */
	if (xfs_btree_keycmp_ge(cur, &info.high_key, &info.end_key))
		info.outcome = XFS_BTREE_KEYFILL_FULL;
...

Not necessary for this patch, but I note there are a few places
where these sorts of key range/ordering checks are open coded...

Having read through it this far, this looks like it is checking for
two discrete keys form a contiguous range? Perhaps that's a better
name than "gap", because "contiguous" means different things for
different keys. e.g. extents vs inode records.

Huh. Is that correct? The high key for an inode chunk is:

STATIC void

        union xfs_btree_key             *key,                                    
        const union xfs_btree_rec       *rec)                                    
{                                                                                
        __u32                           x;                                       
                                                                                 
        x = be32_to_cpu(rec->inobt.ir_startino);                                 
        x += XFS_INODES_PER_CHUNK - 1;                                           
        key->inobt.ir_startino = cpu_to_be32(x);                                 
}                                                                                

Which means highkey->ir_startino (end range pointer) points to
low_key->ir_startino + 63 (start range pointer + inodes in chunk)

Hence if this "gap" API is supposed to be passed {high_key,
low_key}, then xfs_inobt_has_key_gap() is checking
(low_key->ir_startino + 127) against next_low_key->ir_startino...

... and this matches the BMBT code (as does the rmapbt code), which seems to
assume a high key (end extent pointer) is being passed as key1, and key2 is
a low key (start extent pointer).

Am I completely misunderstanding what the key gap API uses for
low_key and high_key? I am completely confused now...
