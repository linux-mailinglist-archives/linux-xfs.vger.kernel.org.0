From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

In commit 6ba125c9, we tried to adjust this fstest to deal with the
removal of the ability to turn off quota accounting via the Q_XQUOTAOFF
system call.

Unfortunately, the changes made to this test make it nonfunctional on
those newer kernels, since the Q_XQUOTARM command returns EINVAL if
quota accounting is turned on, and the changes filter out the EINVAL
error string.

Doing this wasn't /incorrect/, because, very narrowly speaking, the
intent of this test is to guard against Q_XQUOTARM returning ENOSYS when
quota has been enabled.  However, this also means that we no longer test
Q_XQUOTARM's ability to truncate the quota files at all.

So, fix this test to deal with the loss of quotaoff in the same way that
the others do -- if accounting is still enabled after the 'off' command,
cycle the mount so that Q_XQUOTARM actually truncates the files.

While we're at it, enhance the test to check that XQUOTARM actually
truncated the quota files.

Fixes: 6ba125c9 ("xfs/220: avoid failure when disabling quota accounting is not supported")
