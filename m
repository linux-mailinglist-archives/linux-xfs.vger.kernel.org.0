Hmmm.  Seeing as I just replaced XFS_BTREE_MAXLEVELS with dynamic limits
set for each filesytem, is XFS_DA_NODE_MAXDEPTH even appropriate for
modern filesystems?  We're about to start allowing far more extended
attributes in the form of parent pointers, so we should be careful about
this.

For a directory, there can be at most 32GB of directory entries, so the
maximum number of directory entries is...

32GB / (directory block size) * (max entries per dir block)

The dabtree stores (u32 hash, u32 offset) records, so I guess it
wouldn't be so hard to compute the number of blocks needed for each node
level until we only need one block, and that's our real
XFS_DA_NODE_MAXEPTH.

But then the second question is: what's the maximum height of a dabtree
that indexes an xattr structure?  I don't think there's any maximum
limit within XFS on the number of attrs you can set on a file, is there?
At least until you hit the iext_max_count check.  I think the VFS
institutes its own limit of 64k for the llistxattr buffer, but that's
about all I can think of.

I suppose right now the xattr structure can't grow larger than 2^(16+21)
blocks in size, which is 2^49 bytes, but that's a mix of attr leaves and
dabtree blocks, unlike directories, right?

I think we ought to do a more careful study of XFS_DA_NODE_MAXDEPTH, but
it could become more involved than we think.  In the interest of keeping
this series moving, can we start with a new verifier check that
(di_nextents < that formula from above) and then refine that based on
whatever improvements we may or may not come up with for
XFS_DA_NODE_MAXDEPTH?

Indeed, inode size is not a good proxy variable for extent count.
