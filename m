Indeed SLE12-SP3 was the last release to ship with DMAPI. The general
support has ended (although LTSS is still supported till mid-2022).

Either way booting/rescue from a non-SLE12 medium isn't supported, and
this cleanup is not going to be backported (LTSS only receives critical
fixes anyway), so it's probably safe to keep those fields always zeroed
in upstream kernels.

Perhaps even renaming those fields on xfs_dinode and xfs_log_dinode to
unused/pads would make sense, since they could be repurposed. Needs
though a couple of cleanups on the xfsprogs side too, so probably
outside the scope of this series (I have a bunch of patches to that
effect that I need to send sometime).

Regards,
Anthony
