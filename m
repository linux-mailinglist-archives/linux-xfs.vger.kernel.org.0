Hi,

I find that DCACHE_DONTCACHE doesn't work well.
If DCACHE_REFERENCED is not set, dput() can drop the inode successfully as
soon as all references are gone. By contrast, if DCACHE_REFERENCED is set,
dput() only decreases the reference count of dentry and don't evict inode.

Example 1:

echo abcdefg > test.txt
echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
xfs_io -c 'chattr +x' test.txt

In this example, we can say the DAX policy takes effects immediately as we
don't need to drop cache after chattr.
In this circumstance, DCACHE_REFERENCED is not set, and DCACHE_DONTCACHE
can drop the inode as expected.

Example 2:

echo abcdefg > test.txt
xfs_io -c 'chattr +x' test.txt

In this example, we must drop caches after chattr to make DAX policy
take effects. This is because DCACHE_REFERENCED is set, and fast_dput() will
return true, and then retain_dentry() have no chance to check DCACHE_DONTCACHE.

If this is the desired behavior, I can't understand the necessity
of DCACHE_DONTCACHE.

Hao Li
