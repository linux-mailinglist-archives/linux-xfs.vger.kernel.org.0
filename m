To be sure that we are on the same page.

Please, fix me if I am wrong. I am not that familiar with tracepoints.
It is a rather complex feature. Each tracepoint has a name, arguments,
fields, prints a message. I guess that the KABI aspects are:

    + name of the tracepoint
    + situation when they are triggered
    + names, type, and meaning of the parameters/fields
    + format and meaning or the printed messages

In compare, a potential KABI aspects of a particular printk format
(message) are:

    + situation when it is printed
    + format and meaning of the printed message

They clearly have something in common. I guess that this causes the
fear that the printk index feature might make convert a particular
printk message into KABI.


Note that the above summary is not talking about debugfs at all.
Is it really debugfs what made tracepoints considered a KABI?
Are tracepoints usable without debugfs?

It is clear that the debugfs interface might be KABI on its own.
There are many tools that use the interface to actually use
the tracepoints. A change in the interface might break the tools.
But it will be about the interface and not about the particular
tracepoints.

But I think that tracepoints are KABI even without the debugfs
interface. We could create 10 different interfaces for tracepoints
between the kernel and userspace. And all will break userspace
if the functionality of a tracepoint is modified.


I want to say. IMHO, it is is not debugfs what made KABI from
tracepoints. I think that tracepoints can be considered KABI on
its own. The tracepoints were created together with the debugfs
interface. They would not make any sense without each other.

This is not the case for printk() messages. They were always there.

The printk index is not an interface for using the messages.
It is like /proc/config.gz. The printk index describes what
pieces are available in the kernel.

IMHO, printk messages might already be considered KABI. There
are clearly monitors checking particular messages. The printk index
does not make any difference. Yes, it might be used to create a KABI
checker. But a KABI checker does not create the KABI. KABI
checkers exist only because something has already been considered
KABI before.

Or am I too naive or completely wrong, please?

Petr
