Subject: [PATCH] common/xfs: Execute _xfs_check only for block size <= 4k

fsstress when executed as part of some of the tests (e.g. generic/270)
invokes chown() syscall many times by passing random integers as value
for the uid argument. For each such syscall invocation for which there
is no on-disk quota block, xfs invokes xfs_dquot_disk_alloc() which
allocates a new block and instantiates all the quota structures mapped
by the newly allocated block. For a single 64k block, the number of
on-disk quota structures thus created will be 16 times more than that
for a 4k block.

xfs_db's check command (executed after test script finishes execution)
will read in all of the on-disk quota structures into memory. This
causes the OOM event to be triggered when reading from filesystems with
64k block size. For machines with sufficiently large amount of system
memory, this causes the test to execute for a very long time.

Due to the above stated reasons, this commit disables execution of
xfs_db's check command when working on 64k blocksized filesystem.
