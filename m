This probably invoked xfs_growfs

XFS cannot shrink.  This corrupted your filesystem by truncating the block device.

Because you chopped off 55g from the end.

Repair cannot read blocks that have been removed from the filesystem.

Failed to read a backup super beyond the end of the reduced lv.

Grow the lv back to 100% I.e. the size before the lvreduce and it’ll probably be ok again
