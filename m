Possibly. RT bitmap/summary buffers are marked by type in the
xfs_buf_log_format type field so log recovery can recognise these
and do the right thing with them. So it really comes down to whether
log recovery handles XFS_BLFT_RTBITMAP_BUF types differently to any
other buffers. Which, without looking at the code, I doubt it does,
so there's probably fixes needed there, too...

Cheers,

Dave.
