Likely a left over from adding debug traceprints...

You are probably right - I didn't look that further than "it should
be freed at commit time" and the flag name implies it is freed at
commit time.

Which, of course, then raises the question: "Which commit are we
talking about here?". But because it's RFC work at this point I
didn't bother chasing that detail down because the code worked and I
had other things to do.....

Yup, I did just copy-pasta at lot of stuff around here...
