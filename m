Oh, we're brute forcing AG reservation space? I thought we were
doing something smarter than that, because I'm sure this isn't the
first time I've mentioned this problem....

Aren't they cleaned up at unmount when the inode is inactivated?
i.e. isn't this something that should only be done on a unclean
mount?

ugh, I forgot about the fact we had to add that wart because we
screwed up the space reservations for finobt operations...

As for large scale testing, I suspect I turned everything optional
off when I last did this testing, because mkfs currently requires a
lot of per-AG IO to initialise structures. On an SSD, mkfs.xfs
-K -f -d agcount=10000 ... takes

		mkfs time	mount time
-m crc=0	15s		1s
-m rmapbt=1	25s		6s

Multiply those times by at another 1000 to get to an 8EB
filesystem and the difference is several hours of mkfs time and
a couple of hours of mount time....

So from the numbers, it is pretty likely I didn't test anything that
actually required iterating 8 million AGs at mount time....

As I mentioned on #xfs, I think we only need to do the AG read if we
are near enospc. i.e. we can take the entire reservation at mount
time (which is fixed per-ag) and only take away the used from the
reservation (i.e. return to the free space pool) when we actually
access the AGF/AGI the first time. Or when we get a ENOSPC
event, which might occur when we try to take the fixed reservation
at mount time...

Let's go catch it :P

Cheers,
