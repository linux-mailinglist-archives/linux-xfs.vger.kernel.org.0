Yeah, I thinks so - it is a physical space check to see if the current iclog
will fit between the tail and the location that the log thinks the
iclog is going to be located at.

That said, prev_block/cycle is the location that the last iclog that
was switched into WANT_SYNC state starts at. It's not necessarily
the location this iclog starts at because xlog_state_switch_iclog()
isn't always called from the same lock context that releases the
iclog (e.g. log force). Hence I think this debug check is racy and
potentially wrong.

It seems kinda stupid, really, because the iclog has it's physical
location in the header, too. It doesn't need the prev block/cycle to
be able to check this.

I note that l_prev_cycle is only used for xlog_verify_tail_lsn(),
but l_prev_block is also written into the iclog header in
xlog_state_switch_iclog(). It's not used at all by log recovery and
only for information prints in userspace, and I really can't see how
it is useful in any way for recovery. So this all really looks like
code that can be simplified by removing it and fixing
xlog_verify_tail_lsn() just to look at internal iclog state.

So I'd suggest there are substantial cleanups around this debug
operation which would also remove unnecessary runtime overhead.

Probably should be. I'll update the patch and sen dout a new version
once I've let the smoke out a couple of times.

Thanks, Darrick!
