Hmmm, thanks for the context!  What do you think about this revised
comment?

/*
 * The number of blocks per AG that we withhold from xfs_mod_fdblocks to
 * guarantee that we can refill the AGFL prior to allocating space in a
 * nearly full AG.  Although the the space described in the free space
 * btrees, the freesp btrees, and the blocks owned by the agfl are all
 * added to the ondisk fdblocks, it's a mistake to let the ondisk free
 * space in the AG drop so low that the free space btrees cannot refill
 * an empty AGFL up to the minimum level.  Rather than grind through
 * empty AGs until the fs goes down, we subtract this many AG blocks
 * from the incore fdblocks to ENOSPC early.
