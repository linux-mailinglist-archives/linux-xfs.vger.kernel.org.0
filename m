I probably shouldn't have resent this as the COVID fever set in.
Granted, I predicted (mostly correctly) that I'd still be a bit messed
in the head five days later.

block/char/special files... I guess those can just turn into zero length
regular files.

Would this NAK remain even if there were external corroborating
evidence?

For example, what if we read the dirents out of the first directory
block, seek out parent pointers in the alleged children, and confirm a
1:1 match between the alleged dirents and pptrs?  Unprivileged userspace
can certain create a regular file N that looks like a dirent block, but
it cannot create dangling pptrs back to N to trick the verification
algorithm.

(Obviously any patch implementing this will come much later in the
series)
