Hi,

The patch did not apply cleanly on the collection of XFS patches due for
Linux-v6.9. This was due to a trivial conflict with one of the patches that
was included earlier in the collection.

Can you please review your patch at
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/xfs/xfs-linux.git/commit/?h=for-next&id=9ee85f235efeebd5146c4436fb255d636e8063d6
and let me know if you have any disagreements.
