Ah, I didn't realise that had gone away in the quotaoff removal -
I've kinda had my head stuck in fixing the journal/log recovery
problems recently.  Thanks for pointing out something I missed.

FWIW, I just assumed it was a current TOT being checked because
c809d7e948a1 was introduced in 5.14-rc1 and that's the commit smatch
is, IMO, incorrectly blaming.  Commit 777eb1fa857e ("xfs: remove
xfs_dqrele_all_inodes") which is the one in for-next that removed
the XFS_ICWALK_DQRELE definition from the enum and so, under C90,
gcc will turn the enum from from signed to unsigned. But we still
build the kernel under C89, so it's not clear to me that the smatch
assertion is correct...

Perhaps there might be some improvements that can be made to smatch
to handle this better. Knowing what tree was being checked would
also help us here.

Cheers,

Dave.
