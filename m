Hi Leah!

I'll let the xfs developers comment on the individual patches.
General comments about stable process and collaboration.

Some of the patches in this series are relevant to 5.10 and even apply
cleanly to 5.10 (see below).
They are in my queue but I did not get to test them thoroughly yet,
because I am working chronologically.

To avoid misunderstanding with stable maintainers, when you post to
stable, please make sure to state clearly in the cover letter that those
patches have only been tested on 5.15.y and should only be applied
to 5.15.y.
I know you have 5.15 in subject, but I would rather be safe than sorry.

Luis has advised me to post up to 10 patches in each round.
The rationale is that after we test and patches are applied to stable
regressions may be detected and reported by downstream users.

Regressions will be easier to bisect if there are less fixes in every
LTS release. For this reason, I am holding on to my part 2 patches
until 5.10.120 is released. LTS releases are usually on weekly basis
so the delay is not much.

I don't think that this series is terribly big, so I am fine with you
posting it at one go, but please consider splitting it pre 5.16
and post 5.16 or any other way that you see fit when you post
to stable, but let's wait for xfs developers review - if they tell you to
drop a few patches my comment will become moot ;-)
