I'm not sure, I understand you correctly. Do you suggest to update the comment to "...if we are no longer over the space limit"  and change the code to `if (ctx->space_used < XLOG_CIL_BLOCKING_SPACE_LIMIT(log))` ?

I don't think, that would be correct.

The current push context is most probably still over the limit if it ever was. It is exceptional, that the few bytes, which might be returned to ctx->space_used, bring us back below the limit. The new context, on the other hand, will have space_used=0.

We need to resume any thread which is waiting for the push.
