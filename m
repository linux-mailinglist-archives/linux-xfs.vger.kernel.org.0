I don't think it is that simple.  Pretty much every device aimed at
enterprise use does not enable a volatile write cache by default.  That
also includes hard drives, arrays and NAND based SSDs.

Especially for hard drives (or slower arrays) the actual I/O wait might
matter.  What is the argument against making this conditional?
