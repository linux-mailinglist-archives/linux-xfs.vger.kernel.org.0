I wrote my first one in 1995 on Windows NT 3.51 using Installshield.

Hold on, 1995 is calling me. The application I was packaging used
ACLs. But the NTFS version created by windows NT 3.1 was
incompatible as ACL support didn't arrive until NT 3.51 and service
pack 4(?) for NT 3.1. Yes, I had to write code to probe the
filesystems to detect whether ACL support was available or not by
-trying to create an ACL-.

I guess you could say "been there, done that, learnt the lesson".

If you are filtering storage options presented to the user by
supported features, then you have to probe for them in some way.
And that means you have to consider that many option filesystem
features that applications use cannot be detected via mount options
checking the filesytem config. That is, there are features that can
only be discovered by actually testing whether they work or not.

Reality is a harsh mistress. :/

[snip the rest because you're being ridiculous]

Are you aware of ndctl?

$ ndctl list
[
  {
    "dev":"namespace1.0",
    "mode":"fsdax",
    "map":"mem",
    "size":8589934592,
    "sector_size":512,
    "blockdev":"pmem1"
  },
  {
    "dev":"namespace0.0",
    "mode":"fsdax",
    "map":"mem",
    "size":8589934592,
    "sector_size":512,
    "blockdev":"pmem0"
  }
]

Oh, look there are two block devices on this machine that are
configured for filesystem DAX (fsdax). They are /dev/pmem0 and
/dev/pmem1.

What filesytsems are on them?

$ lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT /dev/pmem0 /dev/pmem1
NAME  SIZE FSTYPE MOUNTPOINT
pmem1   8G ext4   /mnt/test
pmem0   8G xfs    /mnt/scratch
$

One XFs, one ext4, both of which will be using DAX capable unless
the dax=never mount option is set. Which:

$ mount  |grep pmem
/dev/pmem0 on /mnt/scratch type xfs (rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,noquota)
/dev/pmem1 on /mnt/test type ext4 (rw,relatime)
$

is not set on either mount.

Hence both filesystems at DAX capable and enabled, and should be
presented as options to the user as such.

And all this comes about because DAX is a property of the block
device, not the filesystem. Hence the only time a DAX capable
filesystem on a block device that is DAX capable will not be DAX
capable is if the dax=never is set...

Of course, this is just encoding how existing filesystems behave -
it's not a requirement for future filesytsems so they may use other
mechanisms for enabling/disabling DAX. Which leaves you with the
only reliable mechanism of creating filesystem and checking
statx(STATX_ATTR_DAX)....

Cheers,

Dave.
