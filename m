No problem.  Sorry I lost this email for 2+ months. :(

Yes, that's what it's supposed to do.

I think xfs_qm_scall_trunc_qfiles probably should be doing:

	if (xfs_has_quota(mp) || flags == 0 ||
	    (flags & ~XFS_QMOPT_QUOTALL)) {
		xfs_debug(...);
		return -EINVAL;
	}

Note the inversion in the has_quota test.  That would make it so that
you can truncate the quota files if quota is not on.

Why doesn't xfs/220 fail on the remove command?

Oh, because we patched it to filter that out, even though that's the
wrong thing to do.  That test really ought to remount with noquota and
then run xfs_quota -c remove $SCRATCH_DEV
