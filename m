Oh, so on Irix a program could call the kernel with *only* the handle
and no fd?  I wasn't aware of that, but most of my exposure to Irix was
wowwwing over the 3D File Explorer in _Jurassic Park_ and later an old
Indigo that someone donated to the high school. ;)

Ok, I'll drop the fsid checking code entirely.

For directories, I think the dotdot lookup is much cheaper than scanning
the attrs to find the first nongarbage XFS_ATTR_PARENT entry.
