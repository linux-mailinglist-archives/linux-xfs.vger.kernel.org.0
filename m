<nod> It's even less bad if you've maximized the number of free extent
records per EFI.

Each time we relog the EFIs, we log exactly the same records as before,
which means that all the blocks in the new btree remain the target of
EFIs until the repair completes.  If we crash before the end, log
recovery will free the entire half-built structure.

If we reach the end of the repair, we'll log EFDs for all the EFIs in
the btree bulkload reservation; log the new btree root; and queue a
bunch of extfree_items (which themselves log more EFIs) for the old
btree blocks.  Then we let dfops finish the extfree items, which deletes
the old btree.  If we crash during that part, log recovery will roll us
forward to the point of having a freshly rebuilt btree and no leaked
blocks.

That might be a useful optimization -- every time defer_finish rolls the
transaction, check the items to see if any of them have
XFS_LI_RELOGMEPLEASE set, and if any of them do, or we hit our (now
probably higher than 7) fixed roll count, we'll relog as desired to keep
the log moving forward.

...is there a sane way for dfops to query the threshold LSN so that it
could compare against the li_lsn of each item it holds?
