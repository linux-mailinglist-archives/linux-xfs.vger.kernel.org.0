There are few problems I noticed with the current workflow.

1. It will not scale to maintain this in git as more and more testers
start using kdepops and adding more and more fs and configs and distros.
How many more developers you want to give push access to linux-kdevops?
I don't know how test labs report to KernelCI, but we need to look at their
model and not invent the wheel.

2. kdevops is very focused on stabilizing the baseline fast, which is
very good, but there is no good process of getting a test out of expunge list.
We have a very strong suspicion that some of the tests that we put in
expunge lists failed due to some setup issue in the host OS that caused
NVME IO errors in the guests. I tried to put that into comments when
I noticed that, but I am afraid there may have been other tests that are
falsely accused of failing. All developers make those mistakes in their
own expunge lists, but if we start propagating those mistakes to the world,
it becomes an issue.

For those two reasons I think that the model to aspire to should be
composed of a database where absolutely everyone can post data
point to in the form of facts (i.e. the test failed after N runs on this kernel
and this hardware...) and another process, partly AI, partly human to
digest all those facts into a knowledge base that is valuable and
maintained by experts. Much easier said than done...

Thanks,
Amir.
