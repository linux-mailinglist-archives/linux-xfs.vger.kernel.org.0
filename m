Hi all,

This is a first (non-rfc) pass at the XFS extent allocation rework. This
series aims to 1.) improve the near mode allocation algorithm to have
better breakdown characteristics by taking advantage of locality
optimized cntbt lookups instead of relying so heavily on bnobt scans and
2.) refactor the remaining allocation modes to reuse similar code and
reduce duplication.

Patches 1 and 2 are cleanups to the small allocation mode fallback
function.  Patch 3 reworks the near mode allocation algorithm as noted
above and introduces reusable infrastructure. Patches 4 and 5 rework the
exact and by-size allocation modes respectively. Patch 6 removes the
unused bits of the small allocation mode and refactors the remaining
code into an AGFL allocation helper.

With regard to regression testing, this series survives multiple fstests
runs with various geometries, such as defaults, abnormally high AG
counts, and nonstandard block sizes. This also survives several days of
iterative, concurrent stress loads of fsstress, fs_mark and growfiles
(xfstests/ltp/growfiles.c) to repeatedly run a filesystem out of space
without any explosions.

With regard to performance, I have a user provided metadump image with
heavy free space fragmentation that demonstrates pathological allocation
behavior. An fs_mark test against this filesystem image shows an
improvement from 30-100 files/second to 600-800 f/s. On newly created
filesystems, I ran a filebench workload of 16 file creator threads
creating a mix of small (4k-1mb), medium (10mb-100mb) and larger
(500mb-1g) files and issuing fsyncs which shows comparable performance
and post-test free space properties with and without the patchset.
Finally, I've also run some ad hoc tests with fs_mark and fio (fallocate
and aio engines doing random writes) and observe no notable regressions
with these patches.

I may continue to experiment with filebench but so far I've not seen
anything that shows significant regressions. Let me know if anybody
would like to see test output or configuration details or whatnot from
any of that, or would like me to run any additional tests, etc.

Thoughts, reviews, flames appreciated.

Brian
