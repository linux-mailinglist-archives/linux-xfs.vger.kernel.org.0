Sure, go for it. Talking to Darrick yesterday, we were wondering how swap is
handled in the initramfs.  If you haven't mounted root, you don't have fstab
to find swap. But blkid *could* identify all swap partitions anyway. I doubt
it does that.

The other thing I wondered about was checking system memory, and limiting
repair to use that much with -m. If it's not available, would it fail more
gracefully than OOMing halfway through?

if this all feels to crazy, I'm ok with not going forward but it seems worth
investigating, because operations like this on the root fs can be a real pain.
