Eeeeyugh, this became kind of a mess.  These XFS_BTREE_ flags describe
btree geometry, are set in the bc_ops->geom_flags, and never change:

1. XFS_BTREE_LONG_PTRS
2. XFS_BTREE_ROOT_IN_INODE
3. XFS_BTREE_IROOT_RECORDS		/* rt rmap patchset */
4. XFS_BTREE_IN_XFILE
5. XFS_BTREE_OVERLAPPING

This one flag describes geometry but is set dynamically by
xfs_btree_alloc_cursor.  Some of the geom_flags (rmap, refcount) can set
it directly too, since they don't exist in V4 filesystems:

6. XFS_BTREE_CRC_BLOCKS

This one flag doesn't describe btree geometry but never changes and
could be set in bc_ops->geom_flags:

7. XFS_BTREE_LASTREC_UPDATE

The remaining flag actually describes per-cursor state:

8. XFS_BTREE_STAGING

Flags 1-5 can be referenced directly from geom_flags.

Flag 6 could be replaced by an xfs_has_crc call, though I'd bet it's
cheaper to test a cursor variable than to walk to the xfs_mount and
test_bit.  But this feels weird.

Flag 7 is set in geom_flags as it should be.

Flag 8 is really a runtime flag, so it can stay in bc_flags.

*or* I could rename geom_flags to default_bcflags and make it clearer
that it's used to seed cur->bc_flags?
