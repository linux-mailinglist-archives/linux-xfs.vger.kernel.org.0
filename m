Hi folks

Phase 6 is single threaded, processing a single AG at a time and a
single directory inode at a time.  Phase 6 if often IO latency bound
despite the prefetching it does, resulting in low disk utilisation
and high runtimes. The solution for this is the same as phase 3 and
4 - scan multiple AGs at once for directory inodes to process. This
patch set enables phase 6 to scan multiple AGS at once, and hence
requires concurrent updates of inode records as tehy can be accessed
and modified by multiple scanning threads now. We also need to
protect the bad inodes list from concurrent access and then we can
enable concurrent processing of directories.

However, directory entry checking and reconstruction can also be CPU
bound - large directories overwhelm the directory name hash
structures because the algorithms have poor scalability - one is O(n
+ n^2), another is O(n^2) when the number of dirents greatly
outsizes the hash table sizes. Hence we need to more than just
parallelise across AGs - we need to parallelise processing within
AGs so that a single large directory doesn't completely serialise
processing within an AG.  This is done by using bound-depth
workqueues to allow inode records to be processed asynchronously as
the inode records are fetched from disk.

Further, we need to fix the bad alogrithmic scalability of the in
memory directory tracking structures. This is done through a
combination of better structures and more appropriate dynamic size
choices.

The results on a filesystem with a single 10 million entry directory
containing 400MB of directory entry data is as follows:

Performance improvements on filesystems with small directories and
really fast storage are, at best, modest. The big improvements are
seen with either really large directories and/or relatively slow
devices that are IO latency bound and can benefit from having more
IO in flight at once.

Cheers,

Dave.
