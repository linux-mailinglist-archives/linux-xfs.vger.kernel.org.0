This series continues the work towards making shrinking a filesystem possible.
We need to be able to stop operations from taking place on AGs that need to be
removed by a shrink, so before shrink can be implemented we need to have the
infrastructure in place to prevent incursion into AGs that are going to be, or
are in the process, of being removed from active duty.

The focus of this is making operations that depend on access to AGs use the
perag to access and pin the AG in active use, thereby creating a barrier we can
use to delay shrink until all active uses of an AG have been drained and new
uses are prevented.

This series starts by fixing some existing issues that are exposed by changes
later in the series. They stand alone, so can be picked up independently of the
rest of this patchset.

The most complex of these fixes is cleaning up the mess that is the AGF deadlock
avoidance algorithm. This algorithm stores the first block that is allocated in
a transaction in tp->t_firstblock, then uses this to try to limit future
allocations within the transaction to AGs at or higher than the filesystem block
stored in tp->t_firstblock. This depends on one of the initial bug fixes in the
series to move the deadlock avoidance checks to xfs_alloc_vextent(), and then
builds on it to relax the constraints of the avoidance algorithm to only be
active when a deadlock is possible.

We also update the algorithm to record allocations from higher AGs that are
allocated from, because we when we need to lock more than two AGs we still have
to ensure lock order is correct. Therefore we can't lock AGs in the order 1, 3,
2, even though tp->t_firstblock indicates that we've allocated from AG 1 and so
AG is valid to lock. It's not valid, because we already hold AG 3 locked, and so
tp->t-first_block should actually point at AG 3, not AG 1 in this situation.

It should now be obvious that the deadlock avoidance algorithm should record
AGs, not filesystem blocks. So the series then changes the transaction to store
the highest AG we've allocated in rather than a filesystem block we allocated.
This makes it obvious what the constraints are, and trivial to update as we
lock and allocate from various AGs.

With all the bug fixes out of the way, the series then starts converting the
code to use active references. Active reference counts are used by high level
code that needs to prevent the AG from being taken out from under it by a shrink
operation. The high level code needs to be able to handle not getting an active
reference gracefully, and the shrink code will need to wait for active
references to drain before continuing.

Active references are implemented just as reference counts right now - an active
reference is taken at perag init during mount, and all other active references
are dependent on the active reference count being greater than zero. This gives
us an initial method of stopping new active references without needing other
infrastructure; just drop the reference taken at filesystem mount time and when
the refcount then falls to zero no new references can be taken.

In future, this will need to take into account AG control state (e.g. offline,
no alloc, etc) as well as the reference count, but right now we can implement
a basic barrier for shrink with just reference count manipulations. As such,
patches to convert the perag state to atomic opstate fields similar to the
xfs_mount and xlog opstate fields follow the initial active perag reference
counting patches.

The first target for active reference conversion is the for_each_perag*()
iterators. This captures a lot of high level code that should skip offline AGs,
and introduces the ability to differentiate between a lookup that didn't have an
online AG and the end of the AG iteration range.

From there, the inode allocation AG selection is converted to active references,
and the perag is driven deeper into the inode allocation and btree code to
replace the xfs_mount. Most of the inode allocation code operates on a single AG
once it is selected, hence it should pass the perag as the primary referenced
object around for allocation, not the xfs_mount. There is a bit of churn here,
but it emphasises that inode allocation is inherently an allocation group based
operation.

Next the bmap/alloc interface undergoes a major untangling, reworking
xfs_bmap_btalloc() into separate allocation operations for different contexts
and failure handling behaviours. This then allows us to completely remove
the xfs_alloc_vextent() layer via restructuring the
xfs_alloc_vextent/xfs_alloc_ag_vextent() into a set of realtively simple helper
function that describe the allocation that they are doing. e.g.
xfs_alloc_vextent_exact_bno().

This allows the requirements for accessing AGs to be allocation context
dependent. The allocations that require operation on a single AG generally can't
tolerate failure after the allocation method and AG has been decided on, and
hence the caller needs to manage the active references to ensure the allocation
does not race with shrink removing the selected AG for the duration of the
operation that requires access to that allocation group.

Other allocations iterate AGs and so the first AG is just a hint - these do
not need to pin a perag first as they can tolerate not being able to access an
AG by simply skipping over it. These require new perag iteration functions that
can start at arbitrary AGs and wrap around at arbitrary AGs, hence a new set for
for_each_perag_wrap*() helpers to do this.

Next is the rework of the filestreams allocator. This doesn't change any
functionality, but gets rid of the unnecessary multi-pass selection algorithm
when the selected AG is not available. It currently does a lookup pass which might
iterate all AGs to select an AG, then checks if the AG is acceptible and if not
does a "new AG" pass that is essentially identical to the lookup pass. Both of
these scans also do the same "longest extent in AG" check before selecting an AG
as is done after the AG is selected.

IOWs, the filestreams algorithm can be greatly simplified into a single new AG
selection pass if the there is no current association or the currently
associated AG doesn't have enough contiguous free space for the allocation to
proceed.  With this simplification of the filestreams allocator, it's then
trivial to convert it to use for_each_perag_wrap() for the AG scan algorithm.

This series passes auto group fstests with rmapbt=1 on both 1kB and 4kB block
size configurations without functional or performance regressions. In some cases
ENOSPC behaviour is improved, but fstests does not capture those improvements as
it only tests for regressions in behaviour.

Version 3:
- rebased on current linux-xfs/for-next
- various whitespace and typo cleanups.
- fixed missing error return from xfs_bmap_btalloc_select_lengths().
- changed git diff algorithm to "patience" for better readability.
- replaced xfs_rfsblock_t with xfs_fsblock_t.
- removed stray trace_printk() debugging code.
- Added assert to ensure we don't leak perag references out of the
  xfs_alloc_vextent_start_ag() iterator.
- changed trylock flag in xfs_filestream_pick_ag() to a boolean to reflect the way
  it is used now.
