Stray hunk from reordering the patchset. This used to be before the
removal of writeback from reclaim, so it needed to be called from
there. But that ordering made no sense as it required heaps of
temporary changes to the reclaim code, so I put it first and got
rid of of all the reclaim writeback futzing. Clearly I forgot to
remove this hunk when I cleared xfs_iflush() out of the header file.

Yup, good catch.

Yes. This is the way the code currently works before this patchset.
The IO reference used by the AIL writeback comes from
xfs_imap_to_bp(), and getting rid of that from the writeback path
means we no longer have an IO reference to the buffer before calling
xfs_iflush_cluster(). And, yes, the xfs_buf_ioend_fail() call in
xfs_iflush_cluster() implicitly relies on this reference existing.
Hence we have to take one ourselves and we cannot rely on the
IO reference we get from adding the buffer to the delwri list.

This was a bug I found a couple of hours before I posted the
patchset, and the bisect pointed at this patch as the cause. It may
be that it should be in the patch that gets rid of the xfs_iflush()
call and propagate through that way. However, after 3 days of
continuous bisecting to find bugs as a result of implicit,
undocumented stuff like this over and over again, the novelty was
starting to wear a bit thin.

I'll revisit this when I've regained some patience....

Cheers,

Dave.
