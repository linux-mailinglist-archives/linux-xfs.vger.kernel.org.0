You haven't addressed my feedback from the previous version. In
particular the bit about whether it is safe to block on ->ic_force_wait
from here considering some of our more quirky buffer locking behavior.

That aside, this iteration logic all seems a bit overengineered to me.
We have the commit record iclog of the current checkpoint and thus the
immediately previous iclog in the ring. We know that previous record
isn't earlier than start_lsn because the caller confirmed that start_lsn
!= commit_lsn. We also know that iclog can't become dirty -> active
until it and all previous iclog writes have completed because the
callback ordering implemented by xlog_state_do_callback() won't clean
the iclog until that point. Given that, can't this whole thing be
replaced with a check of iclog->prev to either see if it's been cleaned
or to otherwise xlog_wait() for that condition and return?
