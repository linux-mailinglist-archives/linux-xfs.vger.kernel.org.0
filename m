That's not difficult to do, but it'll break name obscuring in metadump
unless you know of a quick way to derive B from A and maintain crc32c(A)
== crc32c(B).

Granted I had mostly written off name obscuring in metadump on parent
pointer filesystems anyway.

Wellllll I was 10 minutes away from sending v11 with all of my changes
integrated, but I guess now I'll go rework the dabtree to use crc32c,
encode the crc32c in the parent pointer attr name, and get rid of all
the variable length value decoding.  Now that I just got rid of all the
intermediate patches with hash-in-attr-name.

Let's see if I can hammer that out in the next 15 minutes.
