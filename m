Umm ... but I can't actually do that ...

Looking back at xfs I realize that the filling of the super
block is meant to leave nothing allocated and set
sb->s_fs_info = NULL on error so that ->put_super() won't try
and cleanup a whole bunch of stuff that hasn't been done.

Which brings me back to what I originally had above ... which
we believe doesn't work ?
