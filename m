Correct.  In the case of the inobtcount upgrade, we know that the
inobt/finobt blockcounts in the AGI are zero (and thus wrong) right
after the upgrade.  If we made it a rocompat bit then we'd allow ro
mounts but we'd also have to be careful to prohibit a ro->rw remount,
at which point the admin gets a Big Surprise.

Why not just make the admin repair the system right then and there?
I mean, xfs_admin is already going to run repair anyway, so in practice
there shouldn't be that many people trying to push an "upgraded but
needs repair" fs at the kernel anyway.
