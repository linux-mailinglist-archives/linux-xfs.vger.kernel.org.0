Hi all,

This is v2 of the extent allocation rework series. The changes in this
version are mostly associated with code factoring, based on feedback to
v1. The small mode helper refactoring has been isolated and pulled to
the start of the series. The active flag that necessitated the btree
cursor container structure has been pushed into the xfs_btree_cur
private area. The resulting high level allocation code in
xfs_ag_alloc_vextent() has been cleaned up to remove an unnecessary
level of abstraction. Finally, there are various minor cleanups and
fixes.

On the testing front, I've run a couple more filebench oriented tests
since v1. The first is a high load, large filesystem, parallel file
write+fsync test to try and determine whether the modified near mode
allocation algorithm resulted in larger latencies in the common
(non-fragmented) case. The results show comparable latencies, though the
updated algorithm has a slightly faster overall runtime for whatever
reason.

The second is another filebench test (but with a smaller fileset against
a smaller filesystem), but with the purpose of measuring "locality
effectiveness" of the updated algorithm via post-test analysis of the
resulting/populated filesystem. I've been thinking a bit about how to
test for locality since starting on this series and ultimately came up
with the following, fairly crude heuristic: track and compare the worst
locality allocation for each regular file inode in the fs. This
essentially locates the most distant extent for each inode, tracks the
delta from that extent to the inode location on disk and calculates the
average worst case delta across the entire set of regular files. The
results show that the updated algorithm provides a comparable level of
locality to the existing algorithm. Note that this test also involves a
control run using a kernel modified to replace all near mode allocations
with by-size allocations. This is to show the effectiveness of near mode
allocation in general as compared to essentially random allocations.

Further details and results from both of these tests are appended below
the changelog. Thoughts, reviews, flames appreciated.

v2:
- Lift small mode refactoring into separate patch (retained review
  tag(s).
- Various logic cleanups and refactors.
- Push active flag down into btree cursor private area; eliminate cursor
  container struct.
- Refactor final allocation code. Fold xfs_alloc_ag_vextent_type() into
  caller and factor out accounting.                                                                                                                     
- Fix up tracepoints.
v1: https://marc.info/?l=linux-xfs&m=155742169729590&w=2
- Continued development (various fixes, refinements) on generic bits and
  near mode implementation.
- Added patches 4-6 to refactor exact, by-size and small allocation
  modes.
rfcv2: https://marc.info/?l=linux-xfs&m=155197946630582&w=2
- Dropped spurious initial refactoring.
- Added minlen functionality.
- Properly tied into near alloc path.
- General refactoring and cleanups.
