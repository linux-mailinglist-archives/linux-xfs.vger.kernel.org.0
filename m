Hello Dear,

I'm happy to inform you about my success in getting that fund transferred
under the cooperation of a new partner from Paraguay. Presently I'm in
Paraguay for investment projects with my own share of the total sum.
Meanwhile,I didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in
transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how.

Now, I want you to contact my secretary, her name is Ms Angela Ugorji and
her email address is: (angelaugorji945@gmail.com), ask her to send to you a
total sum of $2,500,000.00 (Two Million, Five Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars) which I kept for your compensation for all the past efforts
and attempts you did to assist me in the transaction. I appreciated all
your efforts at that time, that was why i decided to compensate you now.
Please contact Ms Angela Ugorji and instruct her on how to send the amount
to you.

Please do let me know immediately you receive the money so that we can
share the joy after all the suffering we undergo at that time. In the
moment, I am very busy here because of the investment projects which I and
my new partner are having at hand. finally, remember that I had forwarded
instruction to my secretary on your behalf in order for you to receive that
money, so feel free to get in touch with Ms Angela Ugorji on her email:
(angelaugorji945@gmail.com) and she will send the amount to you without any
delay.

Best Regards.
Mr. Micheal Jones
