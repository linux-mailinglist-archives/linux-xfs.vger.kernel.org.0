How? You state this can happen, but then don't explain how this
occurs. i.e. the commit message just describes the UAF failure and
the fix in the code rahter than how the failure occurs in the first
place.

IOWs, I have to spend a bunch of my time reverse engineering the bug
report to understand exactly how this UAF occurs, because it
certainly doesn't happen in normal operation.

i.e in normal operation, either (or both) the IFLUSHING lock is held
on the inode, or the inode is attached to and referenced by the
inode cluster buffer.

xfs_reclaim_inode() explicitly takes IFLUSHING and checks the inode
is clean (i.e. not attached to the cluster buffer) before starting
the process of freeing it.

IOWs, the inode cannot be reclaimed until it is unlocked and removed
from the inode cluster buffer, and this happens during inode cluster
buffer IO completion in normal operation whilst the buffer is still
locked.

The only way that we can do anything differently in reclaim is if we
are in shutdown conditions. In which case reclaim locks the inode
and calls xfs_iflush_shutdown_abort(). This locks the buffer, then
removes the inode from the buffer, the AIL and clears the IFLUSHING
state, then allows indoe reclaim to continue.

Omitted from the sysbot traces is this:

The filesystem is indeed in a shutdown state and is being unmounted.
However, the AIL is still running, which means unmount hasn't yet
got to reclaiming inodes - the AIL is flushed and emptied before
that happens. Hence this must be a race between background inode
reclaim and the xfsaild. Interestingly, some of the failures are on
quota inodes, which get released in unmount moments before we call
xfs_unmount_flush_inodes(). This implies unmount triggered the AIL
to run and is waiting in xfs_ail_push_all_sync() for all dirty
inodes to be removed from the AIL.

IOWs, the reason this race condition occurred is that unmount has
triggered the AIL to push -and fail- all the dirty inodes in the
system at the same time that background reclaim is trying to -fail
and reclaim- all the dirty inodes.

There's the underlying root cause of the race condition that is
resulting in the UAF bug being exposed - the unmount code
is allowing background inode reclaim to remove dirty inodes from the
AIL whilst it is explicitly pushing dirty inodes and failing them to
remove them from the AIL.

Indeed, xfs_unmount_flush_inodes() does:

        xfs_ail_push_all_sync(mp->m_ail);
        xfs_inodegc_stop(mp);
        cancel_delayed_work_sync(&mp->m_reclaim_work);
        xfs_reclaim_inodes(mp);

IOWs, it pushes the entire AIL to fail everything on it and waits
for that to complete, then stops inodegc, then is
stops background reclaim work, then it reclaims all the remaining
inodes.

Honestly, that looks broken. If there are inodes queued for GC, then
they can be dirtied and inserted into the AIL as part of the inodegc
queue flush. This is unlikely if the filesystem is shut down, but
it could happen in normal operation. We also don't need background
inode reclaim running here, because we are about to run a blocking
inode reclaim pass, too.

Hence If we change this like so:

+        cancel_delayed_work_sync(&mp->m_reclaim_work);
+        xfs_inodegc_stop(mp);
         xfs_ail_push_all_sync(mp->m_ail);
-        xfs_inodegc_stop(mp);
-        cancel_delayed_work_sync(&mp->m_reclaim_work);
         xfs_reclaim_inodes(mp);

We no longer have a vector for adding inodes to the AIL after it has
been flushed, and we will not have two background threads both
racing to abort/fail/free dirty inodes during unmount. I think this
needs to be done for correctness of unmount, regardless of the fact
it exposes a UAF issues elsewhere in the code.

Ok, so that's one problem, but how is background inode reclaim and
inode item pushing racing to create a UAF situation?

Again, I think that's a shutdown related issue. xfs_iflush_cluster()
does:

               /*
                 * Abort flushing this inode if we are shut down because the
                 * inode may not currently be in the AIL. This can occur when
                 * log I/O failure unpins the inode without inserting into the
                 * AIL, leaving a dirty/unpinned inode attached to the buffer
                 * that otherwise looks like it should be flushed.
                 */
                if (xlog_is_shutdown(mp->m_log)) {
                        xfs_iunpin_wait(ip);
                        xfs_iflush_abort(ip);
                        xfs_iunlock(ip, XFS_ILOCK_SHARED);
                        error = -EIO;
                        continue;
                }
......
        if (error) {
                /*
                 * Shutdown first so we kill the log before we release this
                 * buffer. If it is an INODE_ALLOC buffer and pins the tail

                 */
                xfs_force_shutdown(mp, SHUTDOWN_CORRUPT_INCORE);
                bp->b_flags |= XBF_ASYNC;
                xfs_buf_ioend_fail(bp);
                return error;
        }

The first hunk results in individual inodes being aborted, marked
clean and removed from the AIL. This then allows reclaim to lock
them and call xfs_iflush_shutdown_abort() on them, which then
serialises on the buffer lock.

The second hunk is where the buffer lock gets dropped. This runs IO
completion to abort any inodes that were previously marked IFLUSHING
and so skipped by the first hunk. This will result in them being
marked clean and removed from the AIL, hence also allowing reclaim
to lock and abort them.

At this point in xfs_buf_ioend_fail(), the buffer is then unlocked
and any pending inode reclaim will now make progress. For a UAF to
then occur a few lines of code later in xfs_inode_item_push() on the
log item, the xfsaild() -must- be preempted and not rescheduled
until the inode reclaim has done all it's work (which is quite a
lot, with lots of locking involved) and then have the rcu grace
period expire and have all the RCU callbacks run to free the inode
before it gets scheduled again to relock the AIL....

So, yes, we need to handle this case in xfs_inode_item_push().

More importantly:

Now I understand why the UAF occurs, it becomes obvious that
xfs_dquot_item_push() has the same log item UAF bug in it, too. the
path to it is slightly more convolutedi and does not involve RCU
freeing at all. i.e. dquots can be reclaimed asynchronously via a
memory pressure driven shrinker, so if xfsaild can be preempted for
long periods of time, the same race window exists where a flushed
dquot can be marked clean, reclaimed and freed before the AIL lock
is regained.

That will simply create lots of unnecessary noise in AIL
tracing. We do not want "push" traces on every item, we only want
them on the items that returned XFS_ITEM_SUCCESS. We have other
trace points for different return values, too, and they are often
much noisier than XFS_ITEM_SUCESS. e.g. inode cluster flushing can
have a 30:1 ratio of XFS_ITEM_FLUSHING to XFS_INODE_SUCCESS - we do
not want a "push" trace for every "flushing" trace, as that will
massively increase the number of traces emitted by this code.

Also, because I know understand how the race condition occurs, I can
state that the UAF doesn't just occur when XFS_ITEM_SUCCESS is
returned. The UAF is most likely to occur when the buffer is failed
because xfs_iflush_cluster() returns -EIO, which results in
XFS_ITEM_LOCKED being returned.

In that case, we run:

                case XFS_ITEM_LOCKED:
                        XFS_STATS_INC(mp, xs_push_ail_locked);
>>>>>>>>                trace_xfs_ail_locked(lip);

                        stuck++;
                        break;

See the problem?

If we cannot rely on the the log item being valid after
xfsaild_push_item() is called in shutdown conditions due to
pre-emption, then we cannot rely on it being valid for any of
the code we run after that call. Hence there are more issues than
just movign a tracepoint.

The tracepoints will need to be modified to take individual values,
which will need to be stored in temporary variables before
xfsaild_push_item() is called.

Comments need to be added to xfsaild_push_item() to indicate that
after ->iop_push is called, the log item may be invalid.

Comments need to be added to xfsaild_push() at the
xfsaild_push_item() call site that the log item cannot be referenced
after this call as it may already be free on return.

Comments need to be added to xfs_inode_item_push() and
xfs_dquot_item_push() indicating the exact line of code where we can
no longer reference the log item because it may have been freed.

And the unmount inode flushing operation ordering also needs to be
fixed...

Cheers,

Dave.
