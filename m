I'd prefer that we just do things in an order that doesn't invert
the locking. For a whiteout, we only allocate blocks when modifying
the target directory, and we do a check to see if that will succeed
before actually doing the directory modification. That means the
directory modification will only fail due to an IO error or
corruption, both of which have a high probability of causing the
filesystem to be shut down. Any error after the directory mod will
cause a shutdown because the transaction is dirty.

Further, the operation that will lock the AGF is the target
directory modification if blocks need to be allocated, and the whole
point of the "check before execution" is to abort if ENOSPC would
occur as a result of trying to allocate blocks and we don't have a
space reservation for for those blocks because we are very, very
close to ENOSPC already.

If we fail the xfs_iunlink_remove() operation, we're shutting down
the filesystem. If we fail the xfs_dir_createname(target) call, we
are most likely going to be shutting down the filesystem. So the
premise that locating xfs_iunlink_remove() at the end to make error
handling easy is not really true - transaction cancel will clean
both of them up and shut the filesystem down.

Hence I think the right thing to do is to move the
xfs_iunlink_remove() call to between xfs_dir_canenter() and
xfs_dir_createname(). This means ENOSPC will abort with a clean
transaction and all is good, otherwise a failure is most likely
going to shut down the filesystem and it doesn't matter if we do
xfs_iunlink_remove() or xfs_dir_createname() first.

And by doing xfs_iunlink_remove() first, we remove the AGI/AGF
lock inversion problem....

I think this holds together, but I might have missed something in
the tangle of different rename operation cases. So it's worth
checking, but it looks to me like a better solution than having
a bare AGI lock in the middle of the function to work around error
handling logic we didn't clearly enough about at the time (hindsight
and all that jazz)....

Thoughts?

-Dave.
