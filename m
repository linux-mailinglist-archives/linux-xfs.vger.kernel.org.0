It's kind of hard to follow this test, but it seems to be trying to
ensure that df output is consistent with du (statfs) numbers, before
and after creating and removing a 1MB file.  I guess it's literally
testing df itself, i.e. that it actually presents the numbers it obtained
from statfs.

AFAICT the difference in the failure is 1024 1K blocks, which is the size
the file that's been created and removed during the test.

My best guess is that this is xfs inode deferred inode inactivation hanging
onto the space a little longer than the test expects.

This is probably because the new-ish xfs inode inactivation no longer blocks
on inode garbage collection during statfs().

IOWS, I think the test expects that free space is reflected in statfs numbers
immediately after a file is removed, and that's no longer the case here. They
change in between the df check and the statfs check.

(The test isn't just checking that the values are correct, it is checking that
the values are /immediately/ correct.)

Putting a "sleep 1" after the "rm -f" in the test seems to fix it; IIRC
the max time to wait for inodegc is 1s. This does slow the test down a bit.
