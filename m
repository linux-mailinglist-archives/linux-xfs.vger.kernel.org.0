Hi Dave,

thanks a lot - those are the instructions I was missing!

Unfortunately I mixed up the results directories and the test baseline =
output tat goes to the /tmp directory, so I don=E2=80=99t have the true =
full diffs available, only what=E2=80=99s in the stdout log. In any =
case, here=E2=80=99s what I found:

Baseline
--------

On my vanilla kernel (5.10.76) I get between 18 and 20 test failures =
when running auto mode as you instructed. The affected tests on vanilla =
are:

generic/035 generic/050 generic/388 generic/452 generic/594 generic/623 =
generic/646 generic/670* xfs/031 xfs/033 xfs/071 xfs/154 xfs/158 xfs/177 =
xfs/185 xfs/506 xfs/513 xfs/539 xfs/540 xfs/542

Notable here is generic/670 which only failed in the baseline but not =
the patched kernel:

generic/670 10s ... - output mismatch (see =
/home/ctheune/fc-nixos/results/generic/670.out.bad)
     Reflink and mmap reread the files!
    +61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 61 62 62 62 62 62 62 62
     Finished reflinking

Patched
-------

On my patched kernel I get between 18 and 22 test failures. I=E2=80=99m =
listing only the ones not failing in the baseline:

generic/471
    -RWF_NOWAIT time is within limits.
    +RWF_NOWAIT took 0.2517 seconds

generic/475
     Silence is golden.
    +your 131072x1 screen size is bogus. expect trouble
    +your 131072x1 screen size is bogus. expect trouble
    +your 131072x1 screen size is bogus. expect trouble
    +your 131072x1 screen size is bogus. expect trouble
    +your 131072x1 screen size is bogus. expect trouble
    ...

generic/648
     Silence is golden.
    +your 131072x1 screen size is bogus. expect trouble

Also notable is that only the second run on the patched kernel contained =
additional failures compared to the baseline. The first and third run =
were =E2=80=9Cclean=E2=80=9D compared to the baseline.

I=E2=80=99m guessing that the =E2=80=9Cscreen size is bogus=E2=80=9D =
messages are due to me running the tests in a =E2=80=98screen=E2=80=99 + =
sudo environment. Leaves the generic/471 which doesn=E2=80=99t sound too =
bad, but honestly I have no idea =E2=80=A6 :)

Also, I=E2=80=99d be happy to pay back a bit by adding your instructions =
to the documentation or wiki (or wherever googling has a higher chance =
of finding them).

Kind regards,
Christian
