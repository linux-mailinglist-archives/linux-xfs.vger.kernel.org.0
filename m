This is where I get out of my depth. I added the drives to unraid, it
asked if I wanted to format them, I said yes, when that was completed
I started migrating data.

I didn't enter any XFS or disk commands from the CLI.

What I can tell you is that there are a couple of others who have
reported this alert on the Unraid forums, all seem to have larger
disks, over 14tb.
