For reference, I think this behavior is related to a couple patches I
posted a few months ago[1]. I reproduced similar behavior after some of
extent allocation rework changes and ultimately determined that the
changes I had at the time weren't really the root cause. The commit log
for patch 1 in that series shows a straightforward example that IIRC
doesn't have anything to do with finobt either.

The question I have is is this test doing anything a user wouldn't
expect to honor alignment? I understand that alignment is not
guaranteed, but I wouldn't expect to play that card unless the
filesystem is low on free space or aligned space in general (IIRC that's
something we check by adding the worst case alignment to the size of the
allocation request).

The example I had was a 1GB fallocate on an empty ~15GB/16AG fs (i.e.
allocation larger than a single AG). That is a corner case, but one I'd
expect to work. With regard to generic/223, what is it doing in this
case to "force the filesystem to drop alignment?" I think you could make
the argument that the test needs fixing if it's doing something that
legitimately risks the ability to align allocations, but I also think
you could argue that the test has done its job by finding this problem.
:)
