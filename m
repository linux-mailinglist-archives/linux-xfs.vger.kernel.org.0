Yeah. Time and knowledge are showing through here. I've been running
ENOSPC tests with the BMBT reservation part removed now for several
hours and I've haven't seen any issues as a result removing it. I'll
keep it running though to see if anything falls out, but my initial
impression is that we don't obviously need it anymore.

Cheers,

Dave.
