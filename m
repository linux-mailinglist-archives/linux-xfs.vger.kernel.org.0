Just above you wrote: "reservation wakeups on first insert into the AIL
are already handled by xfs_trans_ail_update_bulk()". My reply was just
to point out that there are no wakeups in that case.

I'm not following your reasoning. It sounds to me that you're arguing it
doesn't matter that the AIL is not populated from the current commit
because the push target should be much farther behind the head. If
that's the case, why does this patch order the AIL push after a
->l_last_sync_lsn update? That's the LSN of the most recent commit
record to hit the log and hence the new physical log head.

Side note: I think the LSN of the commit record iclog is different and
actually ahead of the LSN associated with AIL insertion. I don't
necessarily think that's a problem given how the log subsystem behaves
today, but it's another subtle/undocumented (and easily avoidable) quirk
that may not always be so benign.

Yes, but the point is that's not the only thing that can delay CIL push
work. Since the AIL is not populated until the commit record iclog is
written out, and background CIL pushing doesn't flush the commit record
for the associated checkpoint before it completes, and CIL pushing
itself is serialized, a stalled commit record iclog I/O is enough to
create "log full, empty AIL" conditions.

Yes, I think a separate series for CIL management makes sense.
