xfs_repair already skips the parent validation, this patch just
refactors it. What I was considering above is whether repair uses the
current dummy value of zero for any functional reason. If not, it kind
of looks like the earlier phase of repair checks the parent, sees that
it would fail a verifier, replaces it with zero (which would also fail
the verifier) and then eventually replaces zero with a valid parent or
ditches the entry in phase 6. If we placed a temporary parent value in
the early phase that wouldn't explicitly fail a verifier by being an
invalid inode number (instead of using 0 to notify the verifier to skip
the validation), then we wouldn't need to skip the parent validation in
phase 6 when we look up the inode again.
