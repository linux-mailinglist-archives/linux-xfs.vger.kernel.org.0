This experiment had a bug that was dropping some inactivations on the
floor. With that fixed, the numbers aren't quite as good. The batch test
numbers still improve significantly from the posted patch (i.e. up in
the range of 38-45k files/sec), but still lag the normal allocation
rate, and the large rm test goes up to 1m40s (instead of 1m on
baseline).
