--- Comment #24 from KN (kernel@nmitconsulting.co.uk) ---
Long time lurker here offering a potential workaround.


We experienced near identical kernel issues as mentioned here with a comple=
tely
different setup. We saw the issue on our OKD cluster (4.12 and 4.13) runnin=
g on
Fedora CoreOS (37 and 38). We had ~70 nodes with a specific workload profil=
e,
and of these, anywhere between 1 and 5 would run into this issue each night=
 on
our production cluster. These nodes were very IO intensive (druid
middlemanager/ingest nodes) but not database related. The persistent volumes
that were contributing the majority of the disk IO were configured as xfs. =
We
tried for weeks to reproduce this error but could not.

Whilst we have to accept this is a kernel bug and not an xfs bug, we *resol=
ved*
our issues by switching from xfs to ext4. Haven't had a single instance of =
this
error since we migrated our persistent volumes away from xfs.=20

3 weeks and counting and not a single failure.
