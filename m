I guess I was typing a bit too fast this morning -- "change to flush the
log to disk before anyone else can get their hands on the superblock".
You're right that xfs_log_sb and data-device growfs already do that.

That said, growfsrt **doesn't** call xfs_trans_set_sync, so that's a bug
that this patch fixes, right?

<nod> The commit message should point out that we're fixing a real bug
here, which is that growfsrt doesn't force the log to disk when it
commits the new rt geometry.

I think so.  Might we want to do that before and after to be careful?

Hmm, if you make a variant of that test which formats with an rt device
and -d rtinherit=1 and then runs xfs_growfs -R instead of -D, do you see
similar blowups?  Let's see what happens if I do that...
