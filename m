xfs_defer_{freeze,thaw} -> xfs_defer_{capture,relink} ?

D'oh.  Ugh, I hate this whole fugly hack.

TBH I've been thinking that perhaps the freezer function should be
capturing the unused transaction block reservation when we capture the
dfops chain from the transaction.

When we set up the second transaction, we then set t_blk_res to the
captured block reservation.  So long as the recovery function is smart
enough to set up sufficient reservation we should avoid hitting ENOSPC,
right?
