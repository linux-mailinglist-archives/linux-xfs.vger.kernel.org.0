Pushes triggered by xlog_cil_push_background() can complete leaving
the partially filled iclog in ACTIVE state. Then xlog_cil_push_now()
does nothing because it doesn't trigger a new CIL push and so
setting the cil->xc_push_commit_stable flag doesn't trigger a flush
of the ACTIVE iclog.

The AIL flush does not use xfs_log_force_seq() because that blocks
waiting for the entire CIL to hit the disk before it can force the
last iclog to disk. Hence the second piece of this patch is
necessary, and that is to call xfs_log_force() if the CIL is empty
(i.e. the case where xlog_cil_push_now() is a no-op because the
CIL is empty due to background pushes).


Cheers,

Dave.
