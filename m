I _think_ it was originally intended to prevent log shutdown
recursion when shutdowns trigger log IO errors and try to shut down
again.

I'd suggest that XLOG_FORCED_SHUTDOWN() is more appropriate in code
that has no reason to know anything about the xfs_mount state e.g.
the code in xlog_state_release_iclog() has a log and iclog context
and introducing a xfs-mount context to check for shutdown is a
fairly significant layering violation deep inside the internal log
implementation...

Cheers,

Dave.
