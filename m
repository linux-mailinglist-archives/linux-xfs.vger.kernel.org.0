Ok. The latter is more of what I'd expect to see if the objective is
truly to hard cap CIL size, FWIW. This seems more reasonable if the
objective is to yield committers under overloaded CIL conditions, with
the caveat that CIL size is still not hard capped, so long as the
documentation and whatnot is updated to more accurately reflect the
implementation (and at a glance, it looks like that has happened in the
next version..).
