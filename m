Ok.

I'll change the conditional to:

	if (XFS_DFORK_BOFF(dip) >= mp->m_sb.sb_inodesize)

Yep.  I guess I'll pull that out into a separate patch.

Hmm.  I think I've been through too many iterations of this code -- at
one point I remember the null check was actually useful for something.
But now it's not, so it can go.

Ok.

No.  xchk_validate_inputs will reject IFLAG_REPAIR on a V4 fs.  Those
are deprecated, there's no point in going back.

How about 'ðŸ¤·'?  That's only four bytes.

Or maybe a question mark.

Yes.  Changed to "Blow out dir, make the parent point to the root."

No, not really.  Will fix.

Yes.  That's not a terribly functional file, but users can do such
things if they want to pay for the cpu/metadata.

Yep.

I thought those were invalid, though apparently they're not now?
uidgid.h says:

static inline bool uid_valid(kuid_t uid)
{
	return __kuid_val(uid) != (uid_t) -1;
}

Which is why I thought that it's not possible to have a uid of -1 on a
file.  Trying to set that uid on a file causes the kernel to reject the
value, but OTOH I can apparently create inodes with a -1 UID via
idmapping shenanigans.

They're very clunky.

That's the only one, so I'll rename it to xrep_inode_dir_size and hoist
this check to the caller.

Woo, thanks for reading through all this. :)
