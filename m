And now the subject line for the patch is far too long.  it is
almost twice as long as the old one, doesn't fit on one line without
wrapping, and really doesn't tell us anything much extra. If you
really must say it's a whiteout issue, then:

xfs: Fix deadlock between AGI and AGF with RENAME_WHITEOUT

is sufficient. It's a summary - the above contains the problem, the
objects involved and the operation that needs to be fixed. Nothing
more is necessary. It needs to fit into ~60 characters so that
when you run git log --one-line the output can be pasted directly
into email without wrapping....

Cheers,

Dave.
