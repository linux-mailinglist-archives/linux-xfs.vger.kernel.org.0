Hi Amir,

My 2 cents on this topic (Assuming "delayed operations" refer to "deferred
ops") ... 

> Which other "delayed operations" already exist?

static const struct xfs_defer_op_type *defer_op_types[] = {
        [XFS_DEFER_OPS_TYPE_BMAP]       = &xfs_bmap_update_defer_type,
        [XFS_DEFER_OPS_TYPE_REFCOUNT]   = &xfs_refcount_update_defer_type,
        [XFS_DEFER_OPS_TYPE_RMAP]       = &xfs_rmap_update_defer_type,
        [XFS_DEFER_OPS_TYPE_FREE]       = &xfs_extent_free_defer_type,
        [XFS_DEFER_OPS_TYPE_AGFL_FREE]  = &xfs_agfl_free_defer_type,
};

IIRC, Deferred ops are meant to not violate the AG locking order.  If AG 'x'
metadata block[s] is locked then we can only lock metadata blocks of AGs
starting from 'x+1'. Transactions can return -EAGAIN when they detect that
they need to lock metadata blocks belonging to AG 'x-1' or less. In such a
case the transaction will be rolled during which the locks on metadata blocks
are given up.
