My thought is since bucket_index is now fixed as 0 except for the
determinated recovery path, so I think there is no need for any
exist callers or future callers to specify some bucket number.

The old formula is only used for xfs_iunlink_remove_inode() when
recovering, so old_agino won't be NULLAGINO but indicate the old
bucket_index as well (since it removes the head unlinked inode.)
That is the only determinated path.

I could do that instead, it means callers should obey more rules
to call this function. e.g bucket_index should obey "old_agino % XFS_AGI_UNLINKED_BUCKETS"
rule for the old way rather than passing any possible value.

but if we specify all callers do that, I think "if (old_value != old_agino)"
isn't needed here as well but instead add an ASSERT here since all callers
should know what they are doing now, and leave only some integral check here.

Just as I said above, this checks the bucket head validity instead
(since we get a bucket_index and the bucket head should be as
what we expect). It doesn't mean to check that old inode is what
we found on the list. So we could kill the original check in
xfs_iunlink_remove_inode() as well.

Anyway, I prefer this way since all callers won't know too much about
the bucket index. Since bucket index is much related to agino, it cannot
be specified without some rule, e.g. agino is 0 (just for a example,
should not possible), but a caller passes a bucket index 12. It doesn't
work so if we have a bucket_index argument, we have also to consider
bucket_index check in xfs_iunlink_update_bucket() just as the old
"if (old_value == new_agino) {" integral check as well. From this
perspective, xfs_iunlink_update_bucket() should also know the rule
as the proposed code does...

I could keep the old argument instead, that isn't too much for me.
I listed all my thoughts above.

Thanks,
Gao Xiang
