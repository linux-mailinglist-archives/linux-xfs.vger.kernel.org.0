I like the idea of moving the AGFL reservation tracking into the
transacation, though I'm not certain I understand all the particulars
yet.

In your mental model for how this might work, is the idea that the space
for the AGFL reservation will be added to the transaction once an AG is
selected for the allocations?  Even with this approach, it will still be
necessary to make some worst-case estimates about how much space might
be used in a transaction chain, correct?  E.g. the worst-case AGFL
equations from earlier in this thread still apply, it's just that the
space would be reserved _once_ at the beginning of the first
transaction.

For the rmapbt allocations, it doesn't look like code calls into the
allocator with XFS_AG_RESV_RMAPBT set.  The code that allocates rmapbt
blocks pulls a blocks from the AGFL and then deducts that from its
per-AG reservation.  I tried walking myself through a few examples, but
it looks like it's possible to do an rmap allocation in a dependent
allocation in a transaction even if the first allocation in the chain is
not allocating a rmap record.

To give a specific example: allocating bmbt blocks associate a rmap
entry with the inode for which the bmbt block is being allocated, but
the first allocation may well set XFS_RMAP_OINFO_SKIP_UPDATE, like
xfs_bmap_btalloc does.

It might be possible to use the oinfo in the xfs_alloc_arg structure to
determine if a particular allocation can allocate a rmap entry.
However, it also looks like allocating blocks to refill the AGFL can
itself allocate these blocks.  Is this a situation where we'd need to
audit the different operations and add specific attributes to their
existing xfs_trans_res to account for whether or not they'd allocate
rmap entries? Or is there a better way to do this that I'm overlooking?

Thanks,

-K
