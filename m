Ah, right, and we don't want sparse inode chunks to cross EOAG because
then you'd have a chunk whose clusters would cross into the next AG, at
least in the linear LBA space.  That's why (for sparse inode fses) it
makes sense that we want to round last_agino down by the chunk for
non-last AGs, and round it down by only the cluster for the last AG.

Waitaminute, what if the last AG is less than a chunk but more than a
cluster's worth of blocks short of sb_agblocks?  Or what if sb_agblocks
doesn't align with a chunk boundary?  I think the new code:

	if (xfs_has_sparseinodes(mp) && agno == mp->m_sb.sb_agcount - 1)
		end_align = mp->m_sb.sb_spino_align;
	else
		end_align = M_IGEO(mp)->cluster_align;
	bno = round_down(eoag, end_align);
	*last = XFS_AGB_TO_AGINO(mp, bno) - 1;

will allow a sparse chunk that (erroneously) crosses sb_agblocks, right?
Let's say sb_spino_align == 4, sb_inoalignmt == 8, sb_agcount == 2,
sb_agblocks == 100,007, and sb_dblocks == 200,014.

For AG 0, eoag is 100007, end_align == cluster_align == 8, so bno is
rounded down to 100000.  *last is thus set to the inode at the end of
block 99999.

For AG 1, eoag is also 100007, but now end_align == 4.  bno is rounded
down to 100,004.  *last is set to the inode at the end of block 100003,
not 99999.

But now let's say we growfs another 100007 blocks onto the filesystem.
Now we have 3x AGs, each with 100007 blocks.  But now *last for AG 1
becomes 99999 even though we might've allocated an inode in block
100000 before the growfs.  That will cause a corruption error too,
right?

IOWs, don't we want something more like this?

	/*
	 * The preferred inode cluster allocation size cannot ever cross
	 * sb_agblocks.  cluster_align is one of the following:
	 *
	 * - For sparse inodes, this is an inode chunk.
	 * - For aligned non-sparse inodes, this is an inode cluster.
	 */
	bno = round_down(sb_agblocks, cluster_align);
	if (xfs_has_sparseinodes(mp) &&
	    agno == mp->m_sb.sb_agcount - 1) {
		/*
		 * For a filesystem with sparse inodes, an inode chunk
		 * still cannot cross sb_agblocks, but it can cross eoag
		 * if eoag < agblocks.  Inode clusters cannot cross eoag.
		 */
		last_clus_bno = round_down(eoag, sb_spino_align);
		bno = min(bno, last_clus_bno);
	}
	*last = XFS_AGB_TO_AGINO(mp, bno) - 1;

This preserves the invariant that inode chunks cannot span sb_agblocks,
while permitting sparse clusters going right up to EOAG so long as the
chunk doesn't cross sb_agblocks.

Hmm, do you have a quick means to simulate this last-AG unaligned
icluster situation?

I wonder if we *should* have a compat flag for these cloud filesystems
just as a warning sign to us all. :)
