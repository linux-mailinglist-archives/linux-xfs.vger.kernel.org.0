Ok, so given all this, all I really want then is better names for
the functions, as "setup" and "get" don't convey any of this. :)

Perhaps xchk_setup_inode() -> xchk_iget_for_record_check() and
xchk_get_inode() -> xchk_iget_for_scrubbing(). This gives an
indication taht they are being used for different purposes, and the
implementation is tailored to the requirements of those specific
operations....

Cheers,

Dave.
