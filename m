I think it depends on the context. I don't think it's unreasonable to
expect certain paths to not want to process post-eofs perags. I don't
really like the placement of this assert tbh (with it being in a generic
helper) and the sb write verifier is probably not ideal context for the
check in a generic sense, but it does flag unexpected behavior when you
consider the higher level iteration is based on sb_agcount.

Ok, but what exactly are you referring to by "an iterator" beyond what
we have here to this point? A walker function with a callback or
something? And why wouldn't we have done that in the first place instead
of introducing the API wart documented above?

Will fix.

No, the reference count problems can still occur regardless of this
particular change.

Any loop that uses one of the sb_agcount based iteration macros in a
context that can race with growfs and doesn't check pag != NULL post
loop is not handling loop termination correctly. The sb_agcount check
effectively builds in an early termination vector to every such usage,
because we can't guarantee that pag == NULL when the sb_agcount check
causes loop termination.

IOW, the following usage pattern documented in the comment above is not
universally correct/safe:

	for_each_perag(...) {
		/* no early termination */
	}
	/* no perag check because no early termination */

... because for_each_perag() is not implemented correctly to guarantee
that pag == NULL on exit of the loop. This is a simple logic bug with a
simple fix.
