It's cleaned up considerably with hch's cleanup patches 1-5 of 2. ;)

Looking back at that, I realize that (provided nobody minds having
function dispatch structures that are sort of sparse) there's no reason
why we need to have separate xlog_recover_intent_type and
xlog_recover_item_type structures.

I combined them largely on the observation that with the exception of
buffers, log item recovery code is generally short and not worth
creating even more files.  224 is enough.
