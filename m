I have no idea what is the real upper limit on the number of rmap
records on a reflink filesystem -- as the rmap btree gets bigger, the
maximum number of records that one could need to store in that btree
gets smaller because rmap btree blocks cannot be shared and all have the
same owner (_OWN_AG).

But your reasoning seems correct.

Hmm.  That will increase the size of the btree cursor structure even
farther.  It's already gotten pretty bad with the realtime rmap and
reflink patchsets since the realtime volume can have 2^63 blocks, which
implies a theoretical maximum rtrmapbt height of 21 levels and a maximum
rtrefcountbt height of 13 levels.

(These heights are absurd, since they imply a data device of 2^63
blocks...)

I suspect that we need to split MAXLEVELS into two values -- one for
per-AG btrees, and one for per-file btrees, and then refactor the btree
cursor so that the level data are a single VLA at the end.  I started a
patchset to do all that[1], but it's incomplete.
