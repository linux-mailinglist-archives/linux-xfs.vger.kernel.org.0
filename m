In theory, yes. But like I said, I've made a bunch of assumptions
that this won't happen, and so without actually auditting the code
I'm not actually sure that it won't. i.e. I need to go check what
happens with items being marked stale, how shadow buffer
reallocation interacts with items that end up being smaller than the
existing buffer, etc. I've paged a lot of this detail out of my
brain, so until I spend the time to go over it all again I'm not
going to be able to answer definitively.

That's my nagging doubt about all this - that there's an interaction
of this nature that I haven't considered due to the assumptions I've
made that allows underflow to occur. That would be much worse than
the current situation of hanging on a missing wakeup when the CIL is
full and used_space goes backwards....

Cheers,

Dave.
