Yeah, I'm wondering that too.

FWIW my SATA SSDs the discard-max is 2G whereas on the NVME it's 2T.  I
guess firmwares have gotten 1000x better in the past few years, possibly
because of the hundred or so 10x programmers that they've all been hiring.

Also:
What is the end goal that you have in mind?  Is the progress reporting
the ultimate goal?  Or is it to break up the BLKDISCARD calls so that
someone can ^C a mkfs operation and not have it just sit there
continuing to run?
