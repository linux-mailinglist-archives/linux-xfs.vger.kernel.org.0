The kernel is not going to change that because we have started with this
before the s/+/-or-later/ happened. Tools need to read both.

For new stuff we should use -or-later methinks.

We wrote lengthy documentation and a long explanation on LKML. So what's
missing?

Maintaining it is easy. All new files need a valid SPDX identifier which is
documented in one of the licenses in the LICENSES directory. Preferrably
the SPDX identifier comes without all that boiler plate nonsense which got
copied and pasted, fatfingered and broken in the past.

We have layers helping with that.

The SPDX identifiers are maintained by the SPDX group which is independent
of us. We use them and we document how to use them proper so tooling can do
proper license identification.

Yeah, we should add a MAINTAINERS entry for LICENSES. Greg and myself are
going to be volunteered I fear.
