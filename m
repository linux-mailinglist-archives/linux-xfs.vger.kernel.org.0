Will do in the next version.

Honestly, no. I was debugging a test flake and I spotted that this was
the cause, came up with patches to address it, and sent it to the
mailing list for feedback. We did not want to merge it internally if
it's not going to land upstream -- with the rationale that making the
test more tolerant might be better than maintaining the patch
internally, although that is not ideal of course (as it can hide
actual failures from different sources).

Last attempt, just update_reclaim_state() (corresponding to
flush_reclaim_state() below). It doesn't tell a story, but neither
does incrementing a counter in current->reclaim_state. If that doesn't
make you happy I'll give up now and leave it as-is :)

Sounds good and simple enough, I will use that for the next version.

Got it.
