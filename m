Yes.

Not even that way. :)

You can't remount-ro while there are open-but-unlinked files. See
sb->s_remove_count. It's incremented when drop_link() drops the link
count to zero in the unlink() syscall, then decremented when
__destroy_inode() is called during inode eviction when the final
reference goes away. Hence while we have open but unlinked inodes in
active use, that superblock counter is non-zero.

In sb_prepare_remount_readonly() we have:

	if (atomic_long_read(&sb->s_remove_count))
		return -EBUSY;

So a remount-ro will fail with -EBUSY while there are open but
unlinked files.

Except, of course, if you are doing an emergency remount-ro from
sysrq, in which case these open-but-unlinked checks are not done,
but when we are forcing the fs to be read-only this way, it's not
being done for correctness (i.e the system is about to be shot down)
so we don't really care...

Cheers,

Dave.
