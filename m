Yes, I read that before I commented that I think it's a bad idea.
And then provided a method where we don't need to care about this at
all.

Yes: reading the code I pointed you at.

/**
 * folio_mark_dirty - Mark a folio as being modified.
 * @folio: The folio.
 *
 * The folio may not be truncated while this function is running.
 * Holding the folio lock is sufficient to prevent truncation, but some
 * callers cannot acquire a sleeping lock.  These callers instead hold
 * the page table lock for a page table which contains at least one page
 * in this folio.  Truncation will block on the page table lock as it
 * unmaps pages before removing the folio from its mapping.
 *
 * Return: True if the folio was newly dirtied, false if it was already dirty.
 */

So, yes, ->dirty_folio() can indeed be called without the folio
being locked and it is not a bug.

Hence we have to serialise ->dirty_folio against both
__iomap_write_begin() dirtying the folio and iomap_writepage_map()
clearing the dirty range.

And that means we alway need to take the ifs->state_lock in
__iomap_write_begin() when we have an ifs attached to the folio.
Hence it is a) not correct and b) makes no sense to try to do
uptodate bitmap updates without it held...

Whether it works or not is irrelevant: it is badly designed code
that you have proposed. We can acheive the same result without
changing the locking rules for the bitmap data via a small amount of
refactoring, and that is a much better solution than creating
complex and subtle locking rules for the object.

"But it works" doesn't mean the code is robust, maintainable code.

So, good optimisation, but NACK in this form. Please rework it to
only take the ifs->state_lock once for both bitmap updates in the
__iomap_write_end() path.
