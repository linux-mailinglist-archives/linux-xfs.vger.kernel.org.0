Yes, repair should definitely be proactive on this.

Yup, that's exactly why I suggested rounding up :)

Yeah. Which leads me to ask: should the kernel be updating the
secondary superblocks when it finds bad geometry in the primary, or
overwrites the geometry with user supplied info?

(I have a vague recollection of being asked something about this on
IRC and me muttering something about CXFS only trashing the primary
superblock...)

Cheers,

Dave.
