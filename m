/me wonders what problem is needing to be solved here -- if support is
having difficulty mapping fs uuids to block devices for $purpose, then
why not capture the blkid output in the sosreport and go from there?

That said, I thought logging the super device name ("sda1") and the fs
uuid in dmesg was sufficient to accomplish that task?

/me shrugs, doesn't understand, wanders off to more code refactoring...
