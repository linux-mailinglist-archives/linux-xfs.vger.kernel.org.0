Thanks! Will give it a try soon :)

(Solved in a couple of hours on a Sunday and all I had to do was mail
off a photo. As I always say about free software, especially while
feeling guilty about my own response times... you can't pay for service
like this!)

... and no I don't know why I didn't think to check the master branch
for obvious related reversions in fs/xfs. I'll do that next time before
bothering other people.
