Yes, I think some kind of fuzzy logic instead of the heavy weight flush
on supposedly light weight operations.

If the separate tags aren't going to disappear entirely: it would be nice
to move the counters (or any other duplicated variable) into an array
index by the tax, which would clean the above and similar code even more.

Note that there are two different read-only concepts in Linux:

 1) the read-only mount, as reflected in the vfsmount.  For this your
    description above is spot-on
 2) the read-only superblock, as indicated by the sb flag.  This is
    usually due to an read-only block device, and we must not write
    anything to the device, as that typically will lead to an I/O error.
