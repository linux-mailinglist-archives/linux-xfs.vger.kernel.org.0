xfs/030 is weird, I've found it long time ago.

If I do a 'whole disk mkfs' (_scratch_mkfs_xfs), before this sized mkfs:

  _scratch_mkfs_xfs $DSIZE >/dev/null 2>&1

Everything looks clear, and test pass. I can't send a patch to do this,
because I don't know the reason.

I'm not familiar with xfs_repair so much, so I don't know what happens
underlying. I suppose the the part after the $DSIZE affect the xfs_repair,
but I don't know why the wipefs can cause that, wipefs only erase 4 bytes
at the beginning.

Darrick, do you know more about that?

Thanks,
Zorro

I'm not worried about it too much, due to it always 'not run' and never
fails:)

xfs/148 [not run] parallel repair binary xfs_prepair64 is not installed
xfs/149 [not run] parallel repair binary xfs_prepair is not installed
Ran: xfs/148 xfs/149
Not run: xfs/148 xfs/149
Passed all 2 tests
