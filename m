Yeah, that seems reasonable to me. I don't think it's difficult to
handle - just set the setaside to maximum at mount time, then as we
read in AGFs we replace the maximum setaside for that AG with the
actual btree block usage. If we hit ENOSPC, then we can read in the
uninitialised pags to reduce the setaside from the maximum to the
actual values and return that free space back to the global pool...

It sounds like we have a solid plan to address the AG header access
at mount time, adding this code now doesn't make anything worse,
nor does it appear to prevent us from fixing the AG header access
problem in the future. So I'm happy for this fix to go ahead as it
stands.

Cheers,

Dave.
