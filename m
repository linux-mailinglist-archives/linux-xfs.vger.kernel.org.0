:-)  Wouldnt it make it easier though if people pushed a corresponding 
"xfsprogs: set name" that's already been applied/compiled and 
(hopefully) tested?  That way when the user space side needs updating, 
patches can just be applied without one person having to work through 
all the ports?  And then people could sort of cherry pick what they need 
off the list while the user space side is still between cycles.  I 
realize this would generate a lot more traffic on the mailing list, but 
it seems like a reasonable way that people could help address this 
bottle neck.

I think I must have redone the userspace side of the delayed attr series 
over a dozen times, and there's a few patches that are not perfect 
mirrors of their kernel space counter parts.  Because some changes 
affect code not present in the kernel space side, now all that needs 
updating too for the set as a whole to really work.  It kinda seems like 
submitting just the kernel space side is still only half the set.  Not 
sure how many other people run into that, but I suspect I'm likely not 
the first?
