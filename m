I don't think we need to have code comments to explain why some other
code doesn't do something or doesn't exist. This seems like something
that should stick to the commit log description (between this patch and
the future patch that removes the historical behavior). IOW, I'd just
drop that second paragraph.

Otherwise (and modulo my previous thoughts on the bio) LGTM:
