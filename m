These aren't problems that need to be solved. These are "solutions"
posed as a questions.

Let's look at 1):

I disagree with both these "it is easier" assertions.

That same argument was made for splitting up MAINTAINERS in the
kernel tree, which sees far more concurrent changes than a test
config file would in fstests. The "split files are easier to
use/maintain" argument wasn't persuasive there, and I don't really
see that this is any different. We just aren't going to have a lot
of change to common test configs once the initial set is defined
and committed...

Again, it is no more difficult to add a new section config for a new
btrfs config to a configs/default.config file than it is to add it
to configs/default-btrfs.config.

The config sections are already namespaced by naming convention
(i.e. ["FSTYP"-"config description"]), so the argument that we need
to add a config namespace to an already namespaced config setup
to make it "easier to manage" isn't convincing - it's a subjective
opinion.

I'm saying subjective analysis is insufficient justification for a
change, because the subjective analysis of the situation done by
different people can result in (and often does) completely opposed
stances. Both subjective opinions are as valid as each other, so the
only way to address the situation is to look at the technical merits
of the proposal. The requires all parties to understand the problem
that needs to be solved.

I still don't know what problem is solved by shipping lots of config
files and additional code, build infrastructure and CLI interfaces
to address.  I'm probably still missing something important, but I'm
not going to learn what that might be from subjective opinion
statements like "X will be easier if ...."

Well, yes, and therein lies the problem with this approach. Where do
custom configs go? Are you proposing that everyone with custom
configs will be forced to run or manage fstests in some new,
different way?

<looks at code providec>

Yup, and now this is all ignored and doesn't work because the test
machine has a custom config setup in <hostname>.config and that
overrides using configs/all-fs.config.

That is not ideal.

Of course, we could add a "configs/local.configs" file for local
configs that get included via the make rule.

However, now we need both a per-machine configs/local.config to be
exist or be distributed at the fstests source code update time (i.e.
before build), as well as also needing an additional static
per-machine configs/devices.config to be defined before fstests is
run.

This is much more convoluted that setting up in
configs/<hostname>.config once at machine setup time and almost
never having to touch it again. The build time requirement also
makes it hard to install packaged fstests (e.g. in a rpm or deb)
because now there's a configure and build step needed after package
installation...

Part of the problem is that you've treated the fstests-provided
section definitions as exclusive w.r.t. local custom config
definitions.  i.e. We can't have both fstest defined sections and
custom sections at the same time.

This restriction essentially forces anyone with a custom config to
have to copy the built config file into their custom config file so
that they can run both fstests provided and custom configs in the
same test run.

That is not ideal.

Maybe this is an oversight, but I still don't know what problem you
are trying to solve and so I can't make any judgement on whether it
is a simple mistake or intended behaviour...

-Dave.
