I understand why the drop_cache operation is necessary. Thanks.

BTW, even normal user becomes to able to change DAX flag for an inode,
drop_cache operation still requires root permission, right?

So, if kernel have a feature for normal user can operate drop cache for 
"a inode" with
its permission, I think it improve the above limitation, and
we would like to try to implement it recently.

Do you have any opinion making such feature?
(Agree/opposition, or any other comment?)

Thanks,
