Back when I wrote that code (circa 2007, IIRC), that was actually
correct according to the reservations that were made when freeing
an extent at ENOSPC.

We needed 4 blocks for the AGFL fixup to always succeed  - 2 blocks
for each BNO and CNT btrees, and, IIRC, the extent free reservation
was just 4 blocks at that time. Hence the 4+4 value.

However, you are right that rmap also adds another per-ag btree that
is allocated from the agfl and that set_aside() should be taking
that into accout. That said, I think that xfs_alloc_min_freelist()
might even be wrong by just adding 2 blocks to the AGFL for the
rmapbt.

That is, at ENOSPC the rmapbt can be a *big* btree. It's not like
the BNO and CNT btrees which are completely empty at that point in
time; the RMAP tree could be one level below max height, and freeing
a single block could split a rmap rec and trigger a full height RMAP
split.

So the minimum free list length in that case is 2 + 2 + MAX_RMAP_HEIGHT.

Yes, we've changed the BMBT reservations in the years since that
code was written to handle max height reservations correctly, too.
So, like the RMAP btree reservation, we probably should be reserving
MAX_BMAP_HEIGHT in the set-aside calculation.

refcount btree space is handled by the ag_resv code and blocks
aren't allocated from the AGFL, so I don't think we need to take
taht into account for xfs_alloc_set_aside().

*nod*, but with the proviso that xfs_alloc_min_freelist() doesn't
appear to be correct, either....

Also, that's a fixed value for the physical geometry of the
filesystem, so it should be calculated once at mount time and stored
in the xfs_mount (and only updated if needed at growfs time)...

Yeah, macros wrapping a variable or repeated constant calculation
are bad, and it's something we've been cleaning up for a long
time...

Cheers,

Dave.
