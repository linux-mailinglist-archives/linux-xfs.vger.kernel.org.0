Yes. Effectively inodegc workers capture the errors from
xfs_inactive(), and the next xfs_inode_flush() call will gather the
errors, clear them and report them to the caller. It's then up to
the caller to decide what to do with an error from
xfs_inode_flush()...

Yes. That is the largely the what I've tried to do. The main thing
was to make the unlinked inode error reporting work, and having
other paths (like remount,ro) also be able to fail and propagate
errors is a bonus.

Thanks!
