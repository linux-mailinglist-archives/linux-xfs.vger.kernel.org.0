Already unreviewable at 45, and I've only gotten through 2/3 of it.

Here's something I haven't previously shared with all of you: Last cycle
when we were going around and around on the ENOSPC/EDQUOT retry loop
patches (which exploded from 13 to 41 patches) it was /very/ stressful
to have to rework this and that part every day and a half for almost
three weeks.

When I get a patchset ready for submission, I export the patches from my
development branch into a topic branch based off the latest -rc.  Every
time anyone makes a suggestion, I update the topic branch and send that
to the fstests "cloud" to see if it broke anything.  If it succeeds, I
push it to k.org and resubmit.

The part that's less obvious is the fact that rebasing is /not/ that
simple.  Next I integrate the changes into my development tree and
rebase everything that comes after /that/ to make sure it doesn't
interfere with my longer term development goals.  Sometimes this is
easy, sometimes this takes an entire day to work out the warts.
Then I send that to the fstests "cloud".  This rebase is particularly
painful because every change that everyone makes to inode
initialization collides with a rework of inode initialization that I've
been working on in preparation for metadata directory trees.

The part that's even /less/ obvious than that is that once the
development tree tests ok, then I do the same to my xfsprogs dev tree to
make sure that nothing broke.  Frequently there are ABI or cognitive
mismatches between kernel and userspace such that the build breaks, and
then I have to patch the two kernel trees and re-run everything.

So, that's really stressful for me because a minor tweak to an interface
can result in an enormous amount of work.  And I reject the argument
that I could just rebase less frequently -- Dave does that, which means
that any time he hears that one of his topic branches is being asked
about, he has to spend weeks rebasing the whole mess to the latest
upstream.  Maybe that works for him, but for me, I would hate that even
more than doing a daily rebase.

Add to that the fact that vger has been a total delivery sh*tshow all
year.  Now in addition to feeling disconnected from my family and
friends, I also feel disconnected from work people too.  This really did
nearly push me over the edge three weeks ago.

Please remember, one of the big advantages of our open development
processes is that we /do/ accept code with warty (but functional)
interfaces now, and we can clean them up later.  This is (IMHO) a good
stress-reduction tactic, because each of us (ideally) should concentrate
on getting the core algorithms right, and not focusing on rebasing code
and smoothing over the same d*** merge conflicts over and over.

Yes, it's true that people think that a maintainer's only real power is
to say 'no' in the hopes of forcing developers to fix everything now
because they can't trust that a dev will ever come back with the
promised updates, but I reject that 110%.  I'm not going anywhere, and I
/do/ trust that when the rest of you say that you'll be back with wart
remover, you will.

So here's what I want to know: Do Dave's changes to the log force APIs
introduce broken behavior?  If the interfaces are so confusing that
/none/ of us understand it, can we introduce the appropriate wrappers
and documentation so that the rest of us plugging away at the rest of
the system can only call it the supported ways to achieve any of the
supported outcomes?

I'm willing to accept a bunch of documentation and "trivial" wrappers
for the rest of us as a shoofly to enable the rest of the xfs developers
to keep moving around a messy slow-moving log restructuring without
falling into a work pit.

However, it's been difficult for me to check that without being able to
reference a branch to see that at least the end result looks sane.  That
was immensely helpful for reviewing Allison's deferred xattrs series.

(TLDR: git branch plz)

The other way to ease my fears, of course, would be to submit a ton of
fstests to examine the log behavior for correctness, but that's
difficult to pull off when the control surface is the userspace ABI.

You mean there's even more beyond the 45 already on the list? /groan/
