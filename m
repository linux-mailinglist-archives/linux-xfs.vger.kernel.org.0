It's not clear to me if you're reporting that feature upgrades
spuriously report this "Conversion failed ..." message (i.e., feature
upgrade succeeded, but repair found and fixed things expected to be
problems due to the feature upgrade), or that this error is reported if
there is something independently wrong with the fs. If the former, that
seems like a bug. If the latter, I think that's reasonable/expected
behavior.

IMO, the fact that the feature upgrade runs xfs_repair is an
implementation detail. There's no guarantee that repair might always be
necessary for this operation or that it would find/fix other issues when
running for the purpose of a feature upgrade. For that reason, I don't
think it makes a whole lot of sense to try and pipe detailed repair
messages through xfs_admin (as opposed to generically informative
messages like "upgrade succeeded," "upgrade failed," "filesystem
corrupt?" etc). Just my .02, of course.
