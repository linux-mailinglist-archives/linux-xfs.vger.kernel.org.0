Intent replay creates non-intent log items (like buffers or inodes) that
are added to the AIL with an LSN higher than last_lsn.  I suppose it
would be possible to break log recovery if an intent's iop_recover
method immediately logged a new intent and returned EAGAIN to roll the
transaction, but none of them do that; and I think the ASSERT you moved
would detect such a thing.
