Sorry for the confusion, I found this issue in Linux 5.10, so the assertion
on nlink is in xfs_remove(). I've reproduced it on the mainline kernel, the
probability of this problem is very low and it is very difficult to reproduce.
The mainline kernel assertion error prints is as follows:

XFS: Assertion failed: VFS_I(ip)->i_nlink >= 2, file: fs/xfs/xfs_inode.c, line: 2452

Thanks,
