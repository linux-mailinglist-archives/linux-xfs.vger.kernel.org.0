I was just referring to the insinuation that we have to maintain such
debug logic because a test exists that wants it. Clearly that's why it
exists. ;)

But is it worth maintaining test specific debug logic in an application
just to confirm that particular feature bit upgrades actually set the
bit? It seems sufficient to me to test that needsrepair functionality
works as expected and that individual feature upgrade works as well.

Given the discussion on patch 7, perhaps it makes more sense to at least
defer this sort of injection mechanism until we have a scheme for
generic needsrepair usage worked out for xfs_repair? I am wondering if
there's a way to make repair fail without requiring additional code, but
if not and we do require some sort of injection mode, I suspect we might
end up better served by something more generic (i.e. capable of failures
at random points) rather than defining a command line option
specifically for a particular fstest..
