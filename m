THis host stuff should be checked in xfs_fs_fill_super(), right?

i.e. it's not really part of the superblock validation, but checking
if the host can actually run this filesystem. That's what we do in
xfs_fc_fill_super(), such as the max file size support, whether
mount options are valid for the superblock config (e.g. reflink vs
rt) and so on. IOWs, these aren't corruption verifiers, just config
checks, so we should put them with all the other config checks we do
at mount time...

i.e. call it something like xfs_fs_validate_sb_config() and move all
the config and experimental function checks into it, call it only
from xfs_fs_fill_super() once we've already read in and validated
the superblock is within the bounds defined by the on-disk format.

Oh, and just another thing: can we rename all the "xfs_fc_*"
functions in xfs_super.c back to xfs_fs_*? I'm getting tired of not
being about to find the superblock init functions in xfs_super.c
(e.g. xfs_fs_fill_super()) with grep or cscope because they have a
whacky, one-off namespace now...

Cheers,

Dave.
