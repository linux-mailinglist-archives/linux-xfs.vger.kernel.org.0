So I think I follow what you're describing wrt to the xfsaild delay, but
what I'm not clear on is what changing this behavior actually fixes.
IOW, if the xfsaild is cycling through and finding mostly stuck items,
then we see a delay because of the time spent in a log force (because of
those stuck items), what's the advantage to issue an async force over a
sync force? Won't xfsaild effectively continue to spin on these stuck
items until the log force completes, regardless?

Is the issue not so much the throughput of xfsaild, but just the fact
that the task stalls are large enough to cause other problems? I.e., the
comment you add down in the xfsaild code refers to tail pinning causing
reservation stalls. IOW, the purpose of this patch is then to keep
xfsaild sleeps to a predictable latency to ensure we come around again
quickly enough to keep the tail moving forward (even though the AIL
itself might remain in a state where the majority of items are stuck).
Yes?

Hm, so now we have sync and async log force and sync and async CIL push.
A log force always requires a sync CIL push and commit record submit;
the difference is simply whether or not we wait on commit record I/O
completion. The sync CIL push drains the CIL of log items but does not
switch out the commit record iclog, while the async CIL push executes in
the workqueue context so the drain is async, but it does switch out the
commit record iclog before it completes. IOW, the async CIL push is
basically a "more async" async log force.

I can see the need for the behavior of the async CIL push here, but that
leaves a mess of interfaces and behavior matrix. Is there any reason we
couldn't just make async log forces unconditionally behave equivalent to
the async CIL push as defined by this patch? There's only a handful of
existing users and I don't see any obvious reason why they might care
whether the underlying CIL push is synchronous or not...
