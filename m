Thanks Darrick.  sorry for the delay...

Darrick is absolutely correct.  But I would like to add that the user can check
the current file status (S_DAX flag) by using statx.  So while they don't have
control they can at least see what is happening.

This was the compromise we had to make considering the complexities of changing
a file on the fly.

This was discussed at length on the mailing list:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200422212102.3757660-5-ira.weiny@intel.com/

Also, we do try our best to evict the inode as soon as possible 'automatically'

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200409124127.GB18171@lst.de/

But there is just no guarantee that someone out there (a backup utility for
example) is not using the inode.  So the user just can't control this
absolutely.
