Ok, will do.

DOH!  I forgot about that.

Yep, that's correct.  I'll change the code to one folio, one bio.

<nod> I'll set iosize to 1MB by default and userspace can decrease it if
it so desires.

Also it occurs to me that max_hw_sectors_kb seems to be 128K for all of
my consumer nvme devices, and the fancy Intel ones too.  Funny that the
sata ssds set it to 4MB, but I guess capping at 128k is one way to
reduce the command latency...?  (Or the kernel's broken?  I can't figure
out how to get mpsmin with nvme-cli...)

Will do.  Only using the folio once per bio will make the control loop
easier to understand too.
