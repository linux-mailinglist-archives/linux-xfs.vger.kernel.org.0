Have you ever successfully restored a directory from a multi-file
backup?

Note that restore errors are often caused by something going wrong
during the dump and it not being noticed until restore is run and
the error found. And at that point, there's nothing that can be done
to "fix" the dump image so it can be restored.

What was the xfs_dump commands that created these dump files?

Did you take the dumps from a frozen filesystem or a read-only
snapshot of the filesystem, or just take it straight from a running
system?

What happens if you try to restore one dump at a time? i.e. is the
problem in the level 0 dump, or in one of the incrementals that are
based on the level 0 dump?

IIUC, this means an ancestor directory in the path doesn't exist in
the inventory and so the path for restore cannot be resolved
correctly.  Hence the inode gets placed in the orphanage under the
path name that is stored with the inode.

I /think/ this error implies that the backups (dumps) were taken from
an active filesystem. i.e between the time the dump was started
and when the inventory was finally updated, the directory structure
had changed and so the dump is internally inconsistent. Hence some of
the files that were recorded in the dump image were removed before
the inventory was updated, hence there's no directories present in
the inventory that reference those files and so they get salvaged
into the orphanage for admin cleanup.

It would be interesting to know what part of the above path is
actually missing from the dump inventory, because that might help
explain what went/is going wrong...

Cheers,

Dave.
