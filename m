Yes, it would ideally wait, or at least trigger on the last one. I'll
see if I can improve that. For any of my testing, the amount of
triggered short reads is minimal. For the verify case that we just ran,
we're talking 8-12 ios out of 820 thousand, or 0.001% of them. So
nothing that makes a performance difference in practical terms, though
it would be nice to not hand back short reads if we can avoid it. Not
for performance reasons, but for usage reasons.
