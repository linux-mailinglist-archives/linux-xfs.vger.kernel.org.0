First of all, i want to say that i think this is not a hardware issue, 
the hard drive sounds fine and it didn't show any signs of slowness, 
it's also not very old, got it the 10th of January.

The entire disk is behind luks encryption:
```
#lsblk
sdc         8:32   0   3.6T  0 disk
└─storage 254:1    0   3.6T  0 crypt
```

Recently i've been having some issues where the drive suddenly becomes 
unreadable (seems to be caused by kited) but all of the times it 
happened, using `xfs_repair` with the following syntax `sudo xfs_repair 
/dev/mapper/storage -v`; made the drive readable again, but this time i 
didn't have this luck, and the drive was unable to be repaired, leading 
to this error at the end:

```
Phase 6 - check inode connectivity...
         - resetting contents of realtime bitmap and summary inodes
         - traversing filesystem ...
         - agno = 0
bad hash table for directory inode 128 (no data entry): rebuilding

Invalid inode number 0x0
Metadata corruption detected at 0x56135ef283e8, inode 0x84 data fork

fatal error -- couldn't map inode 132, err = 117
```

I ran `xfs_db` to see what was happening on that inode:
`sudo xfs_db -x -c 'blockget inode 132' /dev/mapper/storage > xfs_db.log`
and this are the outputs:

- stderr:

- stdout:
It's a 14GB file, i will not send it.

Help trying to recover the data (move it to another drive) would be great.
ideally i would fix the error, and i would move the data to another 
drive, shrink the partition, make a new partition with EXT4 instead of 
XFS, and move the data to the new partition, shrink, expand, and keep 
doing that until everything is moved to EXT4 or some other file system, 
or XFS again without whole drive encryption; i think this issues are 
occurring because using luks on XFS is not a common thing, so it's 
probably untested and unstable.

I have found a possible solution for this problem in this mailing list.
The solution looks to be to clear the corrupted inode (132)
but i'm unable to find a way to do this while the drive is unmounted. Is 
this possible? if so, how?

https://forums.unraid.net/topic/66749-xfs-file-system-corruption-safest-way-to-fix/

I have also found this post on the unraid forums about the same error, 
(where i also found this email address), and the solution was the use a 
way older version of xfs_repair, but sadly that solution didn't work 
(probably because it's way too old?); Can you also confirm that the 
issue is fixed on xfs_repair xfs_repair version 5.8.0?
