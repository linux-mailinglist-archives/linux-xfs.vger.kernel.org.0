I *think* it's fine - we just need to push the AIL once the l_last_sync_lsn
has been updated. The items going into the AIL from this commit
will be at the head, anyway, so it won't make any difference to
pushing the items at tail of the AIL. What matters is the push
threshold is no longer truncated down by the l_last_sync_lsn....

Really, though, I just did this quick change because I didn't want
to have to do a major rework of this code without first knowing
whether it fixed the problem. This whole iclog completion function
needs cleaning up....

That will only trigger if we move something from the tail of the log
during insertion. There is no guarantee that will happen from this
iclog completion - there may be no relogging at all, so no wakeup
from the AIL insert process....

Right, the first patch addresses the hang where a tail update occurs
after this iclog hits the disk and inserts everything into the AIL.
This patch addresses the variant (that is much harder to hit) where
no tail updates occur after this iclog hits the disk and completes.

Both are necessary, AFAICT.

Cheers,

Dave.
