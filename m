Yes, I know about this. I haven't done anything about it yet because
I haven't decided yet whether it should stay or be removed. Getting
the test and the code it tests working has been my focus so far.

I have a wrapper script that sets the knob for the entire of the
fstests run (i.e. so all attr and recovery tests exercise the LARP
functionality) and so I'm not sure that this test should twiddle the
knob at all. i.e. right now it would be more useful to me for the
test to check if the knob is not set to just _not_run the test,
rather than turn it on and off and all that...

Indeed, we probably shouldn't be forcing everyone to test a brand
new experimental feature that might be unstable and cause the test
run to halt prematurely (e.g. because it crashes).

sysfs knobs get reset by reboots to load a new kernel, so the impact
is identical - I have to reset the knob every time I load a new test
kernel, just like you have to reset it every time you load a new
module.

Yup, there are a bunch of tests that I never run because:

- scsi_debug requires modular kernel
- I always build with fatal XFS ASSERTs, so the tests that want
  non-fatal asserts don't run
- xfs/43[4-6] require a modular kernel
- xfs/490 requires CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG be turned off (I *never* do
  that)
- I generally don't have source code on my test machines, so
  api-violations.sh won't run (xfs/437)

And there's probably a few more in that list as well.

IMO, any test that depends on a specific debug config or test
environment setup that aren't (or can't be) consistently used by the
entire developer base should be discouraged precisely because it
means different developers end up with different code coverage and
might miss problems they really should know about.

Doesn't running fstests with KASAN enabled find those slab leaks?

I don't want it turned on unconditionally - I have to test both the
existing code path and the new LARP code path, so I'm constantly
toggling the value between test runs.
