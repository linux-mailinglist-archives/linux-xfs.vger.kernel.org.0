The dabtree allows duplicate hashes for a given name, yes.  It doesn't
allow for duplicate names, though.

(Also note that small xattr structures skip the dabtree and hashing.)

Theoretically, yes, the parent pointer code could walk all the xattrs
that have the same attr name looking for the one with matching value.
But keep in mind that there could be min(2^32, 2^(8+76)) potential
matches.

The other difficulty is that the xattr lookup and removal code don't
have a means to return the dastate to callers or for callers to provide
a dastate to go back into the xattr code.  You'd need that to identify
the specific parent pointer xattr you want to operate on.

Yep.  Hash functions are definitely finger-crossing headhurting.
