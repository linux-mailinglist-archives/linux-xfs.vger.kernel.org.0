I sympathize. There was at least a week in there that I spent pretty
much on nothing but review. :/

I agree that we can and do accept code as such in certain cases, but not
always or by default. Usually, only when it makes sense due to
complexity, cross subsystem issues, etc. If the situation is the
submitter has sent a large patch series at a point where it's already so
unwieldy to change because of non-upstream reasons that some restricted
form of review is required, then I think that's a bit unfair to the
upstream community.

Using the whole block reclaim/retry loop thing as an example (just
because it was the most recent example of this kind of thing causing you
grief), perhaps those foundational changes should have been sent to the
list earlier before they became "too unwieldy to change?" I think it's
perfectly reasonable to send lightly tested or compile tested only
patches for initial thoughts, factoring feedback, etc., particularly if
a change proposes to add retry loops to various transaction allocation
callers. That's a fairly significant change in some core areas.

ISTM that on one hand review is fairly open ended and it's not really up
to the submitter to declare the scope of reviewer feedback (the
submitter is then certainly free to change certain things or not, but
the goal should be to cooperate toward some common ground). OTOH I
suppose the open development model allows for a community to determine a
standard for if/how they prefer to review patches.

That said, I personally don't like the "accept ugly code now, fix it
later over time" model by default because for one, I think it leads to a
lower quality mainline. I also think there's an implied assumption in
there that a reviewer wants to review endless series of cleanup patches
after providing such feedback on early versions of functionality. I know
if I take the time to review a 30+ patch series and had some
non-negligible amount of aesthetic feedback, I'm not really looking to
review another 20+ patches some time later just to clean up a mess that
the first series might have (unnecessarily) created, particularly when
the feedback has already been provided and so iterative review is more
time efficient (I find review much more time consuming than
development).

I dunno. That's just my .02 I guess. I do agree with Dave's previous
statements that not everything has to be 100% mutually agreeable. I
generally try to accommodate that by incorporating suggestions into my
own patches that I might not necessarily agree with, but don't feel
strongly enough about, to save time and keep things moving. Conversely
on the review side, I generally try to defer to other reviewers to see
whether my particular position might be in the majority or minority, and
go with that (That doesn't always mean I'm going to put reviewed-by tags
on patches I really don't like. In some cases, I think reviewing for
function/bugs and not nacking a patch is a form of compromise. ;).

I don't distrust that any XFS developers would make promised fixes as
such. I don't really see that as a problem at all. I think the whole
subsystem rework thing is pretty much a distraction from the original
feedback. E.g., I think your wrapper idea (explored in my previous
reply) is yet another reasonable solution that doesn't involve or
require any sort of broader rework.
