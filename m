Do I understand the current code (__bio_try_merge_page() ->
page_is_mergeable()) correctly in that we're checking for physical page
contiguity and not necessarily requiring a new bio_vec per physical
page?

With regard to Dave's earlier point around seeing excessively sized bio
chains.. If I set up a large memory box with high dirty mem ratios and
do contiguous buffered overwrites over a 32GB range followed by fsync, I
can see upwards of 1GB per bio and thus chains on the order of 32+ bios
for the entire write. If I play games with how the buffered overwrite is
submitted (i.e., in reverse) however, then I can occasionally reproduce
a ~32GB chain of ~32k bios, which I think is what leads to problems in
I/O completion on some systems. Granted, I don't reproduce soft lockup
issues on my system with that behavior, so perhaps there's more to that
particular issue.

Regardless, it seems reasonable to me to at least have a conservative
limit on the length of an ioend bio chain. Would anybody object to
iomap_ioend growing a chain counter and perhaps forcing into a new ioend
if we chain something like more than 1k bios at once?
