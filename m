With difficulty.

Exercising all the weird corner cases is really hard because the
combinatory explosion that occurs when you have 20 control
parameters, up to 5 different failure fallback strategies,
behavioural variations with delayed allocation, ENOSPC and AGFL
refilling accounting variations, etc, means it's basically
impossible to enumerate and iterate the behaviour space fully.
And then we have filesystem geometry and application concurrency
to consider, too.

All of the behaviours up to this point in time are best effort - we
don't guarantee allocation policy is followed when there is not
enough free space to execute the preferred policy - we slowly fall
back to mechanisms that are further from the policy but more likely
to succeed. i.e. as we approach ENOSPC, the allocation policies get
"looser" - they are less restrictive and more variable and don't
give as good results as when there is plenty of free space for the
allocation policy to make good decisions from.

As such, I only check that macro-level behaviour when there is lots
of free space is largely correct. e.g. by doing something like
copying a kernel tree onto a new filesystem, then checking inode
locality follows directories, block locality follows inodes, large
files are stripe aligned, extent size hint based inodes appear to
have the correct extent sizes, etc.

I then rely on the ENOSPC tests in fstests to find regressions that
might occur when the filesystem is stressed with little free space
available. These are a whole lot better than they used to be; root
cause analysis of ENOSPC corner case bugs has consumed months of my
working life over the past 20 years....

That's because it's largely impossible to write a test that is
deterministic and works on all possible test configurations. Even
changing the size of the filesystem even slightly can result in
vastly different but still 100% correct allocation
behaviour....

I don't see any value in that because it's not actually a "fatal"
issue. See above about trading off policy strictness for allocation
success.

Again, this force alignment stuff is a fundamental change in this
behaviour - it wants "hard failure" rather than "trade off" and so
there isn't a general case for asserting that allocation must be
mod/prod aligned. Extent size hints are a -hint-, not a requirement,
and I don't want random assert failures in test systems because
debug kernels start treating hints as "must not fail" requirements.

Good, that's how it should work. :) 

I'll update the patchset I have with these fixes.
