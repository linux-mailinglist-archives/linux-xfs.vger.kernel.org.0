It will delay it until the inode has been reclaimed, in which case
reallocating it will result in a new struct xfs_inode being
allocated from slab, and we're all good. Any lookup that finds the
old inode will see either I_WILL_FREE, I_FREEING, I_CLEAR,
XFS_NEED_INACTIVE, XFS_IRECLAIM or ip->i_ino == 0 depending on what
point the lookup occurs. Hence the lookup will be unable to take a
new reference to the unlinked inode, and the lookup retry should
then get the newly allocated xfs_inode once it has been inserted
into the radix tree...

IOWs, it gets rid of recycling altogether, and that's how we avoid
the RCU grace period issues with recycled inodes.

To find out if we can do something fast and effective (and without
hacks that might bite us unexepectedly) with RCU grace periods that
is less intrusive than changing inode life cycles. If it turns out
that we can change the inode life cycle faster than we can come up
with a RCU grace period based solution, then we should just go with
inode life cycle changes and forget about the interim RCU grace
period detection changes...

It seems to me that the RCU detection code is also a ways out,
so I'm trying to keep our options open and not have us duplicate
work unnecessarily.

*nod*

The signs are pointing somewhat that way, but I'm still finding
the occasional unexpected gotcha in the code that I have to work
around. I think I've got them all, but until I've got it working it
pays to keep our options open....

Cheers,

Dave.
