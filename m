So this patch is relying on something else hanging before we get to
xfs_wait_buftarg and hence "we don't have to handle that here".

Please document that assumption along with the ASSERT, because if we
change AIL behaviour to prevent retry-forever hangs with freeze
and/or remount-ro we're going to hit this assert...

Cheers,

Dave.
