Oh, I misunderstood what you were asking.  I don't think we want to
implement that.

e.g. If it's a pre-allocated image file or block device on
sparse-capable storage being mkfs'd, then the user really doesn't
want it punched out, do they?

And it's for the journal: any ENOSPC error from the block device in
the journal is immediately fatal to the filesystem. Hence I think
we should not punch out the journal blocks that already are allocated
in the storage.

And, really, the space may have already been punched out via
attempting to trim the device (i.e. "-K" mkfs option wasn't set), in
which case punching here is redundant.

Also, libxfs_device_zero() is called by xfs_repair: do we want
xfs_repair to be punching out blocks for the realtime bitmap and
summary storage? I don't think we want that to happen, either.

Fast zeroing, yes. Punching out allocated storage, no.

That might be going a bit far. fallocate() in most cases is not
critical to the correct functioning of the production tools, so if
it's not present it shouldn't break anything.

Who builds their distro binaries on a userspace that doesn't contain
the headers and libaries the distro is going to ship with?

That's the whole point of "build-root" infrastructure, right? i.e.
build against what you are going to ship, not what is installed on
the build machine....

There's more than one linux "platform" we have to support, and this
abstraction makes it easy to include new functionality in a clean
and autoconf detection friendly way... :)
