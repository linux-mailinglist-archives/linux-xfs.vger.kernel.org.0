Yes.. that was it, thanks. So IIRC from that, we basically already have
plans to introduce a mechanism to manage this sort of scenario where a
newer kernel can incorporate log format changes and help ensure that an
older kernel won't fumble over log recovery without having to create a
hard backwards incompatibility. Of course there are still cases where
that might be a hurdle (i.e. upgrade failure -> rollback and recovery
scenarios across an fs feature upgrade boundary), but that should be
rare and I don't think the scheme needs to be perfect. There's also the
caveat that a format change associated with a particular isolated
operation is less pervasive (more transient) than something like "start
record ordering," which might be something that effectively has to be
enabled whenever the log is dirty, but otherwise ISTM that the existence
of this mechanism should at least facilitate consideration of a recovery
side fix as a valid option. Hm?
