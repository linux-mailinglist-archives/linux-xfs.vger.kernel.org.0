Ok, I see it.  Yes I think so, I will see if I can take it out

As I recall, I had initially not removed this roll in v5, and I had an 
extra XFS_DAS_RM_INVALIDATE state to roll the transaction here.  And 
then I think we reasoned that because invalidating blocks didnt have in 
core changes, we could just remove it, thus getting rid of the extra 
state.  Later I split it out into this separate patch along with a few 
other transaction rolls that we identified as not being necessary.

I'm not sure that was the argument at the time, but I think it makes 
sense. :-)  Will split off into separate patch.

Thanks for the reviews!
