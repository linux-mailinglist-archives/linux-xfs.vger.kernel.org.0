As I mentioned, the IO path can be more complex than you think.

The real case I hit is that the process A is waiting for inode unpin on 
XFS A which is a loop device backed mount.

And the backing file is from a different (X)FS B mount. So the IO is 
going through loop device, (direct) writes to (X)FS B.

The (direct) writes to (X)FS B do memory allocations and then memory 
direct reclaims...
