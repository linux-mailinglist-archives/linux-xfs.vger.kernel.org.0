Agreed.  For simple things like crc32 I would very much rather we stuff
them in a per-group btree because we only have to store the crc once in
the filesystem and now it protects all owners of that block.  In theory
the double-crc scheme would work fine for untorn data block writes, I
think.

I only see a reason for per-file hash structures in the dabtree if the
hashes themselves have some sort of per-file configuration (like
distributor-signed merkle trees or whatever).  I asked Eric Biggers if
he had any plans for mutable fsverity files and he said no.
