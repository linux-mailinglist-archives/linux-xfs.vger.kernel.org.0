Feel free to explain any of the above..? Where do you currently assign
sb->s_fs_info, for example?

I see. This is probably something that should be noted in the commit
log (that the ordering changes from before such that we need to allocate
mp a bit earlier). This is reasonable because even though the current
code allocs mp in the fill_super callback, we parse arguments
immediately after the mp allocation and don't otherwise rely on the sb
in that code.

If I follow correctly, it sounds like perhaps we need to separate the
management of sb->s_fs_info from the "ownership" of mp. For example,
allocate mp, assign fc->s_fs_info and free via xfs_fc_free() as you do
now. In the xfs_fill_super() callback, pull mp from fc->s_fs_info and
assign it to sb->s_fs_info. If we fail at this point, reset
sb->s_fs_info to NULL and let the fc infrastructure deal with freeing mp
in its own callback.

What I'm not clear on is whether something like xfs_fs_put_super()
should still free mp as well. Once the filesystem successfully mounts,
are we still going to see an xfs_fc_free() callback, or is this all just
transient mount path stuff? If the former, perhaps put_super() should
also not free mp and just reset its own ->s_fs_info reference. If the
latter, then I guess we just need to understand at what point during a
successful mount responsibility to free transfers from one place to the
other. Thoughts?
