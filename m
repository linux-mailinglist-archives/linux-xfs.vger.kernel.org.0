One thing missing from this patch -- if the test formatted the scratch
device with non-default geometry, the backup superblocks from that
filesystem will not be erased.  Going back to my example from the email
thread, if the scratch disk has:

  SB0 [16M zeroes] SB1 [16M zeroes] <4 more AGs> <zeroes from 100M to 1G> \
      SB'1 [1G space] SB'2 [1G space] SB'3 [1G space]

Where SB[0-5] are the ones written by xfs/030 and SB'[1-3] were written
by a previous test that did the default scratch device mkfs, then this
patch will wipe out SB'[1-3] and SB0:

  000 [16M zeroes] SB1 [16M zeroes] <4 more AGs> <zeroes from 100M to 1G> \
      0000 [1G space] 0000 [1G space] 0000 [1G space]

But that still leaves SB[1-5] which xfs_repair could stumble over later.
For example, if the next test to be run formats a filesystem with 24MB
AGs (instead of 16) and zaps the superblock, then repair will eventually
try a linear scan looking for superblocks and find the ones from the
16MB filesystem first.

There isn't a sequence of tests that do this, but so long as we're
fixing this we might as well zap as much as we can.  So I propose adding
to try_wipe_scratch_xfs() the following:

	dbsize=
	_scratch_xfs_db -c 'sb 0' -c 'p blocksize agblocks agcount' 2>&1 | \
		sed -e 's/ = /=/g' -e 's/blocksize/dbsize/g' \
		    -e 's/agblocks/agsize/g' > $tmp.mkfs
	. $tmp.mkfs

and then repeat the for loop.  If there isn't a filesystem then
$tmp.mkfs will be an empty file and the loop won't run.

We probably ought to delegate all wiping to try_wipe_scratch_xfs, i.e.:

	test -b $dev || continue
	case "$FSTYP" in
	"xfs")
		_try_wipe_scratch_xfs
		;;
	*)
		$WIPEFS_PROG -a $dev
		;;
	esac

and add the WIPEFS_PROG call to _try_wipe_scratch_xfs.

Add code as discussed above.
