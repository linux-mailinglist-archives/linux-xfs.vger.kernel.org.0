But isn't that just another variation of the initial conditions
(minlen/maxlen) not being set up correctly for alignment when the AG
is empty?

i.e. Take the above condition and change it like this:

 	/*
 	 * Adjust for alignment
 	 */
-	if (blen > args.alignment && blen <= args.maxlen)
+	if (blen > args.alignment && blen <= args.maxlen + args.alignment)
 		args.minlen = blen - args.alignment;
 	args.minalignslop = 0;

and now we cover all the cases when blen covers an aligned maxlen
allocation...

Cheers,

Dave.
