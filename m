This confuses me a bit.  Let me try to see if I understood it correctly:

 - currently xfs_scrub is called on the mount point, where the
   mount-point is the first non-optional argument

With this patch there is a new environment variable that tells it what
mount point to use, and only uses the one passed as the argument for
reporting messages.

If I understand this correctly I find the decision odd.  I can see
why you want to separate the two.  But I'd still expect the mount point
to operate on to be passed as the argument, with an override for the
reported messages.  And I'd expect the override passed as a normal
command line option and not an environment variable.
