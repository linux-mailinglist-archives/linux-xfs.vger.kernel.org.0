Hence the suggestion to refactor it..

xfs_bmap_add_attrfork() already asserts that the attr fork is
nonexistent at the very top of the function, for one. The 25-30 lines of
that function that we need can be trivially lifted out into a new helper
that can equally as trivially accommodate the size == 0 case and skip
all those shortform calculations.

I'm not arguing that the attr fork needs to be set up in a particular
way on initial creation. I'm arguing that we don't need yet a third
unique code path to set/initialize a default/empty attr fork. We can
slowly normalize them all to the _reset() technique you're effectively
reimplementing here if that works well enough and is preferred...

I'm not sure what's so odd or controversial about refactoring and
reusing an existing operational (i.e. add fork) function to facilitate
review and future maintenance of that particular operation being
performed from new and various contexts. And speaking in generalities
like this just obfuscates and overcomplicates the argument. Let's be
clear, we're literally arguing over a delta that would look something
like this:

xfs_bmap_set_attrforkoff()
{
...
+		if (size)
-               ip->i_d.di_forkoff = xfs_attr_shortform_bytesfit(ip, size);
+			ip->i_d.di_forkoff = xfs_attr_shortform_bytesfit(ip, size);
                if (!ip->i_d.di_forkoff)
                        ip->i_d.di_forkoff = xfs_default_attroffset(ip) >> 3;
		...
}

Given all of that, I'm not convinced this is nearly the problem you seem
to insinuate, yet I also don't think I'll convince you otherwise so it's
probably not worth continuing to debate. You have my feedback, I'll let
others determine how this patch comes together from here...
