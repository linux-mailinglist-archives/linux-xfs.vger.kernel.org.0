Not that I know of. I would probably rewrite the above comment as:

/*
 * Checking XFS_IS_*QUOTA_ON() while inside an active quota modifying
 * transaction context guarantees quota will be not be switched until after the
 * entire rolling transaction chain is completed.
 */

To clarify the situation. Having the inode locked will now only
guarantee that the dquot will not go away while the inode is locked,
it doesn't guarantee that quota will not switch off any more.

Yes, I think you are right - the ACTIVE flag could probably away as
it doesn't really play a part in the quota-off dance anymore. We'd
still need the IS_QUOTA_ON() checks, but they'd look at ACCT|ENFD
instead...

Cheers,

Dave.
