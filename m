I don't use that - I prefer to work from commits than mange patches
directly. What I do take the list of commits that it creates, then
run 'guilt import-commit <id range>' to pull the commits made from
the patches into a guilt maintained patch series in the git
repository. That generally requires checking that all the commits
that were pulled in were the ones that were wanted, but then I can
manage the branch as a "patch series in git commits" as needed.
That's far easier than managing patches by hand to build a series to
apply to the git tree....

Cheers,

Dave.
