I don't think a randomly triggered abort is better than a targeted trip
point.  However...

...since we know that a given xfs_repair run will trigger a bunch of
disk writes between phase 2 and phase 6, I think I could build a
trigger that would abort() after N writes to a device.  From there it
wouldn't be hard to add a test that does (more or less):

for i in {0..1000..10}; do
	xfs_mdrestore <dumpfile> /dev/sda
	XFS_REPAIR_DEBUG_FAIL_WRITE=$i xfs_repair /dev/sda
	xfs_db -c version /dev/sda | grep NEEDSREPAIR || _fail
	xfs_repair /dev/sda
	xfs_db -c version /dev/sda | grep NEEDSREPAIR && _fail
done

This sounds like a reasonable second trip point for the directory repair
checker, since we know that the sketchy directory repair bits happen in
phase 3 and/or phase 6:

<fuzz dirent>
XFS_REPAIR_DEBUG_FAIL_PHASE=6 xfs_repair /dev/sda
xfs_db -c version /dev/sda | grep NEEDSREPAIR || _fail
xfs_repair /dev/sda
xfs_db -c version /dev/sda | grep NEEDSREPAIR && _fail

This is a good starting point, thanks. :)

In the meantime I guess Eric can take the other 2 fully reviewed series
as well as patches 1-7 and 10 from this series since (AFAICT) those
pieces are fully reviewed.
