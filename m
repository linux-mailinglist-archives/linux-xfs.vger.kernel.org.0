Currently, the tests are being run 10x per config without the patches.
If a failure is seen with the patches, the tests are rerun on the
baseline several hundred times to see if the failure was a regression or
to determine the baseline failure rate.

Could you elaborate on this a bit? Are you hoping to gain insight from
comparing 5.10.y baseline with 5.15.y baseline or are you hoping to
allow people working on the same stable branch to have a joint record of
test run output?

I can go ahead and bump up the amount of test runs. It would be nice to
agree on the number of test runs and the specific configs to test. For a
fixed amount of resources there is a tradeoff between broader coverage
through more configs vs more solid results with fewer configs. I am not
sure where everyone's priorities lie.

After the new runs, I'll go ahead and post the baseline and send out a
link so we can compare.

I am planning on batching into smaller groups, 10 at a time works for
me.

Best,
Leah
