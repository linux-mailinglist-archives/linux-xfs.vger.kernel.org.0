While testing xfs/233 and xfs/127 with LARP mode enabled, I noticed
errors such as the following:

<snip>

0x1 corresponds to XFS_SB_FEAT_INCOMPAT_LOG_XATTRS, which is the feature
bit used to indicate that the log contains extended attribute log intent
items.  This is a mechanism to prevent older kernels from trying to
recover log items that they won't know how to recover.

I thought about this a little bit more, and realized that log_incompat
features bits are set on the primary sb prior to writing certain types
of log records, and cleared once the log has written the committed
changes back to the filesystem.  If the secondary superblocks are
updated at any point during that interval (due to things like growfs or
setting labels), the log_incompat field will now be set on the secondary
supers.

Due to the ephemeral nature of the current log_incompat feature bits,
a discrepancy between the primary and secondary supers is not a
corruption.  If we're in dry run mode, we should log the discrepancy,
but that's not a reason to end with EXIT_FAILURE.
