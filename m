I'm still not sold at all on this series.  It adds a lot of code and
makes it much harder to understand.  So I'd much rather go back and
figuring out how we can do delayed attrs in a more streamlined way.
The has_attr and co changes are some of exactly that kind of logic
that is just making things worse in the standalone patch set, so even
if we must end up with it they absolutely belong into a series actually
adding functionality, as they have no use on their own.

Independent of that we'll need to clean up the flags mess, so I'd rather
just go ahead with that for now.
