We are not stuck at all.
It is very simple to fix.
As you can see from the strace above and from Dave explanation,
The test as I posted in v1 already does the right thing, because
it does fsync the original file.
Which explains why the test I posted DOES work as expected on
both xfs and overlayfs and DOES reproduce the bug.

However, if we want to write the test in a way that does NOT assume
that xfs_io -c fsync operates on all the open files, I need to add some
more commands:

$XFS_IO_PROG -x -c "mmap 0 4k" -c "mwrite 0 4k" \
        -c "open $(_scratch_shutdown_handle)" -c shutdown \
        -c "file 0" -c fsync \
        -c "mwrite 0 4k" $file | _filter_scratch | _filter_xfs_io

The only problem is this complicates the golden output
which does not produce the same output for overlayfs and xfs
open files, so I need to write another filter for that.

The question is, is it worth it?

Are we ever going to change xfs_io -c fsync to behave
differently and fsync only the current file?

If not, that I can just change the comment and keep the command
and golden output:

 # path. This produced an iomap warning because writeback failure
clears Uptodate
 # status on the page.
 # For this test to run on overlayfs we open a different file to perform
-# shutdown+fsync while keeping the writeback target file open.
+# shutdown while keeping the writeback target file open.
+# xfs_io -c fsync post-shutdown performs fsync also on the writeback
target file,
+# which is critical for triggering the writeback failure.
 file=$SCRATCH_MNT/file
 $XFS_IO_PROG -fc "pwrite 0 4k" -c fsync $file | _filter_xfs_io
 $XFS_IO_PROG -x -c "mmap 0 4k" -c "mwrite 0 4k" \
        -c "open $(_scratch_shutdown_handle)" -c shutdown -c fsync \
        -c "mwrite 0 4k" $file | _filter_xfs_io

All of the above are overkills.
The test fix already works.

Thanks,
