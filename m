FWIW, we try to avoid "__" prefixes when factoring code out. The new
function should be obvious in it's function to have a proper name.

In this case, we are going to try to allocate an inode in the
provided AG. So xfs_dialloc_try_ag() would seem appropriate.

Also, in that case, an -EAGAIN or -EBUSY error might be more
appropriate for a "cannot allocate in this AG" soft failure rather
than having a tri-state return value. We should not get either of
those errors from inode allocation, so such an error would indicate
to the caller that is should just try the next AG...

However, I think there's a higher layer cleanup than needs to be
done here first....

This whole "ialloc_context/IO_agbp" thing has always been a nasty
wart in this code. I think getting rid that wart then makes this
change a lot cleaner and more obvious.

Completely untested patch below for you to start from...

Cheers,

xfs: rework inode allocation interface

From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

Get rid of the nasty, confusing ialloc_context and messy ENOSPC and
failure handling around xfs_ialloc() and xfs_dialloc() by separating
free inode chunk allocation and inode allocation into two individual
high level operations.
