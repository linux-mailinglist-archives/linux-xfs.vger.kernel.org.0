No. We do not hold the i_rwsem across async DIO read or write, so
we can have DIO in flight whilst a buffered write grabs and holds
the i_rwsem exclusive. This is the problem that i_dio_count solves
for truncate, etc. i.e. the only way to actually ensure there is no
DIO in flight is to grab the i_rwsem exclusive and then call
inode_dio_wait() to ensure all async DIO in flight completes before
continuing.

It does not. If the lock is held for read and there is a pending
write, new readers are queued behind the pending write waiters
(see rwsem_down_read_slowpath(), which is triggered if there are
pending waiters on an attempt to read lock).

Say what? The dio/buffered exclusion change provides a different
data coherency and correctness model that is required to then
optimising the workload you care about - mixed buffered read/write.

This change doesn't optimise either DIO or buffered IO, nor is a
shared-exclusive BIO/DIO lock isn't going to improve performance of
such mixed IO workloads in any way.  IOWs, it's pretty hard to call
a locking model change like this "optimisation", let alone call it
"premature".

Yes and no. mixed buffered/direct IO worklaods are more common than
you think. e.g. many backup programs use direct IO and so inherently
mix DIO with buffered IO for the majority of files the backup
program touches. However, all we care about in this case is data
coherency, not performance, and this change should improve data
coherency between DIO and buffered IO...

I don't see how this can be made to work w.r.t. sane data coherency
behaviour. e.g. how does this model serialise a new DIO write that
is submitted after a share-locked buffered write has just started
and passed all the "i_dio_count == 0" checks that enable it to use
shared locking? i.e. we now have potentially overlapping buffered
writes and DIO writes being done concurrently because the buffered
write may not have instantiated folios in the page cache yet....

Have you looked at how simple the bcachefs buffered/dio exclusion
implementation is? The lock mechanism itself is about 50 lines of
code, and there are only 4 or 5 places where the lock is actually
needed. It doesn't get much simpler than that.

And, quite frankly, the fact the bcachefs solution also covers AIO
DIO in flight (which i_rwsem based locking does not!) means it is a
more robust solution than trying to rely on racy i_dio_count hacks
and folio residency in the page cache...
