I thought it might have been to facilitate ioend completion in interrupt
(i.e. bio completion) context, but I'm really not sure. That's why I'm
asking. :) I'm hoping Christoph can provide some context since it
appears to be his original implementation.

That's pretty much what I'm referring to in step 2 above. I was just
thinking it might make sense to implement some sort of batching model
first to avoid scenarios where we have a bunch of discontiguous append
ioends in the completion list and really only need to update the file
size at the end. (Hence a flag or whatever to indicate the last ioend
must call xfs_setfilesize()).

That said, we do still have contiguous ioend merging happening already.
We could certainly just rely on that, update di_size as we process each
append ioend and worry about further optimization later. That might be
more simple and less code (and a safer first step)..
