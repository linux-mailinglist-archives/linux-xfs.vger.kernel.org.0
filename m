Yeah, I'm.. not sure where the idea of mixing them comes from.

To try and clarify, I was just prioritizing reducing confusion of the
set aside bits over whether they happen to be reported as available
space or not. I.e., if we wanted to consolidate to a single helper and
use that everywhere with the side effect that set aside blocks are not
shown as free, then that sounds reasonable to me (re: to Dave's follow
up point as well). OTOH, if you had some reason to not do the latter,
then we should at least try to eliminate the need to duplicate the set
aside naming/calculation where it does happen to be used, because either
way the current code is sort of written to nearly ensure it won't be
used correctly.
