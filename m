Pretty much. ;) I think it's reasonable in theory to say something like
"pick one or the other for older fs," but then we have to get into
issues like being subtly affected by code changes that might reorder
mount options without any notion of that affecting behavior (i.e. very
brittle) and/or choosing one option of the other based on the current
status of the [pg]quota inode, which is more implementation and doesn't
rule out having to fail the mount in all cases anyways. Suffice it to
say I don't think it's worth going further down that path simply to
support passing a combination of mount options that has no runtime
effect and was never a supported combination for the associated version
of the fs in the first place.
