Hmm, so I guess what you're saying is that if the memory buffer
allocation in ->get_link is slow enough, some other thread can free the
inode, drop it, reallocate it, and reinstantiate it (not as a symlink
this time) all before ->get_link's memory allocation call returns, after
which Bad Things Happen(tm)?

Can the lookup thread end up with the wrong inode->i_ops too?

Any inode can become a recycle candidate (i.e. RECLAIMABLE but otherwise
idle) but I think your point here is that unlinked inodes that become
recycling candidates can cause lookup threads to trip over symlinks, and
that's why we need to assign RCU state and poll on it, right?

(That wasn't a challenge, I'm just making sure I understand this
correctly.)

If you rm -rf $path, do each of the inodes get a separate rcu state, or
do they share?

Hmm.  The description says that we only need the rcu synchronization
when we're freeing an inode after its link count drops to zero, because
that's the vector for (say) the VFS inode ops actually changing due to
free/inactivate/reallocate/recycle while someone else is doing a lookup.

I'm a bit puzzled why this unconditionally starts an rcu grace period,
instead of done only if i_nlink==0; and why we call cond_synchronize_rcu
above unconditionally instead of checking for i_mode==0 (or whatever
state the cached inode is left in after it's freed)?
