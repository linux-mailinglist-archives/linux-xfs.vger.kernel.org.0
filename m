Subject: [RFC PATCH] xfs: test DONTCACHE behavior with the inode cache
Message-ID: <20210825230703.GH12640@magnolia>

List-ID: <linux-xfs.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-xfs@vger.kernel.org

From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

Basic testing that DONTCACHE affects the XFS inode cache in the manner
that we expect.  The only way we can do that (for XFS, anyway) is to
play around with the BULKSTAT ioctl.

+# Functional testing for the I_DONTCACHE inode flag, as set by the BULKSTAT
+# ioctl.  This flag neuters the inode cache's tendency to try to hang on to
+# incore inodes for a while after the last program closes the file, which
+# is helpful for filesystem scanners to avoid trashing the inode cache.
+#
+# However, the inode cache doesn't always honor the DONTCACHE behavior -- the
+# only time it really applies is to cache misses from a bulkstat scan.  If
+# any other threads accessed the inode before or immediately after the scan,
+# the DONTCACHE flag is ignored.  This includes other scans.
+#
+# Regrettably, there is no way to poke /only/ XFS inode reclamation directly,
+# so we're stuck with setting xfssyncd_centisecs to a low value and watching
+# the slab counters.
