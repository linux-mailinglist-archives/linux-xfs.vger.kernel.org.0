Hi all,

Ok, so here we are yet again with "Let's deprecate xfs_check out of
fstests for $raisins!", and once again there's the question of what evil
things does repair miss that check didn't?

I hacked up the xfs_repair fuzz tests in fstests to see which ones would
produce cases where xfs_repair -n says the fs is fine but xfs_check
complains and returns nonzero, with the results recorded below.  I did a
little triage...

1. The uid/gid/projid fuzzers and the diskdq fuzzers all seem to fail on
account of the fact that repair does not actually check the quota
counters.

2. While the numrecs fuzz and the directory leaf failures actually spray
btree verifier errors, somehow those are not turned into exit(1).

3. Not sure what the blockcount ones are about, I think that might
simply be inadequate record checking on repair's part.

Those last two are /probably/ simple fixes to xfs_repair.

Not sure what to do about quota in repair -- we could build in the
ability to do quota counts since we scan the whole inode table and
directory tree anyway.  From there it's not so hard to rebuild the quota
inodes too.

Thoughts?
