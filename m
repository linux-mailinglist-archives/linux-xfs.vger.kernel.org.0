From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

Currently, we don't let an internal log consume every last block in an
AG.  According to the comment, we're doing this to avoid tripping AGF
verifiers if freeblks==0, but on a modern filesystem this isn't
sufficient to avoid problems.  First, the per-AG reservations for
reflink and rmap claim up to about 1.7% of each AG for btree expansion,
and secondly, we need to have enough space in the AG to allocate the
root inode chunk, if it should be the case that the log ends up in AG 0.
We don't care about nonredundant (i.e. agcount==1) filesystems, but it
can also happen if the user passes in -lagnum=0.

Change this constraint so that we can't leave less than 5% free space
after allocating the log.  This is perhaps a bit much, but as we're
about to disallow tiny filesystems anyway, it seems unlikely to cause
problems with scenarios that we care about.
