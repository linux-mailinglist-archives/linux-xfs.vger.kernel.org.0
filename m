phase 6 on large directories is cpu bound on duplicate name checking
due to the algorithm having effectively O(n^2) scalability. Hence
when the duplicate name hash table  size is far smaller than the
number of directory entries, we end up with long hash chains that
are searched linearly on every new entry that is found in the
directory to do duplicate detection.

The in-memory hash table size is limited to 64k entries. Hence when
we have millions of entries in a directory, duplicate entry lookups
on the hash table have substantial overhead. Scale this table out to
larger sizes so that we keep the chain lengths short and hence the
O(n^2) scalability impact is limited because N is always small.

For a 10M entry directoryi consuming 400MB of directory data, the
hash table now sizes at 6.4 million entries instead of ~64k - it is
~100x larger. While the hash table now consumes ~50MB of RAM, the
xfs_repair footprint barely changes at it's using already consuming
~9GB of RAM at this point in time. IOWs, the incremental memory
usage change is noise, but the directory checking time:

Unpatched:

  97.11%  xfs_repair          [.] dir_hash_add
   0.38%  xfs_repair          [.] longform_dir2_entry_check_data
   0.34%  libc-2.31.so        [.] __libc_calloc
   0.32%  xfs_repair          [.] avl_ino_start

Phase 6:        10/22 12:11:40  10/22 12:14:28  2 minutes, 48 seconds

Patched:

  46.74%  xfs_repair          [.] radix_tree_lookup
  32.13%  xfs_repair          [.] dir_hash_see_all
   7.70%  xfs_repair          [.] radix_tree_tag_get
   3.92%  xfs_repair          [.] dir_hash_add
   3.52%  xfs_repair          [.] radix_tree_tag_clear
   2.43%  xfs_repair          [.] crc32c_le

Phase 6:        10/22 13:11:01  10/22 13:11:18  17 seconds

has been reduced by an order of magnitude.
