Correct.

I think there would still be a race if we did that -- I don't see
anything in __fput that prohibits another thread from initiating a
freeze after the release process calls _can_free_eofblocks but before
the actual call to _free_eofblocks.

Hm.  How often would we have a readonly fd pointing to a file that has
posteof blocks?  I suppose this could happen if the system was extending
a file, crashed, and then someone remounted, opened a ro fd, and then
closed and froze the fs at the same time...?
