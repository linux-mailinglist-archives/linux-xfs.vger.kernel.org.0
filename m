From a quick glance, it looks like all the random things I had comments
about were fixed, so for patches 14, 20-23, 28, and 42:
Reviewed-by: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

I'm leaving off patch #7 until tomorrow so that I can think about it
with a non-tired brain.  I didn't see anything obviously wrong in the
diff itself -- but I still need to adjust my mental model per what Dave
said in his previously reply (active perag refs are for user-facing
online operations, passive refs are for internal operations) and
(re)examine how that relates to scrub and repair.

Mostly I tripped over "but repair needs to use passive references once
the AG has had it's state changed to "offline" -- currently, repair uses
the same perag reference that scrub _gets.  If scrub now gets an
"active" reference and something needs repair, do we mark the AG offline
and keep the active reference?  Or downgrade it to a passive reference?

I've (tried to) design scrub & repair as if they were just another pile
of higher level code that uses libxfs to manipulate metadata, just like
fallocate and reflink and all those types of things.  But then, I was
designing for a world where there's only one type of AG reference. :)

Ok, hungry now, wandering off in search of dinner...
