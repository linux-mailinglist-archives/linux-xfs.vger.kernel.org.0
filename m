Been that way since 1995:

commit fdae46676ab5d359d02d955c989b20b18e2a97f8
Author: Adam Sweeney <ajs@sgi.com>
Date:   Thu May 4 20:54:43 1995 +0000

    275579 - - Fix timing bug in the log callback code.  Callbacks
    must be queued until the incore log buffer goes to the dirty
    state.

......
               /*
+                * Keep processing entries in the callback list
+                * until we come around and it is empty.  We need
+                * to atomically see that the list is empty and change
+                * the state to DIRTY so that we don't miss any more
+                * callbacks being added.
+                */
                spl = LOG_LOCK(log);
+               cb = iclog->ic_callback;
+               while (cb != 0) {
+                       iclog->ic_callback_tail = &(iclog->ic_callback);
+                       iclog->ic_callback = 0;
+                       LOG_UNLOCK(log, spl);
+
+                       /* perform callbacks in the order given */
+                       for (; cb != 0; cb = cb_next) {
+                               cb_next = cb->cb_next;
+                               cb->cb_func(cb->cb_arg);
+                       }
+                       spl = LOG_LOCK(log);
+                       cb = iclog->ic_callback;
+               }
+
+               ASSERT(iclog->ic_callback == 0);

THat's likely also what the locking I removed in the previous patch
was attempting to retain - atomic transition to DIRTY state -
without really understanding if it is necessary or not.

The only way I can see this happening now is racing with shutdown
state being set and callbacks being run at the same time a commit
record is being processed. But now we check for shutdown before we
add callbacks to the iclog, and hence we can't be adding callbacks
while shutdown state callbacks are being run. And that's made even
more impossible by this patch set that is serialising all the
shutdown state changes and callback add/remove under the same
lock....

So, yeah, this is largely behaviour that is historic and the
situation that it avoided is unknown and almost certainly doesn't
exist anymore...

Cheers,

Dave.
