IIRC the idea was that it should do 7-bit ASCII only, so even accepting
Latin 1 characters seems like a bug compared to what it was documented
to do.

That works fine if all you care is classic Linux / Unix users.  And
while I'd prefer if all the world was like that, the utf8 based CI
has real use cases.  Initially mostly for Samba file serving, but
apparently Wine also really benefits from it, so some people have CI
directories for that.  XFS ignoring this means we are missing out on
those usrers.

The irony is all the utf8 infrastruture was developed for XFS use
by SGI, never made it upstream back then and got picked up for ext4.
And while it is objectively horrible, plugging into this actually
working infrastructure would be the right thing for XFS instead
of the whacky ASCII only mode only done as a stepping stone while
the utf8 infrastructure got finished.
