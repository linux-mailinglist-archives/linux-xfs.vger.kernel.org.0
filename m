Hello Eric,

I was running fsck on the 1.5PB fs (I interrupted it, as it doesn't seem
to be the main problem now). Large files are archives of videofiles from camera
streaming software, I don't know much about them, I was told at the beginning
that all writes will be sequential, which apparently are not, so for new
files, we'll be preallocating them.

btw blocked read from file I sent backtrace seems to have started finally (after
maybe an hour) and runs 8-20MB/s
