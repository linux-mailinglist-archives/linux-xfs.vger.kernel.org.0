Yeah, I agree this is a wart. Another option I thought about was
creating a new flag to declare which iteration mode a particular
operation uses, if for nothing else but to improve clarity.

FWIW my first pass at finding a solution here was actually with intent
to convert everything over, but then I got lost in the weeds of all the
various operations and gave up. I didn't want to spend forever changing
every op over for something before it was shown to work or be useful, so
my thought process was more to try and see this through for zero range
and if that pans out, follow up with changing everything else over as a
later step.

That said, this was early on before I had the idea fleshed out and I
don't recall all the details. I'll make a note to do another audit pass
at this and see how feasible it is. I suppose my immediate question on
that is: suppose the folio batch thing just doesn't pan out for whatever
reason.. would we think this is a worthwhile iteration cleanup on its
own?
