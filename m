Hello! I upgraded xfsprogs to 6.9.0, and tested the latest code
(reverted jump_label.c related code), but still no problems with the
test, maybe there is a problem with my other environment configuration?
Here is my configuration:

export FSTYP=xfs
export TEST_DEV=/dev/vdb
export TEST_DIR=/tmp/test
mkdir /tmp/test -p
export SCRATCH_DEV=/dev/vde
export SCRATCH_MNT=/tmp/scratch
mkdir /tmp/scratch -p
export TEST_LOGDEV=/dev/vdc
export TEST_RTDEV=/dev/vdd
export TEST_FS_MOUNT_OPTS="-o rtdev=/dev/vdd -o logdev=/dev/vdc"
export MKFS_OPTIONS="-f -m reflink=0,rmapbt=0 -d rtinherit=1 -l size=1g"
export USE_EXTERNAL=yes
echo xfs/556
./check xfs/556


However, this patch is not the final version, and I found another
statistical issue with fsmap locally. In addition, Darrick also found a
boundary-case bug in the patch, which may be responsible for the scrub 
indefinitely? I'm not sure. Anyway, I'll fix it again and test it, and
hopefully pass the test next time.

Thanks,
Zizhi Wo
