Since currently even xfs_perag_put() reaches zero, it won't free
the per-ag anyway (it may just use to mark the pointer is no longer
used in the context? not sure what's the exact use of the such pairs),
so in practice I think after active/passive references are introduced,
there is still the only one real reference count that works for the
per-ag lifetime management and currently it doesn't manage whole
lifetime at all...

So (my own understanding is) I think in practice, that approachs
would be somewhat equal to relocate/rearrange xfs_perag_get()/put()
pair to manage the perag lifetime instead. and maybe use xfs_perag_ptr()
to access perag when some reference count is available.
