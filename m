This does not force the user to use XFS_RT, it only makes that feature
available for someone wanting to format e.g. an SMR HDD with XFS.
I am not sure how "costly" enabling XFS_RT is if it is not used. There is for
sure some xfs code size increase, but beside that, is it really an issue ?

Well, it is nicer for the average user who may not be aware that this feature
is needed for zoned block devices. mkfs.xfs will not complain and format an SMR
HDD even if XFS_RT is disabled. But then mount will fail with a message that
the average user will have a hard time understanding. This is the goal of this
patch: making life easier for the user by ensuring that features that are
needed to use XFS on zoned storage are all present, if zoned storage is
supported by the kernel.

I have not changed this line. It was there and I kept it as-is.
Checking xfsprogs v6.15 man pages, at least mkfs.xfs page is a little light on
comments about zoned block device support. Will improve that there.
