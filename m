Right, that's because hash collision resolution is very dumb. It's
just a linear walk from start to end comparing the names of each
coliding entry.

That's worst case behaviour, not real-world production behaviour.
It's also a dabtree optimisation problem, not a parent pointer
problem. i.e. if this is a real world issue, we need to fix the
dabtree indexing, not work around it in the parent pointer format.

IOWs, optimising the parent pointer structure for the *rare* corner
case of an intentionally crafted dahash btree collision farm is, to
me, the wrong way to design a structure.

Optimising it for the common fast path (single parent xattrs,
followed by small numbers of parents) is what we should be doing,
because that situation will occur an uncountable number of times
more frequently than this theorectical worst case behaviour. i.e.
the worst case will, in all likelihood, never happen in production
environments - behaviour in this circumstance is only a
consideration for mitigating malicious attacks.

And, quite frankly, nobody is going to bother attacking a filesystem
this way - there is literally nothing that can be gained from
slowing down access to a single directory in this manner. It's a DOS
at best, but there are *much* easier ways of doing that and it
doesn't require parent pointers or dahash collisions at all.

So why not change the dahash for parent pointer enabled filesystems
to use crc32c everywhere?

I'd much prefer we have a parent pointer index key that is fixed
length, has constant hash time and a dabtree hash that is far more
resilient to collision farming than to have to perform
encoding/decoding of varaible length values into the key to work
around a collision-rich hashing algorithm.

Cheers,

Dave.
