This series doesn't apply to 5.14-rc4, probably because of the changes
we made in "xfs: fix log cache flush regressions and bugs".  I'd ask if
you could rebase this (and the "make CIL pipelining work" series)
against for-next, except that found regressions with one of Allison's
patches, so I had to kick that one out and restart all the QA stuff.

Between that and fixing all the annoying indentation and whitespace
problems, the 5.15 merge branch isn't going to be ready for for-next
until Wednesday's tree build... and that's why there's still no for-next
in my tree.
