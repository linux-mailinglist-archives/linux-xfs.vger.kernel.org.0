No. xfs_open_by_handle() requires root permissions because it
bypasses lots of security checks, such as parent directory
permissions, ACLs and security labels.

e.g. backups under a root-only directory heirarchy should not be
accessible to users because users are not allowed to traverse into
those root:root 0700 backup directories because permissions on the 
directory inodes do not allow non-root users to enter them.

Hence ...

... the user doesn't actually own that file, even though it has
their own UID in it...

That's not really a user case xfs_restore is intended to support.
It's an admin tool to be run by admins, not end users....

Cheers,

Dave.
