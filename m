I was going to suggest creating an xfs_metadump image for analysis.
Was that created with xfsprogs v6.5.0 as well?

so the metadump did not complete?

Does the filesystem mount? Can you mount it -o ro or -o ro,norecovery
to see how much you can read off of it?

If mount fails, what is in the kernel log when it fails?

Power losses really should not cause corruption, it's a metadata journaling
filesytem which should maintain consistency even with a power loss.

What kind of storage do you have, though? Corruption after a power loss often
stems from a filesystem on a RAID with a write cache that does not honor
data integrity commands and/or does not have its own battery backup.
