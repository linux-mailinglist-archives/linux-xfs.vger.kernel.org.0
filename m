At this point in time, what you mean by the 'original' patch? :) Yours? Or
Dave's?

If you meant yours, I was just trying to find out a way to fix it without
modifying the callers, nothing else than that.

If you meant regarding Dave's proposal, as he tagged his proposal as a /* Hack
*/, I was just looking for ways to change total, instead of cropping it to 0.

And giving the fact args.total > blen seems unreasonable, giving it will
certainly tail here, I just thought it might be a reasonable way to change
args.total value.

By no means this patchset was meant to supersede yours or Dave's idea though, I
was just looking for a different approach, if feasible.

Afaik, yes, but still, total is basically used to attempt an allocation of data
+ metadata on the same AG if possible, reducing args.total to match blen, the
'worst' case would be to have an allocation of data + metadata on different ags,
which, if total is larger than blen, it will fall into that behavior anyway.
