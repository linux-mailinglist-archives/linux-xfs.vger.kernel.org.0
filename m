FWIW, we have precedence for that - see xfs_inactive_ifree(), which
logs errors noisily because we can't return errors to the VFS inode
teardown path (i.e. evict -> destroy_inode -> xfs_fs_destroy_inode
-> xfs_inactive path).

These were originally added because a static error return checker
flagged xfs_inactive() as a place where errors were silently ignored
and users had no indication that somethign bad had happened to their
file. -> release -> xfs_file_release -> xfs_release is no different
in this respect....

Cheers,

Dave.
