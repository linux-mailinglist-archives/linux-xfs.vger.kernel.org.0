Comment on the overall structure of this file now I've been trying
to navigate through it for a little while. It is structured like:

<some attri stuff>
<some attrd stuff>
static const struct xfs_item_ops xfs_attrd_item_ops = {...}
<some more attri stuff>
static const struct xfs_item_ops xfs_attri_item_ops = {...}
<some attri log recovery stuff>
<some attrd log recovery stuff>

IOWs, the attri and attrd functions are interleaved non-obvious
ways and that makes it hard to navigate around when trying to find
related information. It would make more sense to me to structure
this as:

<attri stuff>
<attri log recovery stuff>
<some attrd stuff>
<attrd log recovery stuff>
static const struct xfs_item_ops xfs_attri_item_ops = {...}
const struct xlog_recover_item_ops xlog_attri_item_ops = {...}
static const struct xfs_item_ops xfs_attrd_item_ops = {...}
const struct xlog_recover_item_ops xlog_attrd_item_ops = {...}

because then all the related functionality is grouped together. It
also puts all the ops structures together in the one place, so we
don't have to jump around all over the file when just looking at
what ops the items run at different times...

Cheers,

Dave.
