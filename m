Hm, are you talking about lowmode allocations and the "retry with fewer
constraints" behavior in xfs_bmap_btalloc?

Does that need fixing?

Does doing this affect the outcome of where bmbt blocks get allocated
with respect to whichever data extent allocation triggered the reshaping
of the bmbt?  I would imagine that it /could/ result in somewhat better
allocation decisions?  But that the primary outcome of these two patches
is that a large fallocate on a filesystem with alignment hints and small
AGs (relative to the fallocate request size) are more likely to spit out
aligned extents?

The code changes look ok, but at the same time I wonder if there's a
bigger picture I'm missing?  FWIW that might just be due to Dave and
Carlos discussing something resulting in the "A small improvement in the
allocation algorithm" series and just a gut feeling that better
coordination (or maintainer soothing :P) is needed.
