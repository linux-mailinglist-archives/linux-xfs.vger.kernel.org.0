Thanks, I've addressed all comments in these two reviews in v2:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20201113015044.844213-1-hsiangkao@redhat.com

As for LITINO itself, btw, what would be the suggested name for this?
I'm not good at naming, and will seek time working on cleaning up this.

Will seek time on this later as well.

Yeah, sorry for ignoring this original bugreport, since I thought
the original bugzilla couldn't open publicly.
 https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1894177

It would be better to get a "Tested-by:" tag to check the original
case for v2. :)

I'm fine with either way, since my starting point was to address
the regression of e9e2eae89ddb as I mentioned on IRC. And it can
also be simply fixed directly.
