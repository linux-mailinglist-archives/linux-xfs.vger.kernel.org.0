Those warnings/asserts that exist now indicate something is wrong and
that free space accounting is likely about to become corrupted, because
an otherwise clean inode is being reclaimed with stale delalloc blocks.

I see there's an error injection knob (XFS_ERRTAG_REDUCE_MAX_IEXTENTS)
tied to the max extent count checking stuff in the delalloc conversion
path. You should be able to add some (10+) extents to a file and then
turn that thing all the way up to induce a (delalloc conversion)
writeback failure and see exactly what I'm talking about [1].

[1] The following occurs with this patch, but not on mainline because the
purpose of ->discard_folio() is to prevent it.

(/mnt/file has 10+ preexisting extents beyond the 0-5k range)

# echo 1 > /sys/fs/xfs/vdb1/errortag/reduce_max_iextents
# xfs_io -fc "pwrite 0 5k" -c fsync /mnt/file
wrote 5120/5120 bytes at offset 0
5 KiB, 5 ops; 0.0000 sec (52.503 MiB/sec and 53763.4409 ops/sec)
fsync: File too large
# umount /mnt/
