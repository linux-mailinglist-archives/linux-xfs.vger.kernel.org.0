A signed s64 comparison would just break the diff_two_keys function
again.  The reason for the big dorky comment is to point out that the
signed comparison doesn't work for xfs_btree_query_all, because it does:

	union xfs_btree_key		low_key;
	union xfs_btree_key		high_key;

	memset(&cur->bc_rec, 0, sizeof(cur->bc_rec));
	memset(&low_key, 0, sizeof(low_key));
	memset(&high_key, 0xFF, sizeof(high_key));

	return xfs_btree_simple_query_range(cur, &low_key, &high_key, fn, priv);

The query range function compares each record's key against high_key to
decide if it's time to stop.  Since br_startoff is set to all 1s, if you
force a unsigned 64-bit comparison then you'll correctly iterate all the
records because all records in the bmbt will have:

	br_startoff < 18446744073709551615ULL

and it'll iterate until there are no more bmbt records.  If you do a
signed 64-bit comparison, however, it'll gate its comparison on this:

	br_startoff < -1LL

which is always false, so _query_range exits without iterating
anything.

I wouldn't mind you cooking up a patch (I think I'm going to be busy
for a few hours digging through all of Dave's patches) but the helper
needs to be cmp_u64.  Though ... I also think the logic in the patched
bmbt diff_two_keys is easy enough to follow along.

(Personally I find the subtraction logic harder to follow, though it
generates less asm code on x64...)
