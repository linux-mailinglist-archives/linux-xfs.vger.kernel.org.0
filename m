...could be expanded to elaborate on the problem statement, the
historical behavior, and why we didn't change the verifier.

	/*
	 * This comment describes a historic gap in this verifier
	 * function.
	 *
	 * On older kernels, the extent size hint verifier doesn't check
	 * that the extent size hint is an integer multiple of the
	 * realtime extent size on a directory with both RTINHERIT and
	 * EXTSZINHERIT flags set.  The verifier has always enforced the
	 * alignment rule for regular files with the REALTIME flag set.
	 *
	 * If a directory with a misaligned extent size hint is allowed
	 * to propagate that hint into a new regular realtime file, the
	 * result will be that the inode cluster buffer verifier triggers
	 * corruption shutdowns the next time it is run.
	 *
	 * Unfortunately, there could be filesystems with these
	 * misconfigured directories in the wild, so we cannot add a
	 * check to this verifier at this time because that will result
	 * in new corruption errors when loading existing directory
	 * inodes.  Instead, we permit the misconfiguration to pass
	 * through the verifiers so that callers of this function can
	 * make corrections and mitigations externally.
	 */

How does that sound for the next round?
