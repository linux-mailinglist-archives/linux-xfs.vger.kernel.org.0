I don't like the way the patchset is built. It creates temporary
infrastructure, then tears it down again to return the code to
almost exactly the same structure that it originally had. In doing
this, you change the semantics of functions and helpers multiple
times yet, eventually, we end up with the same semantics as we
started with.

It's much more obvious to factor out the end helpers first, with the
exact semantics that the current have and will end up with, and then
just convert and clean up the code in and around those helpers. It's
much easier to follow and very correct if the function call
semnatics and behaviour don't keep changing...

A null check in the freeing code is much simpler to understand at a
glance. It's easy to miss that the error handling only works because
callers have a single extra line of code that makes error handling
work correctly. This is a bad pattern because it's easy for new code
to get it wrong and have nobody notice that it's wrong.

Ah, what new code? factoring out the _alloc_pages() code at the same
time as the alloc_kmem() code is the only "new" code that is
necessary. Everything else is then consolidation, and this doesn't
require repeatedly changing behaviour and moving code out and back
into helpers....

I've re-written my patch based on this cleanup series. It largely
does all the same things, and ends up largely in the same place, but
does things in an order that doesn't keep changing behaviour and
repeatedly moving the same code around. I'll post it once I've QA'd
it.

Cheers,

Dave.
