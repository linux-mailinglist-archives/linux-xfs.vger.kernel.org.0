If the target that we salvage has the same strlen as i_size, then we'll
rewrite what we found into the symlink.  In all other cases, yes, we
write out the DUMMY_TARGET string.

IOWs, the comment is out of date.  Here's what I have now:

/*

 * ====================
 *
 * We repair symbolic links by reading whatever target data we can find, up to
 * the first NULL byte.  If the recovered target strlen matches i_size, then
 * we rewrite the target.  In all other cases, we replace the target with an

 * commits the new symlink target to the file being repaired.

Oops.  Fixed both of those things.  :(

Yes.  In that case, xrep_symlink_rebuild will fail to write DUMMY_TARGET
into sc->tempip, we ifree the tempfile (with its '.' target), and return
the error to userspace.
