Yes, and it's been a constant source of use-after free bugs in
shutdown processing for as long as I can remember. I want to fix it
so we don't have to keep band-aiding this code every time we change
how some part of log item or stale inode/buffer processing works...

Yes, and that's the problem that needs fixing. The AIL needs a
reference so that we aren't racing with writeback from the AIL to
free the object because both sets of code run without actually
holding an active reference to the BLI...

Who cares? If something else has active references, then we must not
free the bli or buffer here, anyway. The lack of active references
by active BLI usres is why we keep getting use-after-free bugs in
this code.....

Yes. I did say "untested" which implies the patch isn't complete or will
work. It's just a demonstration of how this reference counting might
be done, not a complete, working solution. Patches are a much faster
way of explaining the overall solution that plain text...

If the AIL has a reference, then no.

That's easy enough to handle - if the buffer is stale and we are in
this code, we hold the buffer locked. Hence we can remove from the
AIL if it is in the AIL and drop that reference, too. Indeed, this
code already does the AIL removal, so all this requires is a simple
rearrangement of the logic in this function....

The only difference is that we have to do this before we drop the
current reference we have on the BLI, which is not what we do now
and that's where all the problems lie.

And so leaving the underlying problem in the code for the next set
of changes someone does to trigger the problem in a differen way.
We've indentified what the root cause is, so can we please spend
the time to fix it properly?

Cheers,

Dave.
