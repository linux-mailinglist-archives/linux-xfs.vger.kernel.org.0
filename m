This seems like a reasonable compromise - knowing when updates are
expected goes a long way to being able to plan development and
schedule dev tree updates to avoid repeated rebasing.

IMO it's too late at -rc8 to be including big new changes for the
merge window. Bug fixes are fine, but not cleanups or features at
this point because there's too little test and soak time to catch
brown paper bag bugs before it's in the mainline tree and in much
more widespread use.

Same goes for merging new stuff during the merge window - last time
around we had updates right up to the merge window, then an update
during the merge window for a second pull request. There just wasn't
any time when the tree wasn't actively moving forward.

From my perspective, an update from for-next after the -rc6 update
gets me all the stuff that will be in the next release. That's the
major rebase for my work, and everything pulled in from for-next
starts getting test coverage a couple of weeks out from the merge
window.  Once the merge window closes, another local update to the
-rc1 kernel (which should be a no-op for all XFS work) then gets
test coverage for the next release. -rc1 to -rc4 is when
review/rework for whatever I want merged in -rc4/-rc6 would get
posted to the list....

This means there's a single rebase event a cycle at -rc6, and the
rest of the time the tree is pretty stable and the base tree I'm
testing is almost always the tree that we need to focus dev testing
on. That is, just before the merge window everyone should be testing
for-next on a -rc6/-rc7 base, and once -rc1 is out, everyone should
be testing that kernel through to ~-rc4 at which point it has
largely stabilised and the cycle starts again....

Perhaps:

- each patch set that is posted should start with "this is aimed at
  a 5.x.y-rc4/-rc6 merge" or "still work in progress" so that
  everyone has some expectation of when changes are likely to land.

or:

- aim to land features and complex bug fixes in -rc4 and cleanups in
  -rc6, that way we naturally minimise the rebase work for the
  features/bug fixes that are being landed. This may mean that -rc4
  is a small merge if there are no features/bug fixes that meet the
  -rc4 merge criteria...

Cheers,

Dave.
