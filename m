OK, I'll move this test to tests/generic by using FSTYP.

Yeah, rename_whiteout task run faster than create_file task, so maybe
we can set two different files counts for them to reduce the test run
time. This test ran for 380s on my vm with the fixed kernel, but we
still need to find a way to reduce the run time, like the 19 minutes
case. Actually, in most cases, the deadlock happened when the
rename_whiteout task completed renaming hundreds of files. 50000
is set just because this test take 380s on my vm which is acceptable
and the reproduce possibility is near 100%. So maybe we can choose a
proper files count to make the test runs faster. Of course, I'll
also try to use fsstresss and the TIME_FACTOR if they can help to
reduce the run time.
