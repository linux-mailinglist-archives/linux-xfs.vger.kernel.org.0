OH.  I misread that sentence with "fall back to a more accurate reserve
call", and totally thought that your suggestion was to use
xfs_trans_alloc_quota on its own, then later when we know how much quota
we really want, using xfs_trans_reserve_quota to adjust the transaction.

I am totally ok with doing it this way.

I think it will.

In the end there isn't any practical difference; I had to get over my
reluctance to fiddle around with code that can't ever be run.  Whatever
the state of rt quota, at least users can't get to it.

With that... between the long delivery delays and replies arriving out
of order and with unpredictable lag time, it might just be time for me
to tidy up my patchsets and send a v5.
