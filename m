Yes, I got that from the code.  But I'm a bit confused about the
comment treating the old allocbt blocks as free space, while the code
doesn't.  Or I guess the confusion is that we really have two slightly
different notions of "free space":

  1) the space we try to build the trees for
  2) the space used as free space to us for the trees

The old allocbt blocks are part of 1 but not of 2.

But that means we can't repair the allocation btrees for this case.

Oh, and .has applies to both checking and repairing.  Gt it.

Ok.  Maybe throw in a comment that it just is a convenience wrapper?
