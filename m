Hi all,

Here's a v3 of the near allocation mode extent rework algorithm. The
most obvious difference from v2 is that I've dropped the by-size and
exact mode algorithm reworks and subsequent refactoring from the series
for now. It became a bit unwieldy to keep everything together with all
of the refactoring and whatnot, so I'll plan to follow up with those
bits once the near mode algorithm and associated factoring is settled.
Refer to the previous version(s) for an idea of how this approach
facilitates reuse by the other allocation modes.

Another notable change from v2 is reintroduction of the "last block
scan" in the near mode algorithm. I found that this logic tends to
dominate on allocations from a clean filesystem for quite some time, so
this change adds some consistency between current behavior/performance
and with this patch and makes the fundamental algorithm change a bit
more conservative. From an algorithmic perspective, this change now
essentially enhances the fallback algorithm from a pure bnobt span to a
combined bnobt/cntbt span for improved worst case performance at a
slight cost in locality.

This version has been more thoroughly tested than the previous versions.
I've run fstests with various configurations without regression and some
performance tests to compare with the existing allocator with regard to
performance and resulting allocation locality. While the latter is a bit
ad hoc, it provides some data as to how much this patch changes locality
allocations over time. IOW, the locality data is not necessarily for
deep analysis or detailed comparison of locality between the algorithms,
but rather to provide a data point that locality is still effective with
the algorithm change.

I'll append some raw data to the end of this mail for some of the more
recent filebench tests. For context, each test runs on the same 16xcpu
128GB RAM box against the same striped lvm volume. The test is a simple
64x concurrent file write+fsync of a random distribution of file sizes
from 4k to 500MB to fill up ~70% of a 500GB (16 AGs) fs. The locality
output is from a hacked up version of the xfs_io 'frag' command to scan
for and measure distances of known near mode allocations from the
presumed hint (i.e., the previous extent in a file or the inode location
for initial extents). The largest histogram bucket is the AG size and
represents AG switches (i.e., an allocation occurred on an external AG
from the locality hint).

The first set of tests are run against a clean filesystem and show
comparable performance and locality between the original and updated
algorithms. The second set of tests prepopulates the filesystem and
creates a sequence of randomly sized free space extents before the test
runs. This test is designed to stress the updated algorithm by creating
a large set of unique and randomly sized free extents. Not surprisingly,
this test shows slightly degraded performance for the updated algorithm
when compared to the baseline. While this is not quite an apples to
apples comparison, this is a significantly milder degradation than what
occurs when the baseline algorithm encounters its worst case free space
layout (refer to the v1 cover letter for details). Note that both
variants of the test were repeated a couple times but I'm only including
one set of output for each since the runs were similar.

An interesting design note related to the performance results is that
some followup experimentation shows that the performance is fairly
sensitive to the search key increment aggressiveness implemented in
xfs_alloc_lookup_iter(). This controls how aggressive we search for
ideal locality in the lookup algorithm once we've already found one
suitable maxlen extent. The currently implemented approach is to visit
each set of equal size extents until we have an allocation candidate and
from that point forward, double the search cur key to optimize the scan
of the rest of the tree for better locality. A hack to this logic to
exit on the first available extent can turn the above slight performance
degradation into an overall improvement at the cost of random locality
(i.e., this basically becomes a by-size allocation). I've played around
with this a bit to try and improve this heuristic and close the gap from
the current algorithm, including even considering some form of sysfs
knob to tune behavior (even if just for debug/testing), but so far I
haven't come up with anything preferable to the simplicity of the
current approach that doesn't negatively affect the effectiveness of the
allocator with respect to locality.

Thoughts, reviews, flames appreciated.

Brian

v3:
- Drop by-size and exact allocation rework bits.
- Add near mode last block scan.
- Add debug mode patch to randomly toggle near mode algos.
- Refactor cursor setup/lookup logic.
- Refactor minlen reverse scan to be common between near mode algos.
- Fix up logic to consistently prioritize extent size over locality.
- Add more useful tracepoints.
- Miscellaneous bug fixes and code/comment cleanups.
v2: https://marc.info/?l=linux-xfs&m=155854834815400&w=2
- Lift small mode refactoring into separate patch (retained review
  tag(s).
- Various logic cleanups and refactors.
- Push active flag down into btree cursor private area; eliminate cursor
  container struct.

  caller and factor out accounting.                                                                                                                     
- Fix up tracepoints.
v1: https://marc.info/?l=linux-xfs&m=155742169729590&w=2
- Continued development (various fixes, refinements) on generic bits and
  near mode implementation.
- Added patches 4-6 to refactor exact, by-size and small allocation
  modes.
rfcv2: https://marc.info/?l=linux-xfs&m=155197946630582&w=2
- Dropped spurious initial refactoring.
- Added minlen functionality.
- Properly tied into near alloc path.
- General refactoring and cleanups.
