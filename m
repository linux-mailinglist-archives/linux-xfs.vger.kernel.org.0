This means we can have dquots with no references that aren't on
the free list and aren't actually referenced by any inode, either.

So if we now shut down the filesystem, what frees these dquots?
Are we relying on xfs_qm_dqpurge_all() to find all these dquots
and xfs_qm_dqpurge() guaranteeing that they are always cleaned
and freed?

Cheers,

Dave.
