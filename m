Hi, Dave,

How do you think about the following fix:

1. use autoremove_wake_func(), and remove remove_wait_queue() to
avoid UAF.
2. add finish_wait().

@@ -576,12 +576,13 @@ xlog_wait(
                 __releases(lock)
  {
         DECLARE_WAITQUEUE(wait, current);
+       wait.func = autoremove_wake_function;

         add_wait_queue_exclusive(wq, &wait);
         __set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
         spin_unlock(lock);
         schedule();
-       remove_wait_queue(wq, &wait);
+       finish_wait(wq, &wait);
  }

Best regards!
Yu Kuai
