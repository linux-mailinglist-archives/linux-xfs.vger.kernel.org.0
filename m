<nod> I've wondered if we just have to record (dir_ino/name) ->
(newname) and use that to update the parent pointer and any dabtree
entries we find.  That's going to be a bit of a mess to iron out since
we can't change the "mounted" filesystem.

<nod> Sorry, that was my kneejerk reaction to "let's go reopen this
thing and go back to where you were a week ago".  I appreciate yuor
help getting the online repair patchset ready for merge.

In the end it took about half an hour to put everything back, so I'll go
test that overnight and let's see where we end up tomorrow.
