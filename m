Agreed. :)

Welll... in theory, if some user has hooked up xfs_admin to a program
that expects output lines in an exact order, reordering the commands
would be a breaking change.

Also, if ordering matters to the underlying xfs_db/xfs_io process, then
reordering causes problems if, say, the parameters actually change
things on the filesystem, and the order of those changes matters.

(I don't think any of the fs change options actually do matter, at least
not the ones that apply to v5 filesystems.)

Yep.

I don't think it is.

Yeah.  I'm sure we could come up with some pathological sequence where
multiple invocations would actually break very badly -- if, say, we were
to allow xfs_db to "add" reflink and/or rmap to a filesystem, we'd want
to set the NEEDSREPAIR bit to force the user to run xfs_repair to
generate the missing btrees.

But what if you did something like:

xfs_admin -O rmap <some other option> -O reflink

which would translate to:

xfs_db -c 'add rmap' $dev
<dev is now marked NEEDSREPAIR>
<other option>
xfs_db -c 'add reflink' $dev
<fails because NEEDSREPAIR set at xfs_db init time>

whereas this:

xfs_admin -O rmap -O reflink

would translate to:

xfs_db -c 'add rmap' -c 'add reflink' $dev
<single command, succeeds>

Or maybe we just don't care if any of that is broken because this is all
theoretical. :P

Ok, let's run with this then. :D
