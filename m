Mixing up error pointers and NULL checking is a common bug.  We never
hit this in run time these days because we've been using static analysis
to prevent it for over a decade.

If you look at the code we used to ship in the 2006 era it's absolutely
amazing (bad).  Static analysis isn't perfect for everything but there
are some kinds of simple bugs where we've almost eliminated them
completely.

In this case Smatch is looking at the implementation.

$ smdb return_states shmem_file_setup | grep INTER
mm/shmem.c | shmem_file_setup | 2229 |  4096-ptr_max|        INTERNAL | -1 |                      | struct file*(*)(char*, llong, ulong) |

I also manually reviewed the function implementation to verify.

If someone changes it to return NULL then there are a few things to
note.

1) That person is going to have change all the call sites.
2) Normally when a function returns both error pointers and NULL then
   the NULL is success. So this code doesn't handle the normal case
   correctly because it assumes NULL is an error.
3) Static checkers will complain if the call sites are not updated.  Try
   to find any IS_ERR vs NULL bugs in the past year that were found at
   run time instead of through static analysis.  Occasionally syzbot
   will hit them before me but it's rare.  I don't even remember the
   last time where this sort of bug managed to reach actual users.

Fair enough.  I should have seen Yang Yingliang's email.
