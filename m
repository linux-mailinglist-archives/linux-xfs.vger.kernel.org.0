Ok. So what is the failure message from the test?

When did the test start failing? Is this a recent failure or
something that has been around for years? If it's recent, what
commit broke it?

I don't really follow what you are saying is the problem here - the
rule we are supposed to be following is not clear to me, nor how XFS
is behaving contrary to the rule. Can you explain the rule (e.g.
from the test failure results) rather than try to explain where the
code goes wrong, please?

No, you can't do that. Xattrs cannot be created within the
transaction context of the create operation because they require
their own transaction context to run under. We cannot nest
transaction contexts in XFS, so the ACL and other security xattrs
must be created after the inode create has completed.

Commit e6a688c33238 only initialises the inode attribute fork in the
create transaction rather than requiring a separate transaction to
do it before the xattrs are then created. It does not allow xattrs
to be created from within the create transaction context.

Hence regardless of where the problem lies, a different fix will be
required to address it.

Cheers,

Dave.
