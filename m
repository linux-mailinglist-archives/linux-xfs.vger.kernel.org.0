akamaiedge.net ??

Er, did my mailer do that, or did yours?

That might be true on Windows, but CAP_DAC_* isn't given out by default
on Linux.

I think people would consider it a hole of /some/ kind, since this patch
wouldn't even require the process to hold CAP_DAC_* privilege.

Yes, they can do both of those things, since the Unix DAC only checks
access at open time.

I /did/ say that the BOFH omitted -r... ;)

Yeah.  As far as I can tell, CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE actually /does/ give you
the security permissions that you want.  The sysadmin can then decide
who gets to have that permission, so you /could/ propose doing that.

When would NT be walking through a locally mounted XFS filesystem?
