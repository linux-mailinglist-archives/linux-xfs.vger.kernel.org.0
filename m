Sorry, I had misunderstood the above statement. If we use XFS_MAXDIREXTNUM
(i.e. 2^32) as the maximum extent count for computing rename reservation the
resultant value should be the same as the one computed in existing filesystems
which have MAXEXTNUM set to 2^32. Hence as you have noted, the reservation for
rename operation should not change.

However, other FS operations that use mp->m_bm_maxlevels[xattr fork|non-dir
data fork] (e.g. xfs_calc_write_reservation()) as input for calculating log
reservations, will see an increase in the resultant values since both max
xattr and max data extent count have now been increased. Hence IMHO, the only
way to prevent older kernels from mounting filesystems whose log reservations
have been calculated based on 2^32 (MAXAEXTNUM) and 2^47 (MAXEXTNUM) is to
have an incompat flag set during mkfs time. If we decide to go with
this approach, then we could drop XFS_MAXDIREXTNUM and just continue to use
MAXEXTNUM. Please let me know your opinion this.
