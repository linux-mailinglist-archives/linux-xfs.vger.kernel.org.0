I think we could replace it right now with an in-memory rotor like
the mp->m_agfrotor. It really does not need to be persistent; the
current sequence based algorithm devolves to sequential ascending
block order allocation targets once the sequence number gets large
enough.

Further, the (somewhat) deterministic extent distribution it is
trying to acheive (i.e. even distribution across the rt dev) is
really only acheivable in write-once workloads.  The moment we start
freeing space on the rtdev, the free space is no longer uniform and
does not match the pattern the sequence-based target iterates. Hence
the layout the search target attempts to create is unacheivable and
largely meaningless.

IOWs, we may as well just use an in-memory sequence number or a
random number to seed the allocation target; they will work just as
well as what we have right now without the need for persistent
sequence numbers.

Also, I think that not updating the persistent sequence number is
fine from a backwards compatibility perspective - older kernels will
just use it as it does now and newer kernels will just ignore it...

I say we just kill the whole sequence number in atime thing
completely....

-Dave.
