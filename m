Wait, what?

OH, this is because the LARP state machine can log the inode in the
final transaction in its chain.  __xfs_trans_commit calls the noroll
variant of xfs_defer_finish, which means that when we get to...

...here, tp might actually be a dirty transaction.  Prior to
xlog_cil_committing the dirty transaction, we need to run the precommit
hooks or else we don't actually (re)attach the inode cluster buffer to
the transaction, and everything goes batty from there.  Right?

This isn't specific to LARP; any defer item that logs an item with a
precommit hook is subject to this.  Right?

                       precommits

If the answers to the last 2 questions are 'yes' and the spelling errors
get fixed, I think I'm ok enough with this one to throw it at
fstestscloud.
