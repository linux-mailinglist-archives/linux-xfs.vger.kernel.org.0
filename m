In the original refcount recordset regenerator in xfs_repair, refcount
records are generated from rmap records.  Let's say that the rmap
records are:

{agbno: 10, length: 40...}
{agbno: 11, length: 3...}
{agbno: 12, length: 20...}
{agbno: 15, length: 1...}

It would be convenient to have a data structure that could quickly tell
us the refcount for an arbitrary agbno without wasting memory.  An array
or a list could do that pretty easily.  List suck because of the pointer
overhead.  xfarrays are a lot more compact, but we want to minimize
sparse holes in the xfarray to constrain memory usage.  Maintaining
order isn't critical for correctness, so I created the "rcbag", which is
shorthand for an unordered list of (excerpted) reverse mappings.

So we add the first rmap to the rcbag, and it looks like:

0: {agbno: 10, length: 40}

The refcount for agbno 10 is 1.  Then we move on to block 11, so we add
the second rmap:

0: {agbno: 10, length: 40}
1: {agbno: 11, length: 3}

The refcount for agbno 11 is 2.  We move on to block 12, so we add the
third:

0: {agbno: 10, length: 40}
1: {agbno: 11, length: 3}
2: {agbno: 12, length: 20}

The refcount for agbno 12 and 13 is 3.  We move on to block 14, and
remove the second rmap:

0: {agbno: 10, length: 40}
1: NULL
2: {agbno: 12, length: 20}

The refcount for agbno 14 is 2.  We move on to block 15, and add the
last rmap.  But we don't care where it is and we don't want to expand
the array so we put it in slot 1:

0: {agbno: 10, length: 40}
1: {agbno: 15, length: 1}
2: {agbno: 12, length: 20}

The refcount for block 15 is 3.  Notice how order doesn't matter in this
list?  That's why repair uses an unordered list, or "bag".

That said, adding and removing specific items is now an O(n) operation
because we have no idea where that item might be in the list.  Overall,
the runtime is O(n^2) which is bad.

I realized that I could easily refactor the btree code and reimplement
the refcount bag with an xfbtree.  Adding and removing is now O(log2 n),
so the runtime is at least O(n log2 n), which is much faster.  In the
end, the rcbag becomes a sorted list, but that's merely a detail of the
implementation.  The repair code doesn't care.

(Note: That horrible xfs_db bmap_inflate command can be used to exercise
this sort of rcbag insanity by cranking up refcounts quickly.)
