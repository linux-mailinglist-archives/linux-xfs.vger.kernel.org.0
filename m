For everyone not on #xfs on oftc, here's a summary of the last day
or so since I discovered the above problem.

New xfs/270 failures with the fsconfig/fsopen mount API tell us that
unknown RO-compat bit mounts have also been completely broken since
~2018.

xfs/270 has been shutting down with superblock corruption after
mounting with an unknown RO-compat bit since 2018, but the attempt
to remount rw detects the unknown RO-compat bit before the code
checks for a shutdown situation, and hence the test passes even on a
shut down filesystem. Hence the test passes, and nobody has noticed
that the RO feature compat functionality is completely broken....

Which then lead us to the fact we are using RO-compat bits for
reflink and rmapbt, which introduce new log items and so actually
have log incompat feature bit requirements. RO-compat bits
don't cover recovery of unknown log features, just prevent new
modifications of the filesystem post-mount. So allowing log recovery
when RO-compat feature bits are set is also broken because we
screwed up reflink/rmapbt feature bit definitions, and that's
effective zero-day bugs for those features.

And, well, we modelled the XFS RO-compat functionality on the ext4
feature bit behaviour, so.....

Yup. But I don't see a way to easily avoid that...
