Just because it was the minimum to move about and it clearly
demonstrated the damage the contended cacheline was doing to
performance of code accessing read-only variables.

Really, there's a lot in the xfs_mount that might well be read only
that I didn't consider. I'm thinking that most of the pointers to
structures are read only (e.g. the log, ailp, buftargs, etc) as they
do not change for the life of the structure. I don't really have the
time to dig into this real deep (this is a quick, interesting
diversion!) so I did the 99-percenter and moved on...

Cheers,

Dave.
