Hm.  I /think/ it would be possible but fairly difficult to write an
fstest -- you'd have to create a storage with a very slow DISCARD
command, mount the fs with -o discard, fill the fs, free all the blocks,
make a large directory structure, and then rmdir the directory.  Those
last three steps would have to happen before the discards finish.

Uh... do you think that's worth the effort?  I don't think the kernel
even has a dm driver to simulate a device with only slow discards.

In the meantime,
