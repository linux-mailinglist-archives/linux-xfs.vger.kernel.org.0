From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

Currently the AIL attempts to keep 25% of the "log space" free,
where the current used space is tracked by the reserve grant head.
That is, it tracks both physical space used plus the amount reserved
by transactions in progress.

When we start tail pushing, we are trying to make space for new
reservations by writing back older metadata and the log is generally
physically full of dirty metadata, and reservations for modifications
in flight take up whatever space the AIL can physically free up.

Hence we don't really need to take into account the reservation
space that has been used - we just need to keep the log tail moving
as fast as we can to free up space for more reservations to be made.
We know exactly how much physical space the journal is consuming in
the AIL (i.e. max LSN - min LSN) so we can base push thresholds
directly on this state rather than have to look at grant head
reservations to determine how much to physically push out of the
log.
