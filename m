It will be done silently the next time the inode is cycled through
memory via an open()/close() pair as specualtive prealloc is removed
on the final close() of a file.

Alternatively, you can trigger reclaim on the current set of
in-memory inodes by running:

# xfs_spaceman -c "prealloc -m 64k -s" /mnt

to remove speculative preallocations of more than 64k from all
inodes that are in-memory and wait for the operation to complete.

You still need to bring the inodes into memory, so you can do this
via find command that reads some inode metadata (e.g. find /mnt
-ctime 2>&1 /dev/null). This means you don't need to actually
open/close each inode in userspace - the filesystem will traversal
all the in-memory inodes and clear the prealloc space itself.

Cheers,

Dave.
