Apart from the fact that we should not be overloading some other
transaction reservation definition for this special case? Saying
"it should work" does not justify not thinking about constraints,
layered design, application exposure to error cases, overruns, etc.

i.e. the whole point of the software fallback is to make atomic
writes largely generic. Saying "if we limit them to 16kB" it's not
really generic, is it?

I was thinking more like 4-16MB as a usable maximum size for atomic
writes. i.e. allow for whole file atomic overwrites for small-medium
sized files, and decent IO sizes for performance when overwriting
large files.

If we set the max at 4MB, that's 1024 extents on a 4kB
block size filesystem. That gives us 2048 intents in a single unmap
operation which we can directly calculate the transaction
reservation size it will need. We need to do this as two separate
reservation steps with a max() calculation, because the processing
reservation size reduces with filesystem block size but the extent
unmap intent overhead goes up as the block count increases with
decreasing block size. i.e. the two components of the transacation
reservation scale in different directions.

If we are adding a new atomic transaction, we really need to design
it properly from the ground up, not hack around an existing
transaction reservation whilst handwaving about how "it should be
enough".

This "maximum size" is going to be exposed directly to userspace,
hence we need to think carefully about what the maximum supported
limits are going to be and how we can support them with a minimum of
effort long into the future. Hacking around the existing write
transaction isn't the way to do this, especially as that may change
in future as we modify internal allocation behaviour over time.

Saying "we only need 16kB right now, so that's all we should
support" isn't the right approach to take here....
