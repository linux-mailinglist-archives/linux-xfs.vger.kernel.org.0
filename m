My guess is that syzbot enabled BSD process accounting to a file with FS_SYNC_FL
on an ext4 nojournal fs.  It didn't provide a reproducer itself.  Sure, I'll try
to write a reproducer and include it in the commit message.  I felt it wasn't
quite as important for this one compared to most of the other syzbot bugs, since
BSD process accounting can only be enabled by root, and once we're talking about
do_exit() being able to write an arbitrary file, it's not hard to see why
*something* could get tripped up by PF_MEMALLOC.  There are probably other ways
it could cause problems besides this specific one.  But sure, I'll try.

I already did, that's why at the same time I sent out this patch, I also sent
out one to fix cifs_demultiplex_thread()
(https://lkml.kernel.org/linux-cifs/20200308043645.1034870-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/T/#t).
These were the only two; I didn't find any others that needed to be fixed.
