Thanks, I'll try to improve that.

This is new for me, please let me learn more about that.

Honestly, I don't have an answer for that ATM - it's quite possible.
It certainly needs more investigating. On the other hand - current
lack of feedback causes user discomfort. So I'd like to know your
opinion - should the change proposed by this patch be default
behaviour (as it may be more user friendly) and should we add an
option that would 'revert' to current behaviour (that would be for
informed user).
