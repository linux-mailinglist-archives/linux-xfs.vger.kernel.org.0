Yes.  For patches that don't just repetitively apply similar changes
to a few places, about 20 patches is the max that is digestable.

As someone part of the loop I was a little surprised how quickly you
did respin the patches.  In general if I have feedback that requires
a major rework of a non-trivial series, I do not want to touch it
instantly.  Let the discussion continue a bit, becaue it can easily
turn into another direction and create more work.  I think waiting a few
days before doing anything that involves a lot of work generally helpsto
make everyones life a little easier.

Yes, for any non-trivial series that really, really helps.
