If the log item doesn't have a sort function, it implies the object
is already locked and modified and there's no pre-commit operation
going to be performed on it. In that case, I decided to move them to
the tail of the list so that it would be easier to verify that the
items that need sorting were, indeed, sorted into the correct order.

The choice was arbitrary - the could be moved to the head of the
list or they could be left where they are any everything else is
ordered around them, but I went for the behaviour that it easy to
verify visually with debug output or via a list walk in a debugger...

I put that there because if we are already shut down then there's no
point in even sorting or running pre-commits - they are going to
error out trying to access the objects they need to modify anyway.

It really isn't critical, just seemed superfluous to run code that
we already know will be cancelled and/or error out...

Cheers,

Dave.
