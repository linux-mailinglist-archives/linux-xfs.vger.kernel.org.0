Urrrk, yeah, I didn't realize that tools/ doesn't have a Makefile,
therefore nothing from there get installed.  Three options:

1) Add a tools/Makefile and an install target
2) Update the top level Makefile's install target to install the two
   scripts
3) Move tools/run_* to the top level and (2)

Thoughts?
