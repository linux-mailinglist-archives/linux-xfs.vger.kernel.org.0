Thinking about it again, that still seems way overengineered. All the
percpu batching stuff does is perform a global counter update behind a
spinlock and invoke a lockless read of that counter. AFAICT we can do
the same kind of lockless check on a flag or boolean in the CIL and use
an existing spinlock (as opposed to burying the percpu locks under our
own). Then we don't have to abuse special percpu interfaces at all to
obscurely provide serialization and indirect state.

Ok, that might prohibit using a bitop in the commit path. I'd still like
to see actual numbers on that, though, just to see where on the spectrum
it lands. I'm also wondering if the fast path logic mentioned above
could be implemented like the following (using bitops instead of the
spinlock):

	if (test_bit(XLOG_CIL_EMPTY, ...) &&
	    test_and_clear_bit(XLOG_CIL_EMPTY, ...)) {
		<steal CIL res>
	}

That type of pattern seems to be used in at least a few other places in
the kernel (e.g. filemap_check_errors(), wb_start_writeback(),
__blk_mq_tag_busy()), presumably for similar reasons.
