printk indexing is exposed in debugfs, and we have a long standing 
understanding that debugfs APIs are not stable, and there are no ABI 
guarantees. The statement in the initial patch that the API is "semi-stable" is 
simply wrong.

debugfs has no stability guarantees whatsoever and exists outside of the 
userspace ABI guarantees.[0]

Even if there was some guarantee (which there isn't), the guarantee would be on 
the format of the file, not the data contained within. The point of printk 
indexing is to indicate when things change, not preclude that change. Just as a 
map appearing, changing, or disappearing in /proc/pid/smaps isn't an ABI break, 
this wouldn't be either. It would just be a change in the backing data. For 
example, if a file or line changes, printk indexing helps indicate to a 
userspace tool that the printk may have gone away, or changed location.

Anyone using printk indexing has to accept that both the format and the file 
contents are not stable between kernel releases, and must accommodate for that 
during development. That's the main reason that this was put in debugfs rather 
than (for example) /proc or /sys.

I don't know why Jonathan referred to it as "semi-stable". It is simply not so. 
printk indexing is a completely unstable debugfs API with no guarantees about 
either format or contents to userspace at all over kernel releases.

The policy, as with all debugfs APIs by default, is that it's completely 
unstable and there are no API stability guarantees whatsoever. That's why 
there's no extensive documentation for users: because this is a feature for 
kernel developers.
