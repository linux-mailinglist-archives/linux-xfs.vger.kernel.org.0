grace of God, please understand that you are not helping me rather you
are working for God the creator of heaven and earth. And again widow
suffering from long time illness. i am currently admitted in a privet
hospital in the country, I have some funds I inherited from my late
loving husband Mr. Guessan Martin, the sum of ($8,500,000.00 USD)
which he deposited in BANK Here and I need a very honest and God
fearing Christian that can use this funds for God's work. I want you
and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd.
My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian and whoever
that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth.
Please if you would be able to use these funds for the Lord's work
kindly reply me Don=E2=80=99t forget to always pray for me because all my h=

to survive is in God the creator who holds death and life.
Hoping to receive your reply.
