Go for it! :)

Sounds like a good idea.

Sure, why not?  It's too bad that readahead to an xfile can't
asynchronously call xfile_get_page; maybe we wouldn't need so much
caching.

Especially if it ends up in the xfs_btree stub object that you were
talking about above.  Just be careful not to make the userspace xfile.c
and xfbtree.c too weird -- some of the quirky apis here are a result of
me trying to keep things similar between kernel and xfsprogs.

(and the userspace xfile is weird because we're constrained by the size
of the fd table and hence have to partition memfds)

Ok.
