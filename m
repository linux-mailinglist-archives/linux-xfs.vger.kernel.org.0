Ah, will fix that.

Yeah, I haven't got to that point yet - I'm still chasing a wild
goose that is now only showing up once every 3 or 4 hours of
cyclic testing, so I've been trying to capture that in sufficient
detail to be able to diagnose the failure. I wanted to get these out
there so new eyes might see what I'm missing or suggest a better
approach...

I'll add this split into my patchset tomorrow when I go looking at
the corpses overnight testing created...

Cheers,

Dave.
