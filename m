Do you think we don't know this?

We can't actually rely on the compiler checking here. We *must* to
do runtime verification of these on-disk format structures because
we are parsing dynamic structures, not fixed size arrays.  IOWs, we
already bounds check these arrays (in multiple ways!) before we do
the memcpy(), and have done so for many, many years.

*This code is safe* no matter what the compiler says.

Last time this came up in a FORTIFY_SOURCE context, Darrick proposed
to change this to use unsafe_memcpy() to switch off the compile time
checking because we *must* do runtime checking of the array lengths
provided in the structure itself.

Kees pretty much knocked that down by instead proposing some
"flex_cpy()" API he was working on that never went anywhere. So
kernel security people essentially said "no, we don't want you to
fix it that way, but then failed to provide the new infrastructure
they said we should use for this purpose.

Damned if we do, damned if we don't.

So until someone from the security side of the fence ponies up the
resources to fix this in a way that is acceptible to the security
people and they do all the testing and validation we require for
such an on-disk format change, the status quo is unlikely to change.

<sigh>

I'm really getting tired of all these "you'll do what we say or
else" threats that have been made over the past few months.

As I said: if this is a priority, then the entities who have given
it priority need to provide resources to fix it, not demand that
others do the work they want done right now for free. If anyone
wants work done for free, then they'll just have to wait in line
until we've got time to address it.
