Aha, that's the subtlety I didn't quite catch. :)

Now that I see how this works for the simple case, I guess I'll try to
figure out on my own what would happen if we flooded the system with a
/lot/ of reloggable items.  Though I bet you've already done that, given
our earlier speculating about closing the writeback hole.
