The old free space btree blocks are tracked via old_allocbt_blocks so
that we can reap the space after committing the new btree roots.
Reaping cross-references the set regions in the bitmap against the
rmapbt records so that we don't free crosslinked blocks.

This is a big difference from xfs_repair, which constructs a free space
map by walking the directory / bmbt trees and builds completely new
indexes in the gaps.  It gets away with that because it's building
all the space metadata in the AG, not just the free space btrees.

The next question you might have is why there's old_allocbt_blocks and
not_allocbt_blocks -- this is due to us using the AGFL to supply the
bnobt, cntbt, and rmapbt's alloc_block routines.  Hence the blocks
tracked by all four data structures are all RMAP_OWN_AG, and we have to
do a bit of bitmap work to subtract the rmapbt and AGFL blocks from all
the OWN_AG records to end up with the blocks that we think are owned by
the free space btrees.

Correct.

xrep_abt_reserve_space returns -ENOSPC, so we throw away all the incore
records and throw the errno out to userspace.  Across all the btree
rebuilding code, the block reservation step happens as the very last
thing before we start writing btree blocks, so it's still possible to
back out cleanly.

No.  Checking doesn't require the rmapbt because all we do is walk the
bnobt/cntbt records and cross-reference them with whatever metadata we
can find.

A stronger check would scan the AG to build a second recordset of the
free space and compare that against what's on disk.  However, that would
be much slower, and Dave wanted scans to be fast because corruptions are
supposed to be the edge case. :)

The weaker checking also means we can scrub old filesystems, even if we
still require xfs_repair to fix them.

I didn't want to spend the brainpower to figure out how to make the
macro and va_args crud work to support pushing both from xrep_allocbt ->
xfarray_create -> xfile_create.  I don't know how to make that stuff
nest short of adding a kas- variant of xfile_create.

Seeing as we don't install xfiles into the file descriptor table anyway,
the labels are only visible via ftrace, and not procfs.  I decided that
cleanliness here wasn't a high enough priority.

Yeah.  I suppose one way to clean that up would be to export
xchk_allocbt to the dispatch table in scrub.c instead of
xchk_{bno,cnt}bt and figure out which btree we want from sm_type.

Way back when I was designing scrub I thought that repair would be
separate for each btree type, but that turned out not to be the case.
Hence the awkwardness in the call chains.

This wrapper simplifes the interface to xrep_newbt_add_blocks so that
external callers don't have to know which magic values of xfs_alloc_arg
are actually used by xrep_newbt_add_blocks and therefore need to be set.

For all the other repair functions, they have to allocate space from the
free space btree, so xrep_newbt_add_blocks is passed the full
_alloc_args as returned by the allocator to xrep_newbt_alloc_ag_blocks.

The funny part is that I don't even use it in newbt.c.  Maybe it's time
to get rid of it.

Done.
