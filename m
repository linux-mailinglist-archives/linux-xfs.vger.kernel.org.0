Run the "auto" group tests ('-g auto') only, which will weed out
tests that are broken, likely to fail or crash the machine (i.e.
test-to-failure scenarios). You can ignore "not run" reports - they
aren't failures, just indicative of the kernel not supporting that
functionality (like not being built with DEBUG functionality).

Then run the tests across an unmodified kernel 2-3 times to get a
baseline set of results (should be identical each run), then do the
same thing for the patched kernel.

Now compare baseline vs patched results, looking for things that
failed in the patched kernel that didn't fail in the baseline kernel
- those are the regressions that need more investigation. If there
are no regressions (very likely), you are good to go.

The auto group tests should take ~3-6 hours to run a full cycle
depending on storage config.

Cheers,

Dave.
