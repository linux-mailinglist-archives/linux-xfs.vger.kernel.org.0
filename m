hi,

Sorry for late reply, because I took some time to understand your words and read
source codes, your explanation is great and really help me to understand xfs log
codes now. Appreciate your time, thanks.
Currently we use ext4 widely, but xfs has some advanced features, such as reflink,
there're some users who needs to use these features. Once we have a good knowledge
about xfs, we may have a try in product.

Regards,
Xiaoguang Wang
