Yeah.  Hey Christoph, would you mind pre-pending a minimal fixpatch to
set xfs_trans_set_sync in growfsrt before this one that refactors the
existing growfs/sb updates?

Yeah, I guess you'd have to hold the AGF while forcing the log, wouldn't
you?

What if we redefined the input requirements to shrink?  Lets say we
require that the fd argument to a shrink ioctl is actually an unlinkable
O_TMPFILE regular file with the EOFS blocks mapped to it.  Then we can
force the log without holding any locks, and the shrink transaction can
remove the bmap and rmap records at the same time that it updates the sb
geometry.  The otherwise inaccessible file means that nobody can reuse
that space between the log force and the sb update.

This probably should be different tests, because rt is its own very
weird animal.
