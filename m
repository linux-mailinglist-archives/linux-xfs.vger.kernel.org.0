Yes.  The dabtree hash is calculated on the full attr name, so this is
an attempt to reduce hash collisions during parent pointer lookups by
stuffing as many bytes in the attr name as possible.

It would be very easy to change the xfs_da_hashname calls inside
xfs_parent.c to use either the full dirent name (i.e. pptr hash matches
dirent hash) or use the full parent pointer and not just the attr key,
but that would be a major break from the tradition that the da hash is
computed against the attr name only.

(I'm not opposed to doing that too, but one breaking change at a time.
;))

Yes.  The dabtree can handle an xattr structure where every name hashes
to the same value, though performance will be slow as it scans every
attr to find the one it wants.

The number of parent pointers with the same hash can be much higher
than 2^12 -- I wrote a dumb C program that creates an arbitrary number
of attr names with identical hashes.  It's not fast when you get past
100,000. :P

NP.  Thanks for asking!
