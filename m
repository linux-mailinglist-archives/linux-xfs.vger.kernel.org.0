Source kernel commit: 83193e5ebb0164d612aa620ceab7d3746e80e2a4

While auditing the realtime growfs code, I realized that the GROWFSRT
ioctl (and by extension xfs_growfs) has always allowed sysadmins to
change the realtime extent size when adding a realtime section to the
filesystem.  Since we also have always allowed sysadmins to set
RTINHERIT and EXTSZINHERIT on directories even if there is no realtime
device, this invalidates the premise laid out in the comments added in

In other words, this is not a case of inadequate metadata validation.
This is a case of nearly forgotten (and apparently untested) but
supported functionality.  Update the comments to reflect what we've
learned, and remove the log message about correcting the misalignment.

Fixes: 603f000b15f2 ("xfs: validate extsz hints against rt extent size when rtinherit is set")

 	 * This comment describes a historic gap in this verifier function.

-	 * The verifier has always enforced the alignment rule for regular

+	 * multiple of the realtime extent size.  Since we allow users to set
+	 * this combination  on non-rt filesystems /and/ to change the rt
+	 * extent size when adding a rt device to a filesystem, the net effect
+	 * is that users can configure a filesystem anticipating one rt
+	 * geometry and change their minds later.  Directories do not use the
+	 * extent size hint, so this is harmless for them.
 	 *
 	 * If a directory with a misaligned extent size hint is allowed to
 	 * propagate that hint into a new regular realtime file, the result
 	 * is that the inode cluster buffer verifier will trigger a corruption
-	 * shutdown the next time it is run.

 	 *
-	 * Unfortunately, there could be filesystems with these misconfigured

-	 * at this time because that will result a new source of directory
-	 * corruption errors when reading an existing filesystem.  Instead, we
-	 * permit the misconfiguration to pass through the verifiers so that
