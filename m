Oh, agreed... What I'm saying above is that automatic relogging as
defined here is not intended for tracking progress as such. It simply
moves along an intent that isn't ever modified. If it is modified, it's
the responsibility of the caller to relog/roll/whatever.

>=20

I'm not quite following what you mean by an intent falling off the tail
of the log. This patch modifies quotaoff because it presents a simple
and preexisting example of the problem it attempts to solve. Does this
scenario apply to that use case, or are you considering a more involved
use case here (such as btree reconstruction)?

Ok, so the transaction memory lifecycle was slightly longer compared to
the current model. I take it this was ultimately replaced with the CIL
context.

>=20

Right, but this is exactly why quotaoff doesn't use such a rolling
transaction. The quotaoff sequence itself can produce transaction
allocations from inaccessible contexts (i.e. inode inactivation), so it
can't hold an open transaction during the dquot scanning and whatnot.
Instead, it commits the start intent, performs the necessary work, and
allocates a new transaction for quotaoff_end once it is safe again to
reserve log space. This of course is a deadlock vector because the tail
was pinned from the start, the indirect transaction activity generated
by quotaoff is unknown and the filesystem is still open to unrelated
workloads.

The problem this patch attempts to resolve is simply to keep the start
intent moving in the log, explicitly because it is not modified in any
way that tracks progress of quotaoff.

>=20

Yeah, that makes sense. This is how dfops is essentially designed, but
the purpose of this is to deal with the context issue described above.
It is explicitly intended only for items that have not made progress
updates, but otherwise might be the only object pinning the tail of the
log.

Based on your feedback to this point, it seems to me that you're
expecting that this kind of indirect transaction scenario shouldn't
apply to btree reconstruction. That's fine, it just means that perhaps
these two use cases (from a logging perspective) aren't quite as similar
as I anticipated.

>=20

Yeah, I can see how rolling to maintain the forward progress guarantee
prevents log deadlocks. I could also see how that still leaves practical
issues for long running operations. For example, if the btree
reconstruction phase takes a relative long amount of time without any
transaction commits (and with outstanding intents), then we risk pinning
the log tail and blocking (though not deadlocking) any other unrelated
operations until the repair completes. I suspect this is where the
transaction notification thing comes in, because that provides us the
hook to notify the transaction that "it's time to move this thing
along," whether that be on CIL context checkpoint as I've done here or
something more intelligent down the line.

>=20

Ok. The context provided above helps and I like the idea in general.
I'm still missing some pieces around how this would be used in something
like the btree reconstruction case, however.

Suppose the intents that need relogging are committed with associated
callbacks and context, the btree reconstruction is in progress and the
callback is invoked. Would the callback handler simply just roll the
transaction in this case and relog the attached items? (If the former,
isn't it eventually a deadlock vector to roll from log commit context
once the rolling transaction runs out of ticket counts?). Or are you
anticipating something more complex in terms of the callback notifying
the repair sequence (somehow) that it needs to relog its rolling context
transaction at the next opportunity?

I also think it's worth distinguishing between quotaoff and the repair
use case at this point. As noted above, this doesn't really address the
former and if we do take this callback approach, I'd like to find a way
to apply it there if at all possible. Admittedly, quotaoff is a bit of a
hacky use case as it is, so I'd even be fine with something along the
lines of running it it two separate (but coordinated) tasks[1] (i.e., one
dedicated to rolling and relogging the start intent and another to do
the actual quotaoff work), as long as the approach is ultimately safe
and resolves the problem. Thoughts?

[1] That could be anything from a specific quotaoff task to a more
generic background relog worker that could be shared across users and
batch to fewer transactions.

Yeah, though to be fair you're attributing more responsibility and thus
more complexity than I initially intended for this mechanism. This was
intended to be a "don't deadlock on this unchanged item" mechanism and
thus fairly isolated/limited in use. I'd compare it to something like
ordered buffers in terms of complexity level. I.e., a low level
mechanism for specific use cases and to be managed/understood properly
by associated users.

I've no issue with moving in the direction discussed here to facilitate
more complex higher level mechanisms (like tracking operational progress
of btree reconstruction, etc.), I'm just saying that the complexity
argument you make here changes as the requirements do.

I can definitely see opening up the dfops interface to drive/control
intent relogging vs. progress updates vs. completion. This is somewhat
complicated by tricks like reusing certain intents in non-traditional
ways, such as completing an EFI with an EFD without actually freeing
blocks. Regardless, my questions to this point are more around
usage/semantics of the log commit callback and using it to manage
transaction rolls. Once those building blocks are settled, I'm sure we
can work out a reasonable interface.
