I believe in one of earlier emails in this thread, Brian mentioned
that this is related to "sparse inodes" being enabled:

"I couldn't reproduce this at first because sparse inodes is enabled
by default and that introduces more strict inode alignment requirements."

Can you please try mkfs'ing with spare inodes disabled?

Thanks,
Alex.
