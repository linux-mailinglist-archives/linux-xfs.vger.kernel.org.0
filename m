Partly.. I mentioned in my earlier reply that the geometry structure
doesn't seem like the right place to stuff transaction reservation
related values. An alternative I mentioned would be a new (or update to
the existing) structure that similarly precalculates log reservations,
but I wasn't going to go do that without some discussion/feedback on the
approach. Replacing the macro seemed broadly acceptable, so I sent that
patch as an incremental improvement and to keep the bug fix isolated.

Also, while stuffing a new value in a pre-existing structure might lend
itself to a one-off patch, I'm not sure that creating a new data
structure does lest it fail to justify the existence of the structure
itself. Therefore, it might be better to create a small series to
convert over several values to start such a structure and perhaps do the
rest over time to reduce the churn..

I figured replacing the macro was an incremental improvement independent
from how precalculated transaction block reservations might be
structured. TBH, I don't mind the macros as much as others seem to, so
feel free to defer or discard this patch altogether..

Feel free to comment on my feedback on this in the previous reply..
