Hello,

after the tristate dax option change some applications fail to detect
pmem devices because the dax option no longer shows in mtab when device
is mounted with -o dax.

At first it might seem stupid to detect pmem by looking at the mount
options.

However, if the application actually wants a mount point properly
configured for dax rather than just backed by pmem I do not see any
other easy way.

Also this happens during early installtion steps when the mounted
filesystem is typically empty and you want to perform non-destructive
detection.

If there are better ways to detect dax enabled mount poins I want to
hear all about it. In the meantime we have legacy applications to
support.

It also makes sense that when you mount a device with -o dax it actually
shows dax in the mount options. Not doind so is confusing for humans as
well.

Thanks

Michal

  xfs: show the dax option in mount options.
