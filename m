Right, that's why I want to get this whole mechanism completely
detached from the VFS inode RCU life cycle rules and instead
synchronised by internal IO operations such as log forces.

The code I currently have is based on your changes, just without the
fallback chunk allocation. I'm not really even scanning the irecs;
I just look at the number of free inodes and count the number of
busy inodes over the range of the record. If they aren't the same,
we've got inodes in that record we can allocate from. I only do a
free inode-by-free inode busy check once the irec we are going to
allocate from has been selected.

Essentially, I'm just scanning records in the finobt to find the
first with a non-busy inode. If we fall off the end of the finobt,
it issues a log force and kicks the AIL and then retries the
allocation from the finobt. There isn't any attempt to allocate new
inode chunks in the case, but it may end up being necessary and can
be done without falling back to the outer loops.

i.e. as long as we track whether we've allocated a new inode chunk
or not, we can bound the finobt search to a single retry. If we
allocated a new chunk before entering the finobt search, then all we
need is a log force because the busy inodes, by definition, are
XFS_ISTALE at this point and waiting for a CIL push before they can
be reclaimed. At this point an retry of the finobt scan will find
those inodes that were busy now available for allocation.

If we haven't allocated a new chunk, then we can do so immediately
and retry the allocation. If we still find them all busy, we force
the log...

IOWs, once we isolate this busy inode tracking from the VFS inode
RCU requirements, we can bound the allocation behaviour because
chunk allocation and log forces provide us with a guarantee that the
newly allocated inode chunks contain inodes that can be immediately
reallocated without having to care about where the new inode chunk
is located....

It might work, but I'm not a fan of how many hoops we are considering
jumping through to avoid getting tangled up in the RCU requirements
for VFS inode life cycles. I'd much prefer just being able to say
"all inodes busy, log force, try again" like we do with busy extent
limited block allocation...

That said, the complexity gets moved elsewhere (the VFS inode
lifecycle management) rather than into the inode allocator, but I
think that's a valid trade-off because the RCU requirements for
inode reallocation come from the VFS inode lifecycle constraints.

The "don't have a perf impact" side of thigns is generally why I
test all my new code with fsmark and other scalability tests before
I go anywhere near fstests. If it doesn't perform, it's not worth
trying to make work correctly...

Cheers,

Dave.
