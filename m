Yeah, capture seems appropriate, maybe relink -> continue? i.e.
capture the remaining defer_ops to be run, then continue running
them?

/me shrugs and thinks "naming is hard"....

Exactly what problem is this hack supposed to avoid? having the
filesystem ENOSPC before all the deferops have been completed?

if so, can that even happen? Because the fact that the intents are
in the log means that when they were started there was enough space
in the fs for them to run, so ENOSPC should not be an issue, right?

I'm not sure ENOSPC is really a problem for recovery of deferred ops
given the above...
