This _scratch_xfs_db() call and the same one a bit earlier both seem
spurious. Otherwise this test LGTM.

Can we have one test per patch in the future please?

I'm not sure how time factor is typically used, but perhaps we should
sanity check that nr_incr > 0.

Also, could we randomize the increment value a bit to add some variance
to the test? That could be done here or we could turn this into a min
increment value or something based on time factor and randomize the
increment in the loop, which might be a little more effective of a test.

What is this for?

If I understand this correctly, this will fill up the fs and populate
some kind of background cache with a metadump to facilitate restoring
the state on repeated calls. I see this speeds things up a bit from the
initial run, but I'm also wondering if we really need to reset this
state on every iteration. Would we expect much difference in behavior if
we populated once at the start of the test and then just bumped up the
write count until we get to the max or the repair completes?

FWIW, a quick hack to test that out reduces my (cache cold, cache hot)
run times of this test from something like (~4m, ~1m) to (~3m, ~12s).
That's probably not quite quick group territory, but still a decent
time savings.

Didn't the previous test verify that the filesystem doesn't mount if
NEEDSREPAIR?

Same here. It probably makes sense to test that NEEDSREPAIR remains set
throughout the test sequence until repair completes cleanly, but I'm not
sure we need to repeat the mount cycle every go around.
