Hi all,

bcachefs has a nodataio mount option that is used for isolated metadata
performance testing purposes. When enabled, it performs all metadata I/O
as normal and shortcuts data I/O by directly invoking bio completion.
Kent had asked for something similar for fs comparison purposes some
time ago and I put together a quick hack based around an iomap flag and
mount option for XFS.

I don't recall if I ever posted the initial version and Kent recently
asked about whether we'd want to consider merging something like this. I
think there are at least a couple things that probably need addressing
before that is a viable option.

One is that the mount option is kind of hacky in and of itself. Beyond
that, this mechanism provides a means for stale data exposure because
writes with nodataio mode enabled will operate as if writes were
completed normally (including unwritten extent conversion). Therefore, a
remount to !nodataio mode means we read off whatever was last written to
storage.

Kent mentioned that Eric (or somebody?) had floated the idea of a mkfs
time feature flag or some such to control nodataio mode. That would
avoid mount api changes in general and also disallow use of such
filesystems in a non-nodataio mode, so to me seems like the direction
bcachefs should go with its variant of this regardless.

Personally, I don't have much of an opinion on whether something like
this lands upstream or just remains as a local test hack for isolated
performance testing. The code is simple enough as it is and not really
worth the additional polishing for the latter, but I offered to at least
rebase and post for discussion. Thoughts, reviews, flames appreciated.

Brian
