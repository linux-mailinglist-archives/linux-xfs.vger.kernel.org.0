I checked the code, and it turns out that the only reason for
specifying sunit/swidth during mkfs is to mark the superblock as
"supporting data alignment". The real sunit/swidth is always
determined during mount, based on the underlying storage. The
significant property of the storage is the deduplication granularity;
we saw that we get best deduplication results when XFS sunit/swidth
are aligned to deduplication granularity. During storage migrations,
an XFS share can be migrated to a storage with different deduplication
parameters; hence we need to be able to update the runtime
sunit/swidth.

Thanks,
Alex.
