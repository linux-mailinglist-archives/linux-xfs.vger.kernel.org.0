It looks like perhaps the assignment of sb->s_fs_info was lost as well?
Skipping to the end, I see xfs_init_fs_context() alloc mp and assign
fc->s_fs_info. xfs_get_tree() leads to xfs_fill_super(), which somehow
gets mp from sb->s_fs_info (not fc->...), but then resets sb->s_fs_info
on error and frees the names, leaving fs->s_fs_info so presumably
xfs_fc_free() can free mp along with a couple of the names (again). I
can't really make heads or tails of what this is even attempting to do.

That aside, it's not clear to me why the new code can't follow a similar
pattern as the old code with regard to allocation. Allocate mp in
xfs_fill_super() and set up sb/fc pointers, reset pointers and free mp
on error return. Otherwise, xfs_fc_free() checks for fc->s_fs_info !=
NULL and frees mp from there. Is there some reason we can't continue to
do that?
