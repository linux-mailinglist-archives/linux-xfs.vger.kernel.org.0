Hi Darrick,

I should have mentioned this earlier, but for several years XFS developer 
Christoph Hellwig has been working on a feature inspired by the FAST 2015 
paper.  My HP colleagues and I met Christoph at FAST 2015 and he expressed 
interest in doing something similar in XFS.  Since then he has reported 
doing a considerable amount of work toward that goal, though I don't know 
the current state of his efforts.

I'm just pointing out a possible connection between the "atomic file 
commits" described below and Christoph's work; I don't know if the 
implementations are similar, but to an outsider it sounds like they aspire 
to serve the same purpose:  Enabling applications to efficiently evolve 
files from one well-defined state to another atomically even in the 
presence of failure.

Regardless of how and by whom this goal is achieved, folks like Suyash and 
I eagerly await the results.

May the Force be with you!

-- Terence
