ISTM that anything posted that isn't intended to go through the typical
review -> merge cycle should simply be tagged RFC. That includes things
with obvious implementation gaps, prototypes looking for design
discussion, patchbomb backups, etc. The details can always be described
in the cover letter, but RFC helps reviewers prioritize based on that
information and immediately indicates to the maintainer that this isn't
on the merge track.

That's a bit different than an explicit release target, which I
personally find a bit dubious given that I think it could discourage
wider review on patches. IOW, I'd be a little concerned that patches
would start being merged ASAP after meeting some minimum criteria for
the current release (i.e. 24 hours + a review, noted above) as opposed
to more common sense behavior where more reviews might be ideal (and/or
likely based on time on list) based on the complexity of a particular
feature, etc. Just my .02, though.

Do note that I personally rarely ever know or care at what point in a
release we're at when posting patches to the list. I post patches when
ready for review, acknowledge that merge is dependent on review and
expect further review feedback can come at any time (not immediately)
and lead to any number of releases for a particular series. Therefore, I
ultimately care more about getting something merged into the pipeline
such that release is imminent vs. whether it lands in this release or
the next. IMO, the purpose of the rolling release cycle is to separate
the development process from the release process as such. That aside, my
main point here is to indicate that if I do happen to post something
"last minute" as such, I most likely have no idea, have no expectation
beyond hitting the next "reasonable deadline" and thus do not intend to
put implicit pressure on the maintainer. :)
