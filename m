Since you've formatted with rmapbt enabled, you probably have a new
enough xfsprogs that you can /also/ use this on a live fs:

$ xfs_spaceman -c 'freesp -g'  /
        AG    extents     blocks
         0       2225    1426437
         1       2201    1716114

         3       2307    1567751

And if you really want the per-AG histogram...

$ xfs_spaceman -c 'freesp -s -a 2'  /
   from      to extents  blocks    pct
