Ok, if that's the case, we still need to be able to allocate MAXEXTLEN in
a single transaction. That's 2^21 filesystem blocks, which at most
is 2^21 rtexts.

Hence I think we probably should have a separate rt-write
reservation that handles this case, and we use that for allocation
on rt devices rather than the bt-based allocation reservation.

I can see how this works, but it strikes me as a bit of a hack. We
calculate the worst case reservations up front to avoid having to
play games like this in the code. Hence I think the correct thing to
do is fix the reservation to ensure we can do MAXEXTLEN allocations
without overruns...

Cheers,

Dave.
