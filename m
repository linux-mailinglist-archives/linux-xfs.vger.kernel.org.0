That's just a happy accident and not intentional in any way. Just
fixing the case that occurs while holding the sb buffer lock doesn't
actually fix the underlying problem, it just uses this as a bandaid.

I said on IRC that this is what xfs_trans_unreserve_and_mod_sb() is
for. For !lazysbcount filesystems the transaction will be marked
dirty (i.e XFS_TRANS_SB_DIRTY is set) and so we'll always run the
slow path that takes the m_sb_lock and updates mp->m_sb. 

It's faster for me to explain this by patch than any other way. See
below.

Cheers,

Dave.

xfs: update superblock counters correctly for !lazysbcount

From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

Keep the mount superblock counters up to date for !lazysbcount
filesystems so that when we log the superblock they do not need
updating in any way because they are already correct.
