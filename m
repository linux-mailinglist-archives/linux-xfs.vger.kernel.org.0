<nod> Dave looked at an earlier version and wanted the comments for
xfs_da_format.h to steer people at the entsize helpers.  I more or less
agree that it's overkill everywhere else though.

So I looked at the libattr headers for Ubuntu 22.04 and saw this:

/*
 * List the names and sizes of the values of all the attributes of an object.
 * "Cursor" must be allocated and zeroed before the first call, it is used
 * to maintain context between system calls if all the attribute names won't
 * fit into the buffer on the first system call.
 * The return value is -1 on error (w/errno set appropriately), 0 on success.
 */
extern int attr_list(const char *__path, char *__buffer, const int __buffersize,
		int __flags, attrlist_cursor_t *__cursor)
	__attribute__ ((deprecated ("Use listxattr or llistxattr instead")));
extern int attr_listf(int __fd, char *__buffer, const int __buffersize,
		int __flags, attrlist_cursor_t *__cursor)
	__attribute__ ((deprecated ("Use flistxattr instead")));

I take that as a sign that they could drop all these xfs-specific APIs
one day, which means we ought to keep them in xfs_fs.h.
