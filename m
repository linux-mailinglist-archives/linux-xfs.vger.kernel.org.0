<nod> Sounds like a reasonable approach for a pretty odd duck.

Oh, I didn't mean dropping ->iop_release completely, I just wondered
about removing the conditional, e.g.

	if (->iop_release)
		->iop_release(...);

becomes:

	->iop_release(...);

Now that every log item type (I think?) actually has a release method.
