Oh.  Yeah.  mkfs is from the xfsprogs for-next branch, with 6.6 kernel
libxfs stuff backported, as well as the defaults changed to turn on
rmapbt by default.  Sorry about that omission.

Probably not.  FWIW the simulated pmem is a ~9.8GB tmpfs file that's
passed through to qemu via the libvirt xml stuff that sets up pmem.
If your pmem is larger (or real pmem!) then you likely get a bigger log
and hence lower chance of that message.

Nope.  Last night's run was clean.

Hmm.  I'm theorizing that generic/269 was merely tripping over some
pmem page that has corrupted state.

$ make vmlinux W=123e

You probably don't want the 'e' part since that'll fail the build on
any warning.  The actual warnings turned on by levels 1-3 vary depending
on the compiler (gcc 12.3.0 here).
