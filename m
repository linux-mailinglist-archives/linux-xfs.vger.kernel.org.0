Yup, I didn't compile test my suggestion - i just quickly wrote it
down to demonstrate what I was thinking. I expect that you have
understood that using for_each_perag() was what I was suggesting is
used, not that the sample code I wrote is exactly correct. IOWs,

		for_each_perag(args->mp, start_agno, args->pag)

would have worked, even though the code does not do what it looks
like it should from the context of start_agno. Which means this
would be better:

		start_agno = 0;
		for_each_perag_from(args->mp, start_agno, args->pag)

because it directly documents the value we are iterating from.

That is not correct, either. agno needs to be a variable - it is
the loop agno counter that tracks the iteration.

Cheers,

Dave.
