It might be already solved, depending on if Dave's rule of thumb
was determined before the Linux spinlocks switched to MCS locks or not.

In my experience spinlock scalability depends a lot on how long the
critical section is (that is very important, short sections are a lot
worse than long sections), as well as if the contention is inside a
socket or over sockets, and the actual hardware behaves differently too.

So I would be quite surprised if the "rule of 4" generally holds.
