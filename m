You're right, that's the only reliable thing.

Not expecting that.

That would be great, but don't expect it'd happen.

That's what happen on openSUSE.

FYI DEV_MIN_SIZE is used just for tests which test LTP API itself. For real
tests is DEV_SIZE_MB (lib/tst_device.c). And actually 300 MB is enough,
therefore the only change for the default values is: DEV_SIZE_MB from 256 to 300
(should be enough for all LTP tests: C and shell API, also these tests of LTP
API itself).  I also think 46MB is not worth of hacks.

BTW for some reason DEV_MIN_SIZE was higher than the default (probably to test
library with non-default value, but now is the same, we might want to increase
it (or remove it).

Indeed, this value can stay. This check is here because although LTP uses loop
device by default, any device can be used via LTP_DEV env variable.

For use with LTP_DEV.

Anyway, Darrick, Amir, thank you both for your input.

Kind regards,
