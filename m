That reads much nicer than the original, thanks. I'm still not sure what
that "major differences in the way each type of structure integrate the
dabtree index within the information being stored" phrasing is supposed
to express beyond saying something like "major differences in the way
each type of structure use the dabtree," but I'm not going to harp on
that...
