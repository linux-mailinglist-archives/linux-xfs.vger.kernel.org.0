It's not so much the shutdown check that I find random as much as how it
intends to handle pinned inodes.

The fact that shutdown is racy is just background context. My point is
that this patch appears to introduce special shutdown handling for a
condition where it 1.) didn't previously exist and 2.) doesn't appear to
be necessary.

The current push/flush code only incorporates a shutdown check
indirectly via mapping the buffer, which simulates an I/O failure and
causes us to abort the flush (and shutdown if the I/O failure happened
for some other reason). If the shutdown happened sometime after we
acquired the buffer, then there's no real impact on this code path. We
flush the inode(s) and return success. The shutdown will be handled
appropriately when xfsaild attempts to submit the buffer.

The new code no longer maps the buffer because that is done much
earlier, but for some reason incorporates a new check to abort the flush
if the fs is already shutdown. The problem I have with this is that
these checks tend to be brittle, untested and a maintenance burden. As
such, I don't think we should ever add new shutdown checks for cases
that aren't required for functional correctness. That way we hopefully
move to a state where we have the minimum number of shutdown checks with
broadest coverage to ensure everything unwinds correctly, but don't have
to constantly battle with insufficiently tested logic in obscure
contexts that silently break as surrounding code changes over time and
leads to random fstests hangs and shutdown logic cleanouts every couple
of years.

So my question for any newly added shutdown check is: what problem does
this check solve? If there isn't an explicit functional problem and it's
intended more as convenience/efficiency logic (which is what the comment
implies), then I don't think it's justified. If there is one, then
perhaps it is justified, but should be more clearly documented (and I do
still think the pin check logic should be cleaned up, but that's a very
minor tweak).
