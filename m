Ah, I see.. thanks. I was thinking there was some kind of lock imbalance
warning or something, but in reality I think something like the
following is sufficient:

"Update lockdep's ownership information to reflect transfer of the ilock
from the current task to the worker. Otherwise assertions that the lock
is held (such as when logging the inode) might fail due to incorrect
task owner state."
