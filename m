Let's deal with further cleanups after this patchset and the
follow-on patchsets that I have are sorted out. All cleanups will do
right now is invalidate all the stuff I'm still working on that sits
on top of this patchset..

I originally tried this, but then I ended up with places in
follow-on patchsets where I had to do this sort of check:

	if (bp->b_write_done == xfs_iflush_done)

To detect a buffer that already had inodes attached to it. Which
clearly told me that there should be a state flag to indicate that
the buffer has attached inodes....

Cheers,

Dave.
