It's a bugfix ahead of new behaviors introduced in patch 2.  I clearly
didn't explain this well enough, so I'll try again.

Before abrt/systemd-coredump, FS_IOC_SHUTDOWN fsstress tests would do
something like the following:

1. start fsstress, which chdirs to $TEST_DIR
2. shut down the filesystem
3. fsstress tries to stat($TEST_DIR), fails, and calls abort
4. abort triggers coredump
5. kernel fails to write "core" to $TEST_DIR (because fs is shut down)
6. test finishes, no core files written to $here, test passes

Once you install systemd-coredump, that changes to:

same 1-4 above
5. kernel pipes core file to coredumpctl, which writes it to /var/crash
6. test finishes, no core files written to $here, test passes

And then with patch 2 of this series, that becomes:

same 1-4 above
5. kernel pipes core file to coredumpctl, which writes it to /var/crash
6. test finishes, ./check queries coredumpctl for any new coredumps,
   and copies them to $here
7. ./check finds core files written to $here, test fails

Now we've caused a test failure where there was none before, simply
because the crash reporting improved.

Therefore this patch changes fsstress not to call abort() from check_cwd
when it has a reasonable suspicion that the fs has died.

(Did that help?  /me is still pre-coffee...)

No no, "really silly" refers to failing tests that we didn't used to
fail.

I think we ought to add a new ioctl or something so that callers can
positively identify a shut down filesystem.  bfoster I think was asking
about that for fstests some years back, and ended up coding a bunch of
grep heuristics to work around the lack of a real call.

I think we can't drop the "stat{,x} returns EIO on shutdown fs" behavior
because I know of a few, uh, users whose heartbeat monitor periodically
queries statx($PWD) and reboots the node if it returns errno.
