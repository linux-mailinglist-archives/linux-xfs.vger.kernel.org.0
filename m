This seems really confused.

Up until this point in the patch set you are pulling code out
of xfs_buf_alloc_pages() into helpers. Now you are getting rid of
the helpers and putting the slightly modified code back into
xfs_buf_alloc_pages(). This doesn't make any sense at all.

The freeing helper now requires the buffer state to be
manipulated on allocation failure so that the free function doesn't
run off the end of the bp->b_pages array. That's a bit of a
landmine, and it doesn't really clean anything up much at all.

And on the allocation side there is new "fail fast" behaviour
because you've lifted the readahead out of xfs_buf_alloc_pages. You
also lifted the zeroing checks, which I note that you immediately
put back inside xfs_buf_alloc_pages() in the next patch.

The stuff up to this point in the series makes sense. From this
patch onwards it seems to me that you're just undoing the factoring
and cleanups from the first few patches...

I mean, like the factoring of xfs_buf_alloc_slab(), you could have
just factored out xfs_buf_alloc_pages(bp, page_count) from
xfs_buf_allocate_memory() and used that directly in
xfs_buf_get_uncached() and avoided a bunch of this factoring, make a
slight logic modification and recombine churn. And it would be
trivial to do on top of the bulk allocation patch which already
converts both of these functions to use bulk allocation....

Cheers,

Dave.
