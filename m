From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

This is fixing a g/476 AGF ABBA deadlock that occurs reliably
with this patchset so far. Allocation is attempted in AG 2, which
has no space, then AG 3 which fails with "nominleft" search error.
THis then returns to the caller with AGF 3 still locked, and the
caller then does a retry with more restricted allocation criteria.
This then starts again at AG 2, which then deadlocks because it's
the wrong AGF locking order.

What I can't work out is how the existing TOT code isn't hitting
this every time g/476 is run. I can't see where it unlocks AGF 3,
nor can I see how it avoids the out of order locking on nospace
retries. So this looks like a pre-existing bug, but it takes this
allocator rework to expose it?

More work investigation needed here.
