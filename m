$ grep XFS_RT /boot/config-6.15.8-200.fc42.x86_64
CONFIG_XFS_RT=y

Fedora do Enable XFS_RT :-)

I don't think this is a solution. Offloading distributions
responsibility to the upstream projects is almost never a good idea.
While you fix a problem for one distro, you cause a problem in another.

I consider removing the freedom of distributions to choose what they
want/not want to enable painful. With this patch, any distribution that
wants to not enable XFS_RT with zoned devices will need to custom patch
their kernels, and this create a lot of technical debt, specially for
non-mainstream distributions which don't have enough people working on
them.

Maintaining a kernel config file is way less complicated than keeping a
stack of custom patches, and ensuring the same patches will be available
on the next releases.

Yes, might not be the best scenario to go and convince your distro of
choice to enable this or that kernel option, but then offloading this to
kernel maintainers just because your distro doesn't do it is not the
right thing to do.

I'm always fine changing my mind (even if I need to knock my head on
the desk a few times before). But unless we have a good reason to remove
distributions the possibility to have zoned devices enabled without
XFS_RT, in lieu of distributions that don't want to bother maintaining
their configuration files, this is a hard no from me.

And I don't consider "changing the config file of a distribution is
painful" as a good reason.
