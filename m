Nope. But the attr btree is a different beast to the dirv2
structure - it's a hashed index btree with the xattr records in the
leaf, it's not an index of a fixed max size external data structure.

Yes. ALso remote xattr blocks, which aren't stored in the dabtree
at all, but are indexed by the attr fork BMBT address space.

So I think for XFS_DA_NODE_MAXDEPTH = 5, the xattr tree with a 4kB
block size (minimum allowed, IIRC), we can index approximately
(500^4) individual xattrs in the btree index (assuming 4 levels of
index and 1 level of leaf nodes containing xattrs).

My math calculates that to be about 62.5 billion xattrs before we
run out of index space in a 5 level tree with a 4kB block size.
Hence I suspect we'll run out of attr fork extents even on a 32 bit
extent count before we run out of xattr index space.

Also, 62.5 billion xattrs is more links than we can have to a single
inode (4billion), so we're not going to exhaust the xattr index
space just with parent pointers...

*nod*

ISTR that Chandan had already done some of this when he
characterised the attr fork btree behaviour w.r.t. suitabililty for
large numbers of parent pointers before starting this extent count
work.

Yup, that sounds like a good plan.

Cheers,
