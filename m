Yeah, that's also unclear, since one could argue that after failed
writeback, userspace might actually *want* the kernel to splice the
pagecache for the busted file into a new file on another filesystem.

That's a very good point you've raised -- userspace can't associate an
EIO return value with either of the fds in use.  It can't even tell if
the filesystem itself hit some metadata error somewhere else (e.g.
refcount data), and that's the real reason why EIO got thrown back to
userspace.

On those grounds, I think FICLONE/FIEDEDUPE need to preserve the
AS_EIO/AS_ENOSPC state in the address_space so that actual fsync (or
syncfs, or any of the known 'persist me now' calls) can also return the
status.

I'll try to push that for 6.3.
