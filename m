None of those things. If there's a problem with a branch, you drop
the entire branch and ask the submitter to reformulate the branch
with a new tag and send a new pull request.

So I think the problem here is that you did, in fact, rewrite these
commits. e.g the commit I have in front of me:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/xfs/xfs-linux.git/commit/?h=for-next&id=25f25648e57c793b4b18b010eac18a4e2f2b3050

Shows that it was committed at:

author		Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>	2021-06-18 08:21:48 -0700
committer	Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>	2021-06-18 08:24:23 -0700

But in my original branch used for the pull request:

author		Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>	2021-06-03 14:57:24 +1000
committer	Dave Chinner <david@fromorbit.com>	2021-06-03 14:57:24 +1000

And that is what the script is complaining about.

AFAICT, based on the lack of a merge commit in the tree, is that you
rebased the commits out of the branch I originally asked you to pull
from. That resulted in them being rewritten in order into your tree
which meant you are now the committer, not me.

IOWs, if you do anything other than a direct merge of a signed tag,
you need to add your own SOB because you are creating new commits
rather than merging stable commit history from another branch.

I was going to ask you to revert the entire merge and then *maybe*
asking you to pull a smaller, tested branch with none of the
problems in it. That would have given you a clean merge and wouldn't
have lost the signed tag or the description text in the tag, but...

Hindsight says "talk about the plan first as it will save everyone a
lot of unnecessary work".

Cheers,

Dave.
