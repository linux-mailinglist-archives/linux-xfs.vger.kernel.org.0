Ok, so this is all just a long way of saying:

Revert commit 51e6104fdb95 ("xfs: detect empty attr leaf blocks in
xfs_attr3_leaf_verify") because it was wrong.

Yes?

I still think it should be in the commit history, not here in the
code. The reason I missed this is that the existing comment about
empty leaf attrs is above a section that is verifying entries
*after* various fields in the header had been validated. Hence I
thought it was a case that the header field had not been validated
and so I added it. Simple mistake.

This needs to be a comment at the head of the function, not
associated with validity checking the entries. i.e.

/*
 * Validate the attribute leaf.
 *
 * A leaf block can be empty as a result of transient state whilst
 * creating a new leaf form attribute:
 *
 * 1. setxattr adds a new extended attribute to a file;
 * 2. The file has zero existing attributes;
 * 3. The attribute is too large to fit in the attribute fork;
 * 4. The attribute is small enough to fit in a leaf block;
 * 5. A log flush occurs after committing the transaction that creates
 *    the (empty) leaf block; and
 * 6. The filesystem goes down after the log flush but before the new
 *    attribute can be committed to the leaf block.
 *
 * Hence we need to ensure that we don't fail the validation purely
 * because the leaf is empty.
 */

Cheers,

Dave.
