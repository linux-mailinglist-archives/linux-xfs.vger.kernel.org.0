How does that happen?

If we are freeing extents (i.e XFS_ALLOC_FLAG_FREEING is set) and
we are doing allocation for AGFL and we only found busy extents,
then it's OK to fail the allocation.

We have options here - once we get to the end of the btree and
haven't found a candidate that isn't busy, we could fail
immediately. Or maybe we try an optimisitic flush which forces the
log and waits for as short while (instead of forever) for the
generation to change and then fail if we get a timeout response. Or
maybe there's a more elegant way of doing this that hasn't yet
rattled out of my poor, overloaded brain right now.

Just because we currently do a blocking flush doesn't mean we always
must do a blocking flush....

Cheers,

Dave.
