I dont' think that can happen. A directory is limited in size to 3
segments of 32GB each. In reality, only the data segment can ever
reach 32GB as both the dabtree and free space segments are just
compact indexes of the contents of the 32GB data segment.

Hence a directory is never likely to reach more than about 40GB of
blocks which is nowhere near large enough to overflowing a 32 bit
extent count field.

Cheers,

Dave.
