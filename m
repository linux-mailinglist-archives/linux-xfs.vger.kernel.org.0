Indeed, this does seem like an odd failure. The shutdown on transaction
cancel implies cancellation of a dirty transaction. This is not
necessarily corruption as much as just being the generic
naming/messaging related to shutdowns due to unexpected in-core state.
The patch in question removes some modifications to in-core busy extent
state during extent allocation that are fundamentally unsafe in
combination with how allocation works. This change doesn't appear to
affect any transaction directly, so the correlation may be indirect.

xfs/076 looks like it's a sparse inode allocation test, which certainly
seems relevant in that it is stressing the ability to allocate inode
chunks under free space fragmentation. If this patch further restricts
extent allocation by removing availability of some set of (recently
freed, busy) extents, then perhaps there is some allocation failure
sequence that was previously unlikely enough to mask some poor error
handling logic or transaction handling (like an agfl fixup dirtying a
transaction followed by an allocation failure, for example) that we're
now running into.

Not off the top of my head. Something along the lines of the above seems
plausible, but that's just speculation at this point.

I think it would be good to understand whether there's a regression
introduced by this patch, a bug somewhere else or just some impedence
mismatch in logic between the combination of this change and whatever
else happens to be in v5.10.y. Unfortunately I'm not able to reproduce
if I pull just this commit back into latest 5.10.y (5.10.118). I've
tried with a traditional bdev as well as a preallocated and sparse
loopback scratch dev. Have you tested this patch (backport) in isolation
in your reproducer env or only in combination with other pending
backports?
