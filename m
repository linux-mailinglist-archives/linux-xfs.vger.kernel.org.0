You snipped the part of my mail where I explained how we could handle
that without the uptodate array ;-(  Essentially, we do as you thought
it worked, we read the entire page (or at least the portion of it that
isn't going to be overwritten.  Once all the bytes have been transferred,
we can mark the page Uptodate.  We'll need to wait for the transfer to
happen if the write overlaps a block boundary, but we do that right now.

That benchmark started by zeroing the entire page cache, so all blocks
were marked Uptodate, so we wouldn't skip them on writeout.
