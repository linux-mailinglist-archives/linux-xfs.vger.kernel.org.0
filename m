I just did an analysis of this:

  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250613104240.509ff13c@batman.local.home/T/#md81abade0df19ba9062fd51ced4458161f885ac3

A TRACE_EVENT() is about 5K, and each DEFINE_EVENT() is about 1K.

That's exactly what I'm doing. In the thread I did the analysis, it has
code that triggers a warning for unused events. I'm currently cleaning
them up (and asking others to do it too), so that I can add that code
without triggering all the current unused tracepoints.

Feel free to take those patches and it will warn at build time. Note,
it currently only works for built in code, so you have to build your
module as a built in and not a module.

Ah you did notice ;-)
