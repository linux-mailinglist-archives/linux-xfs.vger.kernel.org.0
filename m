oops...right, we want to let the verifiers catch the errors here.

Speaking of which, I've been staring at the scripts but it's not clear
to me how the repair=none fuzz tests are expected to function. Many of
those tests corrupt AG metadata headers (e.g. the AGI lsn), which means
mount bails out with an error. But the golden output doesn't account for
that, so those tests will fail (e.g. xfs/456).

Further, for things like inode metadata fuzzing where the fs is usually
mountable, the tests will always succeed irrespective of the verifiers
firing or not (e.g. xfs/465).

I'd assume all those repair=none tests would need to check dmesg for
metadata corruptions, so something like:

--- a/common/fuzzy
+++ b/common/fuzzy
@@ -254,3 +254,3 @@ __scratch_xfs_fuzz_field_test() {
 		__scratch_xfs_fuzz_unmount
-	else

@@ -43,2 +43,5 @@ echo "Done fuzzing AGI"

If this makes sense, I'll send a separate patch to address it, and fix
all repair=none tests as above.

Will do that and send a v2, thanks for the review!
