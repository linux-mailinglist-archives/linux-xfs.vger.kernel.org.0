Using the weaker rules of LKMM (as relevant to Power) I could in fact
make it happen, the 'problem' is that it's being observed on the much
stronger x86_64.

So possibly I did overlook a more 'sensible' scenario, but I'm pretty
confident the problem holds as it fully explains the failure mode.

Just a wee bit.. I did need pen and paper and a fair amount of
scribbling for this one.

All in the name of making it go fast, I suppose. It used to be much
simpler... like much of the kernel.

The biggest problem I had with this thing was that the reproduction case
we had (Paul's rcutorture) wouldn't readily trigger on my machines
(altough it did, but at a much lower rate, just twice in a week's worth
of runtime).

Also; I'm sure you can spot a problem in the I/O layer much faster than
I possibly could :-)

Anyway, let me know if you still observe any problems.
