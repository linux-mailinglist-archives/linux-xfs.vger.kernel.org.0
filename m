Thanks, I'll have a look in a minute. I'm pretty sure I know what it
will show - I got a trace from Chandan earlier this afternoon and
the problem is log recovery doesn't yeild the cpu until it runs out
of transaction reservation space, so the push work doesn't run
because workqueue default behaviour is strict "run work only on the
CPU it is queued on"....

I've got an additional patch in testing right now...

Cheers,

Dave.
