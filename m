It's the same problem as last time -- I run upstream xfsprogs (with the
patch turning on rmap by default); and when this test runs apparently
there are logbufs options that increase the kernel's view of the minimum
log size to the point that we fail the mount time log size checks.

I observed that changing the LOOP_IMG creation code to make a 32G sparse
file results in an fs with a larger log area:

	$XFS_IO_PROG -f -c "truncate 32g" $LOOP_IMG

fixes all of these problems.  See diff below.

Eh, now that I've taken a second look at this, I don't think there's a
good way to filter this particular ASSERT vs. any other that could pop
up.
