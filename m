Hi all,

A long-time goal of mine is to get rid of xfs_check from fstests,
because it is deprecated, adds quite a bit of runtime to the test suite,
and consumes memory like crazy.  We've not been able to do that for lack
of even a basic field-by-field corruption detection comparison between
check and repair, so I temporarily modified the dangerous_repair tests
to warn when check finds something but repair says clean.

The patches below teach xfs_repair to complain about things that it
previously did not catch but xfs_check did.  The one remaining gap is
the lack of quota counter checking, which will be sent in a separate
series once I've worked out all the bugs.

If you're going to start using this mess, you probably ought to just
pull from my git trees, which are linked below.

This is an extraordinary way to destroy everything.  Enjoy!
Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
