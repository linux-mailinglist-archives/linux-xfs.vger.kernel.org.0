Dave and I had a short discussion about whether or not xattr trees
needed to have the same free space tracking that directories have, and
a comparison of how each of the two metadata types interact with
dabtrees resulted.  I've reworked this a bit to make it flow better as a
book chapter, so here we go.

+== Key Differences Between Directories and Extended Attributes
+
+Though directories and extended attributes can take advantage of the same
+variable length record btree structures (i.e. the dabtree) to map name hashes
+to disk blocks, there are major differences in the ways that each of those
+users embed the btree within the information that they are storing.
+
+Directory blocks require external free space tracking because the directory
+blocks are not part of the dabtree itself.  The dabtree leaves for a directory
+map name hashes to external directory data blocks.  Extended attributes, on
+the other hand, store all of the attributes in the leaves of the dabtree.
+
+When we add or remove an extended attribute in the dabtree, we split or merge
+leaves of the tree based on where the name hash index tells us a leaf needs to
+be inserted into or removed.  In other words, we make space available or
+collapse sparse leaves of the dabtree as a side effect of inserting or
+removing attributes.
+
+The directory structure is very different.  Directory entries cannot change
+location because each entry's logical offset into the directory data segment
+is used as the readdir/seekdir/telldir cookie, and the cookie is required to
+be stable for the life of the entry.  Therefore, we cannot store directory
+entries in the leaves of a dabtree (which is indexed in hash order) because
+the offset into the tree would change as other entries are inserted and
+removed.  Hence when we remove directory entries, we must leave holes in the
+data segment so the rest of the entries do not move.
+
+The directory name hash index (the dabtree bit) is held in the second
+directory segment.  Because the dabtree only stores pointers to directory
+entries in the (first) data segment, there is no need to leave holes in the
+dabtree itself.  The dabtree merges or splits leaves as required as pointers
+to the directory data segment are added or removed.  The dabtree itself needs
+no free space tracking.
+
+When we go to add a directory entry, we need to find the best-fitting free
+space in the directory data segment to turn into the new entry.  This requires
+a free space index for the directory data segment.  The free space index is
+held in the third directory segment.  Once we've used the free space index to
+find the block with that best free space, we modify the directory data block
+and update the dabtree to point the name hash at the new entry.
+
+In other words, the requirement for a free space map in the directory
+structure results from storing the directory entry data externally to the
+dabtree.  Extended atttributes are stored directly in the leaves of the
+dabtree (except for remote attributes which can be anywhere in the attr fork
+address space) and do not need external free space tracking to determine where
+to best insert them.  As a result, extended attributes exhibit nearly perfect
+scaling until we run out of memory.
