Hi folks,

The scrub-strengthen-rmap-checking branch of my xfs-linux repository at:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/djwong/xfs-linux.git

has just been updated for your review.

This code snapshot has been rebased against recent upstream, freshly
QA'd, and is ready for people to examine.  For veteran readers, the new
snapshot can be diffed against the previous snapshot; and for new
readers, this is a reasonable place to begin reading.  For the best
experience, it is recommended to pull this branch and walk the commits
instead of trying to read any patch deluge.

Here's the rebase against 6.3-rc5 of the online fsck design
documentation and all pending scrub fixes.  I've fixed most of the
low-hanging fruit that Dave commented on in #xfs.

(This isn't a true deluge, since I'm only posting this notice, not the
entire patchset.)

--D

The new head of the scrub-strengthen-rmap-checking branch is commit:

64e6494e1175 xfs: cross-reference rmap records with refcount btrees
