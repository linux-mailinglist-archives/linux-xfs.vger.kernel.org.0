On XFS, the timestamp update will either succeed or cause the
filesystem to shutdown as a failure with a dirty transaction is a
fatal, unrecoverable error.

If the filesystem has shut down, it doesn't matter that the data got
copied into the kernel - it's never going to make it to disk and
attempts to read it back will also fail. There's nothing that can be
exploited by such a failure on XFS - it's game over for everyone
once the fs has shut down....

Why not also bump ctime at write completion if a query races with
the write()? Wouldn't that put ns-granularity ctime based change
detection on a par with i_version?

Userspace isn't going to notice the difference - the ctime they
observe indicates that it was changed during the syscall. So
who/what is going to care if we bump ctime twice in the syscall
instead of just once in this rare corner case?

Cheers,

Dave.
