Hmm.  The last person to touch the ATTR_MODE part of setattr_copy was
you, back in January 2021:

2f221d6f7b88 ("attr: handle idmapped mounts")

though I think that was merely switching the user_ns parameter to
inode_capable_wrt_uidgid.  The previous major change was made by Andy
Lutomirski in 2014:

23adbe12ef7d ("fs,userns: Change inode_capable to capable_wrt_inode_uidgid")

This seems to be the start(?) of the "_wrt_inode_uidgid" variants,
though I think the only real change in behavior was checking that the
inode's gid is mapped in the current userns?  Going back even further,
it looks like Eric Biederman started thsi whole process in 2012 with:

7fa294c8991c ("userns: Allow chown and setgid preservation")

This patch switched the VFS from purely checking process capabilities to
checking the privileges of the userns, I think.  From a purely code
inspection perspective, this is where the behavior divergence between
XFS and VFS began.

I'm ok with switching the fixes tag to 7fa294, though I won't be shocked
if this patch doesn't apply cleanly to fs/xfs/ from that era.

Thanks for the review!

<rant>
That said, I now have this bad habit of picking more recent commits for
Fixes because I get so much blowback from the stable maintainers it's
not worth any of the frustration.

I *do* still agree with the principle that a fixpatch should reference
the exact moment things went wrong, even if some autobackport bot can't
trivially apply the patch!

I fully expect to get complaints from the LTS maintainers like I always
do when I attach a Fixes tag without throughly compile-testing every LTS
branch between the tag and HEAD.  They clearly haven't taken any of my
hints, so I'll just say it: I DON'T HAVE TIME TO QA ANYTHING OTHER THAN
UPSTREAM!  Six LTS kernels (plus 3 distro kernels) will eat a week and a
half of time on the testing cloud, **per fix**.

Hell, you all have probably noticed: I haven't had sufficient mental
spoons to do much of anything with upstream, so there is no 5.18 merge
branch and reviews are getting sloppier.
