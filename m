Wrong.  I'm well aware that userspace tolower and kernel tolower are
*NOT* the same thing.  I'm trying to **STOP USING** tolower in XFS.

I'm **replacing** tolower with a new function that substitutes specific
bytes with other bytes, and I'm redefining the ondisk format to say that
names remain arbitrary sequences of bytes that do not include nulls or
slashes but that hash indexing and lookups will apply the above byte
transformation.  The rules for that transformation may or may not
coincide with what anyone thinks is "upper case in ASCII", but that's
irrelevant.  The rules will be the same in all places, and they will not
break any existing filesystems.

Maybe I should've named it xfs_ItB8n_ci_o43jM28() to make it clearer
that I don't care what ascii is, nor does it matter here.  Perhaps I
should have written "Now that we've made kernel and userspace perform
the same mathematical transformation on dirent name byte arrays before
hashing, add that to the selftest code as well."

Christoph and Barry Naujok should have defined specifically the exact
transformation and the permitted ranges of name inputs when they wrote
the feature.  I wasn't around when this feature was invented...

...and I don't think they understood the complexities when the code was
written.

I disagree.  I'm saying that 5 ðŸ’© 8 = tiger because that's what the ðŸ’©
operator does.  ðŸ’© is not +, even if 4 ðŸ’© 8 = 12.

You claim to understand the complexities; how would /you/ fix this?
I'll send along the test cases that reproduce the problems.
