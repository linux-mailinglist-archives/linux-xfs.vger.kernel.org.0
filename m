Ok, so the fixes to xfs_log_calc_max_attrsetm_res() are what actually
fixed the test failure? If so, that strikes me as a good independent fix
candidate (re: refactoring) because the commit log for that one should
probably describe the observable problem and the fix separate from other
issues.

Ok, so most of the rest sounds like bogosity discovered by code
inspection. That's not that surprising given that transaction
reservations are worst case values and thus it seems we sometimes get
away with bogus calculations just so long as the reservations are large
enough. :)

As it is, the final result of this patchset looks nice to me, it's just
a matter of getting there more incrementally to facilitate reviewing the
changes being made. FWIW, if we do end up with a final "fix the broken
xattr res calculation" patch at the end of the series, I think it would
be helpful to have a very deliberate commit log that contains something
like the following:

'The xattr reservation currently consists of:

	- superblock
	- dabtree * maxdepth
	- ...

This calculation is bogus because it double accounts X as part of Y and
Z, doesn't account for AGF, etc. etc. ...

The xattr reservation needs to account the following:

	- superblock
	- agf
	- dabtree * maxdepth
	- rmtblocks
	- ...

... '

Ok. I think it's probably safer to preserve historical behavior in that
regard, unless somebody can confirm otherwise in the meantime.
