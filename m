Ah, ok.  You're pointing out that repair needs to set features_changed
right after printing "clearing needsrepair flag and regenerating
metadata", and that this patch sort of papers over the underlying issue.

The genesis of this patch wasn't xfs/158 failing, it was the secondary
sb fuzz testing noticing that xfs_scrub reported a failure whereas
xfs_repair didn't.

So, I'll go add an extra patch to fix the upgrade case, and I think we
can let Eric add this one to his tree.
