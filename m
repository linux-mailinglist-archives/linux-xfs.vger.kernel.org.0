Doubt it.

Sure, but my point was that checks against the max file offset
as a block count are applied to the startoff field, not the
startoff + blockcount value, so we can potentially get extents on
disk beyond the above definition of XFS_MAX_FILEOFF...

i.e. startoff can be < XFS_MAX_FILEOFF, but startoff + blockcount
can be > XFS_MAX_FILEOFF, and there's nothing in the code that
prevents that from occurring...

e.g. what's preventing speculative delalloc from going beyond
XFS_MAX_FILEOFF, even though the actual file offset that is being
written is within XFS_MAX_FILEOFF?

Cheers,

Dave.
