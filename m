It's possible to implement an online log resize. That doesn't mean
it is easy to do. Start thinking about all the failure modes and how
to reliably avoid and/or recover from such failures.

e.g. how do you do an atomic swap from the old log to the new log in
a way that if we crash in the middle of the operation then log
recovery on the next mount will result in either the original state
on the old journal (nothing has changed) or that full operation
completion occurs (running on a fully initialised new journal).

Doing it offline is simpler, but there's still a bunch of metadata
modifications that have to be done correctly. i.e. we still have to
handle the case that the system could crash half way through the
offline log move operation in a manner that doesn't trash the
filesystem or user data.

If you've got 6 months to a year to spend getting all this right,
then I don't think anyone if going to say not to being able to
resize logs and/or convert internal/external logs dynamically. It's
just a lot of work to make it robust and reliable....

Cheers,

Dave.
