I checked the xfsprogs/io/open.c, it truely doesn't "Close the current file",
(need to update the man-page?) and it looks like make all opened files as a
list, then operate them one by one(?):

  execve("/usr/sbin/xfs_io", ["xfs_io", "-c", "mmap 0 4k", "-c", "mwrite 0 4k", "-c", "open testfile", "-c", "fsync", "-c", "mwrite 0 4k", "testfile"], 0x7ffdc2285b78 /* 42 vars */) = 0
  ...
  openat(AT_FDCWD, "testfile", O_RDWR)    = 3
  ...
  mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC, MAP_SHARED, 3, 0) = 0x7efc04548000
  ...
  openat(AT_FDCWD, "testfile", O_RDWR)    = 4
  ...
  fsync(3)                                = 0
  fsync(4)                                = 0
  exit_group(0)                           = ?
  +++ exited with 0 +++

Anyway, looks like we're stuck at here. So I have 3 crude methods which is just
out of my mind, hope to get review:)

1) Skip this test for overlay directly, as this patch does.
2) Add a _require_real_scratch_shutdown() helper, require the $FSTYP supporting
   GOINGDOWN ioctl, don't fallback to the underlying fs. Then let generic/623
   use it to skip overlay and other fs which really doesn't support shutdown.
3) Change xfsprogs/io/shutdown.c, let shutdown_f() accept an extra mountpoint
   path argument, to shutdown a specified mountpoint (?? not sure if it's
   reasonable for xfs_io :). Then let generic/623 require and use this feature.

Thanks,
Zorro
