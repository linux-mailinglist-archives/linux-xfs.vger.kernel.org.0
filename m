It's the commit message that requires it to be a separate patch, not
the code. The commit message describes the architectural change that
the new grant head accounting is built on. While the code to
implement the accounting is simple, the reasons behind doing this
and how the new reservation accounting will work is anything but
simple.

IOWs, rather than try to explain all this in the already extremely
complex "use byte accounting for grant heads" changeover patch, I
separated this new accounting mechanism into it's own patch so it is
easier for people to understand how the log tail space is being
calculated and therefore determine if the mechanism is correct
without having to worry about it being hidden amongst all the other
changes that the grant head accounting require....

Cheers,

Dave.
