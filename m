I just tried with xfsprogs-6.14 and also upgraded the kernel from =
6.1.0-35 to 6.12.22+bpo. The new xfsprogs haven't been installed =
properly, just lying in its own directory to be run from there. I downed =
the system again and ran a new repair. After the initial repair, I ran =
it another time, and another, just to check. After rebooting back, it =
still throws thesame error at me about "[l=C3=B8. mai 3 03:28:14 2025] =

I couldn't find much relevnt output, really. I can obviously run it =
again, but it takes some time and if you have some magick options to try =
with it, please let me know first.

thanks
