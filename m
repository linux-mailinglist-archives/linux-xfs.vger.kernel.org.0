I prototyped that and discarded it - it made inode reclaim much,
much slower because it introduced delays (lock contention) adding
new inodes to the reclaim list while a reclaim isolation walk was in
progress.

The radix tree based mechanism we have right now is very efficient
as only the inodes being marked for reclaim take the radix tree
lock and hence there is minimal contention for it...

Cheers,

Dave.
