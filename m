Full dmesg output, please.

Because the IO errors had already shut the filesystem down, as
per the dmesg output you quoted below.

It doesn't. Something was leaked or not cleaned up properly,
preventing the filesytem from being unmounted. You know, a bug...

RHEL has an upstream first policy, so whatever bug fix you find in
a RHEL kernel is already in the upstream kernels.

Where is unmount stuck? 'echo w > /proc/sysrq-trigger' output if it
is hung, 'echo l > /proc/sysrq-trigger' if it is spinning, please?
