Even the bindmounting craziness doesn't work, because that breaks
systems where msmtp is set up as the MTA, but not to listen on port 25
of ::1.  At this point maybe I'll just revert to the approach that we
had prior to commit 9042fcc08eed ("xfs_scrub_fail: tighten up the
security on the background systemd service") and run with unrestricted
privileges as user mail.  Then setgid works fine.
