That /is/ how they do it currently.  The goal here was to reduce the
number of scripts that then must be worked into every distro's bespoke
initrd generation system (update-initramfs, dracut, etc.).  Doing this
from systemd bypasses that, and it means it can get done in the
background during first boot, instead of rewriting superblocks in the
singlethreaded initramfs hot path during deployments.

They need the fsuuid to change after the VM starts up, but it doesn't
have to get done until just before we start handing out NFS leases.
Granted that was before we hit the wall of "lots of subsystems encode
the fs uuid into things and hand them out"...

I can't think of any, and was assuming that Catherine did that to
maintain parity with the offline fsuuid setting command...
