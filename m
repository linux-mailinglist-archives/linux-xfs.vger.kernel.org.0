They already do that, because the AG headers are where we store the
btree block counts.

Is that with reflink enabled?  Reflink always scans the right edge of
the refcount btree at mount to clean out stale COW staging extents, and
(prior to the introduction of the inode btree counts feature last year)
we also ahad to walk the entire finobt to find out how big it is.

TBH I think the COW recovery and the AG block reservation pieces are
prime candidates for throwing at an xfs_pwork workqueue so we can
perform those scans in parallel.

Perhaps not, but the horse bolted 5 years ago. :/
