Hmm, now that's interesting -- using the AF ("allocation fencing"?)
capability to constrain allocations to a subset of AGs, and then slowly
rewriting files and whatnot to migrate data to other AGs.  Eventually
you end up with an AG that's empty and therefore ready for shrink.

That's definitely a different way to do that than what I did (add a
"mapfree" ioctl to pin space to a file).  I'll ponder these 2 approaches
a bit more.
