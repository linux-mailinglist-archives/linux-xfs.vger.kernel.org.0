Fair enough.  It's a sharedcode library.

Not quite what the v3 series does, but only because it's still stuck
with "whack the bcache and then go see what happened to each buftarg".

Yep, that's exactly where I moved the cleanup call in v3.

I'm assuming this means you've killed off the buffer handling parts of
struct libxfs_xinit too?

...or just throw them at me in whatever state they're in now and let me
help figure out how to get there?

Everyone: don't be afraid of the 'RFCRAP' for interim patchsets.
Granted, posting git branches with a timestamp might be more
