The intent of the patch was to limit the scope of the heuristic to
the background (non-sync) scan where there are no real guarantees or
predictability. Otherwise I would expect a sync scan to bypass the
heuristic and prioritize the need to free space.

This is similar to the existing dirty pagecache check for eofblocks
inodes, but I notice that the same check for cowblocks inodes doesn't
seem to care about the type of scan. I suppose one thing to consider for
why that might not matter that much is that IIRC usually this sort of
-ENOSPC handling is preceded by a full fs flush, which probably reduces
the significance of a sync check filter (or lack thereof).

Yeah, it seems like it depends on the calling context. I.e.,
xfs_file_buffered_write() -> xfs_blockgc_free_quota() passes the sync
flag for the -EDQUOT case. That case doesn't invoke a flush for -EDQUOT
since it's a a specific quota failure, so ISTM this isn't that much of a
departure from the existing heuristic (which skips cowblocks inodes that
are dirty). Is there a case I'm missing?

The question that comes to mind to me is whether those dirty checks in
xfs_prep_free_cowblocks() are more of a correctness thing than a
heuristic..? For example, is that to prevent races between things like
writes allocating some cowblocks and blockgc coming along and removing
them before I/O completes, which actually expects them to exist for
remapping? If so, I suppose that would make me want to tweak the change
a bit to perhaps make the open check first and combine the comments to
better explain what is heuristic and what is rule, but that's only if we
want to keep the patch..
