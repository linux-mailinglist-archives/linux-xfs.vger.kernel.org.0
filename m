Not yet, because the patch stack it is build on top of has a bunch
of other WIP, not-quite-fully-working stuff in it so I haven't been
able to run it through a full fstests pass yet (hence the RFC tag).
The next version (hopefully early next week) will be rebased
directly on top of the CIL scalability work and I'll push out those
branches into a git tree when it's actually been more fully tested
and survived some recovery stress looping.

Cheers,

Dave.
