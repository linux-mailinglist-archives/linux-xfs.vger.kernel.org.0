So was the RISC-V architecture added to the ubuntu build between the
uploads of the previous version of xfsprogs and xfsprogs-5.10.0? Or
is this an actual regression where the maintainer signed tarball had
RISC-V support in it and now it doesn't?

FWIW, where are you getting the tarballs from? Are you downloading
the maintainer signed tarballs from here:

https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/fs/xfs/xfsprogs/

Or pulling the git.kernel.org built tarball that is autogenerated
from the release tag?

That sounds wrong. AIUI, autoreconf doesn't copy in anything.

$ man 7 dh-autoreconf
....
CAVEATS
       dh_autoreconf is mostly a superset of the
       dh_update_autotools_config debhelper command included in
       debhelper since version 9.20160115. When using the dh
       sequencer, dh_update_autotools_config is run before
       dh_autoreconf and updates the config.guess and config.sub
       files. This is required in cases where autoreconf does not
       update config.guess and config.sub itself.

So isn't the dh_update_autotools_config call in the wrong place
here?

Cheers,

Dave.
