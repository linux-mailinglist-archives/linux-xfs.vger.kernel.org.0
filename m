Ok, then we should be able to get those changes upstream.

Well that's not what I said. ;P I'm pointing out that as of right now
this is a downstream only use case. I know there was upstream
communication and patches posted, etc., but that was a while ago and it
wasn't clear to me if there was still intent to get things merged
upstream. If not, then the only real outcome here for anybody outside of
FB is bitrot.

I'm not sure if I'm digging out the right mails... it appears there was
decent upstream activity at first (up to a v7 [1] across a period of
months). Since then, I don't see any updates in over two years..
