The error (-ENOSPC) comes from this v5.10 code in xfs_dir_ialloc():

        if (!ialloc_context && !ip) {
                *ipp = NULL;
                return -ENOSPC;
        }

Which theoretically might trip after xfs_ialloc() has marked the transaction
dirty(?).

This specific code is gone with this cleanup series in v5.11:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20201209112820.114863-1-hsiangkao@redhat.com/

When the $SUBJECT patch is applied to v5.11.16 the test xfs/076 does not fail.

So either the $SUBJECT patch (from 5.12) is incompatible with v5.10 code
or the cleanup series somehow managed to make my system not reproduce
the bug anymore.

I will assume the former and drop this patch from v5.10.y candidates.
If you want me to continue to research the bug on v5.10 let me know
what else you want me to check.

Thanks,
Amir.
