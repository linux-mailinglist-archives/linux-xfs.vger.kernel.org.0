No. We do not need a transaction roll there if we rebuild a new
xefi list with the remaining extents from the original efi. At that
point, we call:

	<create transaction>
	<free first extent>
	<create new xefi list>
	<create and log EFD>
	xfs_defer_ops_capture_and_commit()
	  xfs_defer_ops_capture()
	    xfs_defer_create_intents()
	      for each tp->t_dfops
	        ->create intent
		  xfs_extent_free_create_intent()
		    create new EFI
		    walk each xefi and add it to the new intent
	    <captures remaining defered work>
	  xfs_trans_commit()

i.e. xfs_defer_ops_capture_and_commit() can builds new EFI for us
from the xefi list as part of defering the work that remains to be
done. Once it has done that, it queues the remaining work and
commits the transaction. Hence all we need to do in recovery of the
first extent is free it, create the xefi list and log the full EFD.
xfs_defer_ops_capture_and_commit() does the rest.

Yes, because logging the full EFD cancels the original EFI and so it
no longer consumes log space. hence we can log a new EFI using the
space the original EFI consumed.

Yes it can. The only thing that matters is that the EFD and new EFI
are committed in the same transaction. Remember: transactions are
atomic change sets - either all the changes in the transaction are
replayed on recovery, or none of them are.
