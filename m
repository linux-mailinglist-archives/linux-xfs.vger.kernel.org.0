I'm not sure that assumption is always true. If the iclog is (was)
WANT_SYNC, for example, then it's already been switched out from the
head of that list. That might only happen if a checkpoint happens to
align nicely with the end of an iclog, but that's certainly possible. We
also need to consider that ->l_icloglock cycles here and thus somebody
else could switch out the head iclog..

I think this change is fundamentally correct based on the simple fact
that we only ever set XLOG_STATE_IOERROR in the shutdown path. That
said, the assert would be potentially racy against the shutdown path
without any ordering guarantee that the release path might see the iclog
state update prior to the log state update and lead to a potentially
false negative assert failure. I suspect this is why the shutdown call
might have been made from here in the first place (and partly why I
didn't bother with it in the restored locked state check).

Given the context of this patch (fixing a regression) and the practical
history of this code (and the annoying process of identifying and
tracking down the source of these kind of shutdown buglets), I'm
inclined to have this patch preserve the historical and relatively
proven behavior as much as possible and consider further cleanups
separately...
