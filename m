The downside of getting rid of the checks for directories is that we
won't be able to use the error injection knob that limits all forks to
10 extents max to see what happens when that part of directory expansion
fails.  But if it makes it easier to handle nrext64, then that's
probably a good enough reason to forego that.

Those are probably ok to remove the checks.

Not sure about this one, since it actually /can/ result in more extents.
