Well, ok, but it would have been nice for the cover letter to give
/some/ hint as to what's changing in various subranges, e.g.

"Patches 32-36 reduce the xc_cil_lock critical sections,
 Patches 37-41 create per-cpu cil structures and move log items and
       vectors to use them,
 Patches 42-44 are more cleanups,
 Patch 45 documents the whole mess."

So I could see the outlines of where the 45 patches were going.
