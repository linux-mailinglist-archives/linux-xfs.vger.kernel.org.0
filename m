A week's worth of digging later:

Actually, no debconf magic -- Debian policy is to enable any service
shipped in a package, by default:

https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#starting-system-services

"Debian packages that provide system services should arrange for those
services to be automatically started and stopped by the init system or
service manager."

It's up to the sysadmin to disable this behavior, either by installing
their own systemd preset file:

https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/systemd/systemd.preset.5.en.html

that shuts off the services they don't want (or more likely enables only
the ones they do want).  Other people have proposed rc.d hacks:

https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/policy-rcd-declarative-deny-all

which prevent the postinst scripts from actually triggering the service.

Though I guess we /could/ decide to ship only the
xfs_scrub_all.{service,timer} files in a totally separate package.  But
that will make packaging more difficult because now we have to have
per-package .install files so that debconf knows where to put the files,
and then we have to split the package scripts too.

On Fedora it's apparently the other way 'round where one has to turn on
services manually.
