Inode reclaim is quite different now to the way described in various
comments, so update all the comments explaining what it does and how
it works.

+ * Inode reclaim is non-blocking, so the default action if progress cannot be

+ * XFS_IRECLAIM flag.  If we are in a shutdown state, we don't care about
+ * blocking anymore and hence we can wait for the inode to be able to reclaim
+ * it.
  *
- * (*) dgc: I don't think the clean, pinned state is possible but it gets
- * handled anyway given the order of checks implemented.
- *
- * Also, because we get the flush lock first, we know that any inode that has
- * been flushed delwri has had the flush completed by the time we check that
- * the inode is clean.
- *
- * Note that because the inode is flushed delayed write by AIL pushing, the
- * flush lock may already be held here and waiting on it can result in very
- * long latencies.  Hence for sync reclaims, where we wait on the flush lock,
- * the caller should push the AIL first before trying to reclaim inodes to
- * minimise the amount of time spent waiting.  For background relaim, we only
- * bother to reclaim clean inodes anyway.

- *	bad		=> reclaim
- *	shutdown	=> unpin and reclaim
- *	pinned, async	=> requeue

- *	stale		=> reclaim

+ * AIL first to trigger writeback of dirty inodes. The enbales both the
+ * writeback to be done in the background in a non-blocking manner, as well as
