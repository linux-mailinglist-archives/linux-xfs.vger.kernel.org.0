When looking at a dump of /home (but not on other partitions 
that I've noticed, I see (stopping listing on problem line)

XFSDUMP_OPTIONS=-J #(set externally , not usually)

>./dump1fs#160(Xfsdump)> xfsdump -b 268435456 -l 8 -L home -J - /home
xfsdump: using file dump (drive_simple) strategy
xfsdump: version 3.1.8 (dump format 3.0)
xfsdump: level 8 incremental dump of Ishtar:/home based on level 6 dump begun Fri Oct 29 04:30:13 2021
xfsdump: dump date: Sun Oct 31 14:20:37 2021
xfsdump: session id: 249233a0-a642-42a0-ae02-ed53012f3fa4
xfsdump: session label: "home"
xfsdump: NOTE: root ino 192 differs from mount dir ino 256, bind mount?

Of note, most things were placed in orphanage under
256.0

df shows:
df /home
Filesystem        Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/Space/Home2  2.0T  1.5T  570G  73% /home

(Became months ago as I made new partition of 2T to replace
old partition of 1.5T, after which I did another 
level-0 backup.
