From: Darrick J. Wong <darrick.wong@oracle.com>

Add a new btree function that enables us to bulk load a btree cursor.
This will be used by the upcoming online repair patches to generate new
btrees.  This avoids the programmatic inefficiency of calling
xfs_btree_insert in a loop (which generates a lot of log traffic) in
favor of stamping out new btree blocks with ordered buffers, and then
committing both the new root and scheduling the removal of the old btree
blocks in a single transaction commit.

The design of this new generic code is based off the btree rebuilding
code in xfs_repair's phase 5 code, with the explicit goal of enabling us
to share that code between scrub and repair.  It has the additional
feature of being able to control btree block loading factors.

+/*
+ * Bulk Loading of Staged Btrees
+ * =============================
+ *
+ * This interface is used with a staged btree cursor to create a totally new
+ * btree with a large number of records (i.e. more than what would fit in a
+ * single root block).  When the creation is complete, the new root can be
+ * linked atomically into the filesystem by committing the staged cursor.
+ *
+ * Creation of a new btree proceeds roughly as follows:
+ *
+ * The first step is to initialize an appropriate fake btree root structure and
+ * then construct a staged btree cursor.  Refer to the block comments about
+ * "Bulk Loading for AG Btrees" and "Bulk Loading for Inode-Rooted Btrees" for
+ * more information about how to do this.
+ *
+ * The second step is to initialize a struct xfs_btree_bload context as
+ * documented in the structure definition.
+ *
+ * The third step is to call xfs_btree_bload_compute_geometry to compute the
+ * height of and the number of blocks needed to construct the btree.  See the
+ * section "Computing the Geometry of the New Btree" for details about this
+ * computation.
+ *
+ * In step four, the caller must allocate xfs_btree_bload.nr_blocks blocks and
+ * save them for later use by ->claim_block().  Bulk loading requires all
+ * blocks to be allocated beforehand to avoid ENOSPC failures midway through a
+ * rebuild, and to minimize seek distances of the new btree.
+ *
+ * Step five is to call xfs_btree_bload() to start constructing the btree.
+ *
+ * The final step is to commit the staging btree cursor, which logs the new
+ * btree root and turns the staging cursor into a regular cursor.  The caller
+ * is responsible for cleaning up the previous btree blocks, if any.
+ *
+ * Computing the Geometry of the New Btree
+ * =======================================
+ *
+ * The number of items placed in each btree block is computed via the following
+ * algorithm: For leaf levels, the number of items for the level is nr_records
+ * in the bload structure.  For node levels, the number of items for the level
+ * is the number of blocks in the next lower level of the tree.  For each
+ * level, the desired number of items per block is defined as:
+ *
+ * desired = max(minrecs, maxrecs - slack factor)
+ *
+ * The number of blocks for the level is defined to be:
+ *
+ * blocks = floor(nr_items / desired)
+ *
+ * Note this is rounded down so that the npb calculation below will never fall
+ * below minrecs.  The number of items that will actually be loaded into each
+ * btree block is defined as:
+ *
+ * npb =  nr_items / blocks
+ *
+ * Some of the leftmost blocks in the level will contain one extra record as
+ * needed to handle uneven division.  If the number of records in any block
+ * would exceed maxrecs for that level, blocks is incremented and npb is
+ * recalculated.
+ *
+ * In other words, we compute the number of blocks needed to satisfy a given
+ * loading level, then spread the items as evenly as possible.
+ *
+ * The height and number of fs blocks required to create the btree are computed
+ * and returned via btree_height and nr_blocks.
+ */

+ * The btree blocks will be written to disk when bulk loading is finished.
