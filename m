I thought this was generally safe as freeze protection sits outside of
the locks, but I'm not terribly sure about the read to a mapped buffer
case. If that allows an iolock holder to block on a pagefault due to
freeze, then SB_FREEZE_PAGEFAULT might be too late for a synchronous
scan (i.e. assuming nothing blocks this earlier or prefaults/pins the
target buffer)..?

Do you have any more detailed data on this? I.e., is this an increase
across the board? A smaller set of tests doing many freezes with a
significant runtime increase?

I'm a little on the fence about this because personally, I'm not
terribly concerned about the performance of a single freeze call. At the
same time, I could see this adding up across hundreds of cycles or
whatever via a test or test suite, and that being potentially annoying
to devs/testers.

That kind of sounds like the tradeoff of impacting the current/active fs
for the benefit of a snapshot that may or may not be used. If not, then
it's a waste of time. If so, it might be beneficial for the snap to more
accurately reflect the "eventual" state of the original. For cowblocks
perhaps it doesn't matter if the mount/recovery will scan and reclaim.
I'm not as sure for eofblocks, wouldn't the snap persist all that
"intended to be transient" speculative prealloc until/unless said files
are reopened/closed?

Seems a reasonable option. Presumably that mitigates the lookup stalling
behavior without the need for any additional scanning work at freeze
time (and maybe eliminates the need for an inodegc flush too), but is
neutral wrt some of the other tradeoffs (like the above). I think the
former is the big question wrt to deferred inactivation whereas the
latter has been the case forever.

BTW, should we care at all about somebody dropping the entire cached
working set (worst case) onto these queues if the fs is frozen? Maybe
not if we have to cycle through all these inodes anyways for a full
working set eviction, and presumably a large evictor task (i.e.
drop_caches) will minimize the percpu queue distribution...
