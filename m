I wasn't going to fix sunvdc, I'm pretty sure I don't even have access to
the relevant hardware. ;)

That said... people send me a surprising number of bug reports that
start with "My hardware is really flaky..." and end with "...and I want
you to go to extraordinary lengths to work around all of that in
software!"

Apologies for my own defensive reaction, your report merely wanted
"...can we have some non-weird behavior from the page cache?"

So would I, but the longstanding behavior of FICLONE is that it's an
implied fsync, so it's *vital* that calling programs do not drop the EIO
on the floor like cp does.

Another dumb thing about how the pagecache tracks errors is that it sets
a single state bit for the whole mapping, which means that we can't
actually /tell/ userspace which part of their file is now busted.  We
can't even tell if userspace has successfully rewrite()d all the regions
where writeback failed, which leads me to...

Another another dumb thing about how the pagecache tracks errors is that
any fsync-lik operation will test_and_clear_bit the EIO state, which
means that if we find a past EIO, we'll clear that state and return the
EIO to userspace.

We /could/ change FICLONE to flush the dirty pagecache, sample the EIO
status *without* clearing it, and return EIO if it's set.  That's
probably the most unabsurd way to deal with this, but it's unsettling
that even cp ignores errno returns now.  The manpage for FICLONE doesn't
explicitly mention any fsync behaviors, so perhaps "flush and retain
EIO" is the right choice here.
