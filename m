Certainly better than an opencoded PF_$FOO manipulation

I would just ask for a clarification because this is rellying to have a
good MM knowledge to follow

I would go with.
Tell the memory management that the caller is working on behalf of the
background memory reclaim (aka kswapd) and help it to make a forward
progress. That means that it will get an access to memory reserves
should there be a need to allocate memory in order to make a forward
progress. Note that the caller has to be extremely careful when doing
that.

Or something like that.
