Hmmm.  Recently I've been wrangling with a concurrency problem between
scrub and io threads running a series of different AG btree updates
(e.g. bunmap, which runs a deferred rmap-delete and then a deferred
refcount-decrease).  Because the only way we serialize access to the AGs
is through the AG buffer locks and we don't maintain that lock across
the transaction roll between defer items, it's possible that scrub can
step in and grab the buffer lock between items, which it then marks as
cross-reference corruption because the number of rmaps for a given block
doesn't match the number of references in the refcount btree.  The log
intent items guarantee consistency (and the defer items are queue in the
correct order to avoid accidental freeing) but this is suboptimal.

Right now I've "fixed" it by adding a per-ag counter of pending intents
and adapting scrub to lock the AG buffers, check the counter, and if
it's nonzero, it'll cycle the buffers and try again.  This works, but
it's a little silly.  Depending on how the AG mutex works, this could
fix that problem for scrub.

That's gonna hurt on explodefs filesystems with a million AGs... ;)

Ok, I'm satisfied.
