No. That is not the filesystem image that is being asked for. The
syzkaller reproducer (i.e. what you call repro.c) contructs a
filesystem image in it's own memory which it then mounts and runs
the test operations on.  That's the filesystem image that we need
extracted into a separate image file because that's the one that is
corrupted and we need to look at when triaging these issues.
Google's syzbot does this now, so your syzkaller bot should also be
able to do it.

Please go and talk to the syzkaller authors to find out how they
extract filesystem images from the reproducer, and any other
information they've also been asked to provide for triage
purposes.

-Dave.
