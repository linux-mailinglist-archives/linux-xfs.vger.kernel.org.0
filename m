...which comes at a cost of making *us* figure out some gross hack to
retrofit that into the protofile format.

The easiest hack I can think of is to amend the protofile parser to
change any slash in the name to a space before creating the directory
entry.  Slashes aren't allowed (and right now produce a corrupt
filesystem) so I guess that's the easy way out:

# cat /tmp/protofile
/
0 0

 get/isk.sh   ---775 1000 1000 /code/t/fstests/getdisk.sh

Would that (replace slash with space) help?
