Yes and yes.

targeted is one way to describe it, the other way to look at it is
that xfs_bmapi_write is used where the callers want to allocate
real (or unwritten) extents for a range, which just happens to
convert delalloc as a side-effect as those callers don't want to
deal with delalloc extents.

So as mentioned in the cover letter I'm quite worried about the
new behavior we expose here as we always converted delalloc
extents from the start and tried to convert it to the end,
and this now changes that.  So while the changes looks quite
simple they expose a lot of previously untested code and behavior.

It's probably the right thing to do but quite risky, let me know
what you think about it.
