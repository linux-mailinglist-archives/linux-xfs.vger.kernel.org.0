What does this acheive? It only prevents the unaligned segment from
being merged, it doesn't prevent it from being added to a new bvec.

However, the case here is that:

The second page added to the bvec is actually offset alignedr. Hence
the check would do nothing on the first page because the bvec array
is empty (so goes into a new bvec anyway), and the check on the
second page would do nothing an it would merge with first because
the offset is aligned correctly. In both cases, the length of the
segment is not aligned, so that needs to be checked, too.

IOWs, I think the check needs to be in bio_add_page, it needs to
check both the offset and length for alignment, and it needs to grab
the alignment from queue_dma_alignment(), not use a hard coded value
of 511.

Cheers,

Dave.
