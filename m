Subject: [PATCH v2] generic: disable dmlogwrites tests on XFS
Date:   Thu, 27 Aug 2020 10:53:29 -0400
Message-Id: <20200827145329.435398-1-bfoster@redhat.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
X-Scanned-By: MIMEDefang 2.79 on 10.5.11.11

Several generic fstests use dm-log-writes to test the filesystem for
consistency at various crash recovery points. dm-log-writes and the
associated replay mechanism rely on discard to clear stale blocks
when moving to various points in time of the fs. If the storage
doesn't provide discard zeroing or the discard requests exceed the
hardcoded maximum (128MB) of the fallback solution to physically
write zeroes, stale blocks are left around in the target fs. This
causes issues on XFS if recovery observes metadata from a future
version of an fs that has been replayed to an older point in time.
This corrupts the filesystem and leads to spurious test failures
that are nontrivial to diagnose.

Disable the generic dmlogwrites tests on XFS for the time being.
This is intended to be a temporary change until a solution is found
that allows these tests to predictably clear stale data while still
allowing them to run in a reasonable amount of time.
