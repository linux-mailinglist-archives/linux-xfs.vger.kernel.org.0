In the current tree after the folio/vmalloc series b_addr is only
assigned during buffer allocation.  But I suspect they tested before that
where b_addr can be set at runtime.  Either way it always happens under
b_sema because that is initialized to locked just after allocating
the memory for the buffer.

I'm more than happy to address these, because proper documentation
of concurrency helps fixing a huge number of bugs, and also really
helps documenting the code.  I hate having to spend hours trying to
figure out why something can be safely used lockless or not.

I'm not sure who "we" is, but I've always pushed back to hacks just
to shut up lockdep.  And at the same time I'm immensively grateful
for having lockdep and can't think of working without it anymore.

Functions never are racy, specific data access are.  So a function wide
assignment is just the dumbest thing ever, this already badly failed
for things like early Java object-level synchronization.

But not all access are racy.  We rely on proper synchronized accesses
for accounting.  Now for something that has a lot of unsynchronized
access, adding a wrapper for them might be fine, but for i_delayed_blks
I don't think we actually have enough for them to bother.

And also drop a lot of the actually useful checks. That's exaxctly
the kind of hack you rant about above.
