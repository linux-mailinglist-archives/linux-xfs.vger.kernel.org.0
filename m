I use 72 columns for emails and commit messages, and 79 for code.

Though to be honest that's just my editor settings; I'm sure interested
parties could find plenty of instances where my enforcement of even that
is totally lax --

I have enough of a difficult time finding all the subtle bugs and corner
case design problems in the kernel code (which will cause problems in
our users' lives) that so long as you're not obviously going past the
flaming red stripe that I told vim to put at column 80, I don't really
care (because maxcolumns errors don't usually cause data loss). :)

(Not trying to say that peoples' code is crap, I'm just laying out where
I put maxcolumns in my priority barrel.)
