File creation shouldn't ever run into problems with
xfs_iext_count_may_overflow because (a) only symlinks get created with
mapped blocks, and never more than two; and (b) we always set NREXT64
(the inode flag) on new files if NREXT64 (the superblock feature bit) is
enabled, so a newly created file will never require upgrading.
