Some filesystems do treat the sgid behavior of directories special (some
network filesystems do where they send that information to the server
before updating the inode afair). So I'd rather not do that in there as
we're risking breaking expectations and it's a very sensitive change.

Plus, the logic is encapsulated in the vfs generic setattr_copy() helper
which nearly all filesystems call.

So specifically for chown():
1. if regfile
   -> strip suid bit unconditionally
   -> strip sgid bit if inode has sgid bit and file is group-executable
2. if directory
   -> strip sgid bit if inode's gid is neither among the caller's groups
      nor is the caller capable wrt to that inode
The behavior described in 2. is encoded in the vfs generic
setattr_copy() helper. And that is what we should see.

The behavior of ext4 and btrfs is what we should see afaict as both use
setattr_copy().

Hm, if you look above, then you can see that the failure (or difference
in behavior) you're reporting is independent of idmapped mounts. An
ext4 directory shows different behavior than an xfs directory on a
regular system without any idmapped mounts used. So I'm not clear how
that's specifically related to idmapped mounts yet.

Fwiw, one part in your commit message is a bit misleading:

> > > > has CAP_FSETID capable in init_user_ns rather than mntns userns.

that's not what capable_wrt_to_inode_uidgid() does. What it does is to
check whether the caller is capable in their current user namespace.
That's how capable_wrt_to_inode_uidgid() has always worked.
The mnt_userns is only used to idmap the inode's {g,u}id. So if the
caller has CAP_FSETID in its current userns and the inode's {g,u}id have
a valid mapping in the mnt's userns the caller is considered privileged
over that inode.
