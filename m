Looks like a io_uring/fio bugs at this point, Jens. All your go fast
bits turns the buffered read into a short read, and neither fio nor
io_uring async buffered read path handle short reads. Details below.

Also, the block_rq_* trace points appear to emit corrupt trace
records that crash trace-cmd. That probably needs to be looked into
as well:

$ sudo trace-cmd record -e xfs_file\* -e iomap\* -e block_bio\* -e
block_rq_complete -e printk fio tests/io_uring_corruption.fio
.....

So I updated to the current 5.9 whcih has all the new async buffered
read stuff in it to see if that fixed the problem, but it didn't.
Instead, it actually made this problem occur almost instantenously.

I could put the above trace code back in and it didn't purturb the
situation, either. Neither did writeback, which I was now able to
confirm didn't actually impact on this problem at all.

The problem is, instead, reads racing with readahead completion.
There is no page cache corruption at all, just fio is reusing
buffers that contain stale data from previous read IO and hence any
part of the buffer that doesn't get updated by the read IO ends up
being detected as "corrupt" because they already contain stale data.

The problem is clear from this sequence trace:

What we see is -3- calls to do the buffered read. The first call
triggers readahead and we can see iomap map the file offset and
issue the bio. This is IOCB_NOWAIT context, so this is actually
broken as we can block for a long time in this path (e.g. on
inode locks).

Once the IO is issued, we see a second xfs_file_buffered_read trace
with the return value in the count - that's -EAGAIN because
IOCB_NOWAIT is set and now we are going to block waiting for IO.

Immediately after this, the io_uring code issues the buffered read
again, only this time with IOCB_WAITQ|IOCB_NOWAIT set and it hits
the "page not up to date" path. This then hits
__wait_on_page_locked_async() which sets the PageWaiter bit and
returns -EIOCBQUEUED to tell the caller that it has been queued.

About a millisecond later, the readahead IO completes, and the block
layer logs it. This ends up calling iomap_read_end_io() which walks
each page(bvec) in the bio, marks them uptodate and unlocks them.
The first page unlock sees the PageWaiter bit, which then does a

        wake_up_page_bit(page, PG_locked);

because the PageWaiter bit is set. We see the same io_uring worker
thread then immmediately re-issue the buffered read and it does it
with IOCB_WAITQ|IOCB_NOWAIT context. This gets the first page, then
finds the second page not up to date or has to block trying to lock
it. It aborts the read at that point, and because we've already read
a page it returns 4096 bytes read.

I left the post-buffered read IO completions that were being run by
the block layer to show that the buffered read was issued and
completed while the block layer was still processing the readahead
bio completion.

At this point (a positive byte count being returned) the io_uring
layer considers the IO done and returns the result to the userspace
app. Fio then completely fails to check for a short read despite
being in "verify" mode and instead yells about corruption due to
stale data that it had left in the buffer that it passed the
kernel....

IOWs, there does not appear to be a filesystem or page cache issue
here at all - it's just an unhandled short read.

Jens, if strace worked on io_uring, I wouldn't have wasted 2 and
half days tracking this down. It would have taken 5 minutes with
strace and it would have been totally obvious. I'd suggest this
needs addressing as a matter of priority over everything else for
io_uring....

Cheers, 

Dave.
