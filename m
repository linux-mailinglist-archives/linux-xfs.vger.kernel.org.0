Nope! :D

IIRC Dave also expressed interested in performance impacts the last time
I sent this series, albeit more from the perspective of quantifying how
much pain we'd incur from forcing all writes to perform an unwritten
extent conversion at the end.

FWIW after months of running this on my internal systems, I haven't been
able to quantify any significant difference before and after, even with
rmap enabled.  There's slightly more log traffic from the extra
bmbt/rmapbt/inode core updates, but even then the log is fairly good at
deduping repeated updates.  Both transactions usually commit before the
log checkpoints.

Frankly I wouldn't apply this patch (or 'xfs: extend the range of
flush_unmap ranges') on the grounds that re-opening potential disclosure
flaws is never worth the risk.  I'm also pretty sure that being careful
to convert delalloc data fork extents to unwritten extents fixes the
stale disclosure flaw that Ritesh wrote about in ('iomap: direct-io:
Move inode_dio_begin before filemap_write_and_wait_range').

(As far as ext4 goes, I talked to Jan and Ted this morning and they
seemed to think that they could solve the race on their end by retaining
the unwritten state in the incore extent cache because ext4 apparently
doesn't commit the extent map update transaction until after writeback
completes.)
