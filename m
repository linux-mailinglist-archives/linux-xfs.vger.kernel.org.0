I'm curious to see what xfs_repair complained about if you have a record
of it. That might call out some other things we could be overlooking.

Yeah, I could see that being an issue. I'm curious if we're exposed to
that problem with exact allocation requests in other places.  We only
use it in a couple places that look like they have fallback allocation
requests. Combine that with the pre-allocation space checks and perhaps
this isn't something we'd currently hit in practice.

That said, I don't think this justifies diving directly into the lower
levels of the allocator (or branching any of the code, etc.). I suspect
not doing the agfl fixups and whatnot could cause other problems if they
are ultimately required for the subsequent allocation. The easiest
workaround is to just commit the transaction instead of cancelling it
once the allocation call is made. A more involved followon fix might be
to improve the early checks for exact allocations, but it's not clear at
this stage if that's really worth the extra code. We might also
eventually want to handle that another way to ensure that the agfl fixup
doesn't actually do an allocation that conflicts with the shrink itself.

I'd just work around it as above for now. It's a fairly minor
distraction with respect to the feature.

It's probably debatable as to whether we should reduce the size of the
shrink or just fail the operation, but I think to increase the size of
the shrink from what the user requested (even if it occurs "by accident"
due to the AG size rules) is inappropriate. With regard to the former,
have you looked into how shrink behaves on other filesystems (ext4)? I
think one advantage of shrinking what's available is to at least give
the user an opportunity to make incremental progress.

I'm not sure we need to split out the entire function. It just might
make some sense to refactor the existing code a bit so the common code
is clearly readable for shrink/grow and that any larger hunks of code
specific to either grow or shrink are factored out into separate
functions.
