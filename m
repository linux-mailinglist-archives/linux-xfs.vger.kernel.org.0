I'm sorry for replying so late.

This situation should not exist.
scan_bmapbt() performs the following checks:
1. Check the magic of the block
2. Check the level of the block
3. Check which inode the owner of the block belongs to.
4. If it is a V5 filesystem,it will check three items: UUID, block consistency,
and which inode the block belongs to.
5. Calculate which AG the block belongs to and see the usage of the block
6. If it is a leaf node, it will check whether the number of records exceeds the maximum value

xfs_bmbt_write_verify() performs the following checks:
1. Check the magic of the block
2. If it is a V5 filesystem,it will check three items: UUID, block consistency,
and which inode the block belongs to.
3. Check if the level of the block is within the specified range
4. Check if the number of nodes in the block record exceeds the maximum limit
5. Check if the left and right nodes of the block are within the range of the file system

As can be seen from above, scan_bmapbt() checks more and in more detail than
xfs_bmbt_write_verify(). Therefore, if scan_bmapbt() returns 0,
xfs_bmbt_write_verify() will not report an error.

We can allocate space in process_btinode() and pass it to scan_lbtree/scan_bmapbt.
If a bp is set as dirty, we record it. If the inode needs to be cleaned up,
we set all recorded bps as stale.However, this does not affect the repair process.
Even if no record is kept, it only adds some unnecessary data writing.

If there is nothing wrong with this，I will push V2 patch.

Thanks
