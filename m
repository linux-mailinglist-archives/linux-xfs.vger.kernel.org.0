I managed to collect some preliminary data based on this strategy. I
regenerated the associated dataset as I wanted to introduce more near
mode allocation events where locality is relevant/measurable. The set is
still generated via filebench, but the workload now runs file 8x file
creators in parallel with 16x random size file appenders (with 1% of the
dataset being preallocated to support the appends, and thus without
contention). In total, it creates 10k files that amount to ~5.8TB of
space. The filesystem geometry is as follows:

meta-data=/dev/mapper/fedora_hpe--apollo--cn99xx--19-tmp isize=512    agcount=8, agsize=268435455 blks
         =                       sectsz=4096  attr=2, projid32bit=1
         =                       crc=1        finobt=1, sparse=1, rmapbt=0
         =                       reflink=0
data     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=1941012480, imaxpct=5
         =                       sunit=0      swidth=0 blks
naming   =version 2              bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0, ftype=1
log      =internal log           bsize=4096   blocks=521728, version=2
         =                       sectsz=4096  sunit=1 blks, lazy-count=1
realtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0

The locality data is collected via a hacked up variant of 'xfs_db -c
frag ...' that reuses the 'freesp' command histogram to display locality
deltas instead of extent lengths. Each bucket shows how many
extents/allocs fall into that particular delta range and the average
length of the associated extents. Note that the percent column is based
on extent count vs the total (not block or delta counts). Finally, note
that the final row uses a dummy value of agsize to account AG jumps. As
such, the associated delta values are invalid, but the extent count/size
values are valid. This data is included to provide some insight on how
often we fall back to external AGs (from the locality target) due to
contention.

Bear in mind that so far I've only run this workload once on each kernel
and I believe there is opportunity for variance run-to-run. Current data
and observations follow:

Firstly, comparison of the baseline and control data shows that near
mode allocation is effective at improving allocation locality compared
to size mode. In both cases, the 1048576-4194304 buckets hold the
majority of extents. If we look at the sub-1048576 data, however, ~40%
of allocations land in this range on the baseline kernel vs. only ~16%
for the control. Another interesting data point is the noticeable drop
in AG skips (~24k) from the baseline kernel to the control (~15k). I
suspect this is due to the additional overhead of locality based
allocation causing more contention.

Comparison of the baseline and test data shows a generally similar
breakdown between the two. The sub-1048576 range populates the same
buckets and makes up ~41% of the total extents. The per-bucket numbers
differ, but all of the buckets are within a percentage point or so. One
previously unknown advantage of the test algorithm shown by this data is
that the number of AG skips drops down to ~18k, which almost splits the
difference between the baseline and control (and slightly in favor of
the latter). I suspect that is related to the more simple and bounded
near mode algorithm as compared to the current 

Thoughts on any of this data or presentation? I could dig further into
details or alternatively base the histogram on something like extent
size and show the average delta for each extent size bucket, but I'm not
sure that will tell us anything profound with respect to this patchset.
One thing I noticed while processing this data is that the current
dataset skews heavily towards smaller allocations. I still think it's a
useful comparison because smaller allocations are more likely to stress
either algorithm via a larger locality search space, but I may try to
repeat this test with a workload with fewer files and larger allocations
and see how that changes things.
