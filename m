In this case b_nmaps must already be 1, right. And it's the bn and
length in b_maps[0] that fail to be initialized?

I wonder, then, if it's any more clear to reorganize it just a little bit,
like:

         if (!bp->b_maps) {
                 bp->b_maps = &bp->__b_map;
                 bp->b_nmaps = 1;
         }

         if (bp->b_maps == &bp->__b_map) {
                 bp->b_maps[0].bm_bn = bp->b_bn;
                 bp->b_maps[0].bm_len = bp->b_length;
         }

because AFAICT b_nmaps only needs to be reset to 1 if we didn't already
get here with b_maps == &__b_map?

If this is just navel-gazing I can leave it as is. If you think it's
any clearer, I'll make the change. (or if I've gotten it completely wrong,
sorry!)

Thanks,
