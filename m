I've run across this a few times working on the delayed attr series too. 
Sometimes I'll just have to go through the kernel side patches and find 
the missing pieces and port them myself just to get things to seat 
correctly.  Eventually the xfsprogs side catches up, but it would seem 
to me that if we all did this it would help to catch up the user space 
side and keep it maintained.  I've often wondered how one person manages 
to keep up with that!  :-)
