Hi all,

This series makes a few adjustments to the code that creates a sample
XFS filesystem containing all types of metadata.  The first patch fixes
the btree-format xattr creation code to ensure that we'll actually end
up with such a structure.

The last two patches adjust the large directories that get created to
be a closer match for what people really create on production systems.
Most directories contain many more files than subdirectories, and the
deletion rates are generally not 50%.  As online fsck moves closer to
merging, we'd really like fstests to create XFS filesystems that are
representative of what people do with XFS.

If you're going to start using this mess, you probably ought to just
pull from my git trees, which are linked below.

This is an extraordinary way to destroy everything.  Enjoy!
Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
