Aha, so we ended up more or less agreeing on the code fix but via two
verrrry different paths (organizational knowledge vs. interpreting the
code).

I'd be fine with pasting in both, along with a note that while we agree
on the code fix we arrived at it for different reasons ... if you think
that Christoph's RFC cleanup is a reasonable thing to bundle in right
after it.

It looks ok to me (once I cleaned up the build robot complaints) coming
from the narrower perspective of looking at iforks as they are now and
as they would become, FWIW, but since you know more about the historical
design points I'm curious what you think. :)
