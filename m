It's no different to the xfs_iflush_int() code that runs a heap of
checks on the in-memory inode before it is flushed to the backing
buffer. That uses a combination of open coded checks (for error
injection) and verifier functions (e.g. fork checking), so this
really isn't that unusual.

Realistically, it's better to catch the corruption as early as
possible - if we catch it here we know we corrupted the in-memory
dquot. However, if the write verifier catches it we have no idea
exactly when the corruption occurred, or whether it was a result of
a code problem or an external memory corruption in memory we haven't
modified at all...

IOWs the two checks or intended to catch very different classes of
in-memory corruptions, so they really aren't redundant or
unnecessary at all...

Cheers,

Dave.
