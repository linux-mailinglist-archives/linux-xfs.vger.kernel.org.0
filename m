If a shut races with xfs_trans_commit() and we have shut down the
filesystem but not the log, we will still cancel the transaction.
This can result in aborting dirty log items instead of committing and
pinning them whilst the log is still running. Hence we can end up
with dirty, unlogged metadata that isn't in the AIL in memory that
can be flushed to disk via writeback clustering.

This was discovered from a g/388 trace where an inode log item was
having IO completed on it and it wasn't in the AIL, hence tripping
asserts xfs_ail_check(). Inode cluster writeback started long after
the filesystem shutdown started, and long after the transaction
containing the dirty inode was aborted and the log item marked
XFS_LI_ABORTED. The inode was seen as dirty and unpinned, so it
was flushed. IO completion tried to remove the inode from the AIL,
at which point stuff went bad:

 XFS (pmem1): Log I/O Error (0x6) detected at xfs_fs_goingdown+0xa3/0xf0 (fs/xfs/xfs_fsops.c:500).  Shutting down filesystem.
 XFS: Assertion failed: in_ail, file: fs/xfs/xfs_trans_ail.c, line: 67

xfs_trans_commit() needs to check log state for shutdown, not mount
state. It cannot abort dirty log items while the log is still
running as dirty items must remained pinned in memory until they are
either committed to the journal or the log has shut down and they
can be safely tossed away. Hence if the log has not shut down, the
xfs_trans_commit() path must allow completed transactions to commit
to the CIL and pin the dirty items even if a mount shutdown has
started.
