Hi Darrick,

This is more along the lines of what I was thinking. Unfortunately,
xfs_fs_map_blocks() can't be made to use file based VFS helpers, so
the whole "open code the permissions stripping on data extent
allocation" thing needs to remain in that code. Otherwise, we can
significantly clean up xfs_file_fallocate() and completely remove
the entire transaction that sets the prealloc flag. And given that
xfs_ioc_space() no longer exists, most of the option functionality
that xfs_update_prealloc_flags() provides is no longer necessary...

This is only smoke tested so far, but I think it gets us the same
benefits but also makes the code a lot simpler at the same time.
Your thoughts?

-Dave.
