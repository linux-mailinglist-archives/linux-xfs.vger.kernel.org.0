Ok.

Right, in the reflink case we may have to roll the transaction many more
times to do the refcount btree and reverse map btree modifications.
Those are done under separate intents and so we have to roll and
commit the defered ops more times on a reflink/rmap based
filesystem. Hence the logcount is higher so that the initial
reservation can roll more times before regrant during a roll has to
go and physically reserve more write space in the log to continue
rolling the transaction.

I don't know if the numbers are correct, and it really is out of
scope for this patch to audit/fix that. I really think we need to
map this whole thing out in a diagram at this point because I now
suspect that the allocfree log count calculation is not correct,
either...

Yeah, I'm not sure if this is correct/needed or not.

Will fix.
