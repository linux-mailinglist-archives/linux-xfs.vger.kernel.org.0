Oh, I'm sorry for the confusion I caused you. And I will reference it
next time.

First of all, there may be ambiguity in the name of the bc_free_longest
field. I'm sorry for that. Its only role is to give the longest non-0 in
a particular scenario.

Yes, nflen1/2 can't determine the subsequent operation, but they are
used to update the longest record only if the numrec in cntbt is zero,
the last has been deleted and a new record will be added soon (that is,
there is still space left on the file system), and that is their only
function. So at this time nflen1/2 are not random extent, they indicate
the maximum value to be inserted later. If cntbt does not need to be
updated longest or the numrec is not zero, then bc_free_longest will not
be used to update the longest.

The logic I'm considering here is that the record is less than or equal
to the maximum value that will be updated soon, as I wrote "potentially"
in the comment. And consider the following two scenarios:
1) If it is no merge, then haveleft == 0 && haveright == 0, and
bc_free_longest will not be assigned, and is no need to worry about the
longest update at this time.
2) If it is in merge scenario, only updating the original values here,
and the actual updates are put into the subsequent xfs_btree_insert().
There is no need to worry about atomicity, both are carried out in the
same transaction. All we have to do is the longest non-0. As long as the
fast path judgment without locking passes, the longest must be updated
to the correct value during the second lock judgment.

I tested this part of the code, passed xfstests, and local validation
found no problems.

I'm sorry, but I didn't find the problem during my own screening. In my 
opinion, because the trigger scenario for the current problem is only to 
delete the last node and be updated shortly, and bc_free_longest is used
only in the following two scenarios:
1) cntbt has only one extent and remains after being used, so nflen 1/2
will be inserted later.
2) cntbt has only one extent and the released extent is adjacent to this
record. This unique record will be deleted firstly, and then the two
extents are merged and inserted.

The above two scenarios are both within the same transaction, and both
are guaranteed by a xfs_buf lock. When run xfs_trans_commit, code have
gone through the delete and insert process, or merge and update process.
So the longest value written to the disk is already the correct value
and matches the cntbt state at this time. In other scenarios, the numrec
of cntbt cannot be 0, so the longest cannot be updated through
bc_free_longest.
