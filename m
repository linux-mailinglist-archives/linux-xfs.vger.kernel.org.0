Yeah, I only did A/B testing of before and after this patch, so it's
quite plausible that it's the lookup that's slowing us down.

"xfile: implement write caching

"Cache a few of the most recently used pages in the hopes of saving
ourselves a few trips through shmem_get_folio_gfp.  There's enough time
savings to shave a few percent off the runtime of fstests with online
fsck enabled."

How about that?  I guess I could modify this patch in djwong-wtf not to
cache kmappings and retest, but that seems like a lot for a patch that
is pretty simple after it goes on a diet. :)
