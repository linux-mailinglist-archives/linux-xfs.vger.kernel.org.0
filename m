Ok, but do we need an up-front quota reservation for freeing blocks out
of the bmapbt? ISTM the reservation could be removed regardless of the
merging behavior. This is what my current patch does, at least, so we'll
see if anything explodes. :P

I agree on the xfs_bmse_merge() bit. I was planning to leave that as is
however because IIRC, even though it is quite rare, I thought we had a
few corner cases where it was possible for physically and logically
contiguous extents to track separately in a mapping tree. Max sized
extents that are subsequently punched out or truncated might be one
example. I thought we had others, but I can't quite put my finger on it
atm..

Thanks. FWIW, I whipped up a few patches to hold ilock across insert and
collapse yesterday that survive cursory testing. I'll get them on the
list after more thorough testing..
