When inode flush failure, the inode item is also removed from the AIL. Since
the inode item has already been added to bp->b_li_list during precommit, it
can be deleted through the error handling xfs_buf_ioend_fail(bp), and this
deletion occurs after the log shutdown. However, during dquot item push,
the dquot item has not yet been attached to the buffer. Therefore, in this
case, the dquot item is directly removed from the AIL.
