Yeah, i can split it up, just wanted to see what people thought
about the approach...

I could, but it still needs to be split over two lines and I find
unnecessarily complex ASSERT checks hinder understanding. I can look
at what I wrote at a glance and immediately understand that the
assert is conditional on the counter being negative, but the single
line compound assert form requires me to stop, read and think about
the logic before I can identify that the ifreedelta check is just a
conditional that reduces the failure scope rather than is a failure
condition itself.

I like simple logic with conditional behaviour being obvious via
pattern matching - it makes my brain hurt less because I'm really
good at visual pattern matching and I'm really bad at reading
and writing code.....

That required writing more code and adding more logic I'd have to
think about to write, and then think about again every time I read
it.

I also thought about that, but all this accounting should have
already been bounds checked. i.e. We should never get an error here,
and I don't think I've *ever* seen an assert in this code fire.
Hence I just went for the dead simple nuke-it-from-orbit patch...

Cheers,

Dave.
