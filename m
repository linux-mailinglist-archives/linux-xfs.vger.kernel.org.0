That shouldn't be happening -- each of the xfs_free_extent_later calls
below adds new incore EFIs to an xfs_defer_pending.dfp_work list and
each xfs_defer_pending itself gets added to xfs_trans.t_dfops.  The
defer_capture_and_commit function will turn the xfs_defer_pending into a
new EFI log item with the queued dfp_work items attached.

IOWs, as long as you don't call xfs_free_extent_later on any of the
xefi_startblock/blockcount pairs where xfs_trans_free_extent returned 0,
your assumptions are correct.

The code presented in this patch is correct.
