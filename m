That's fair. It was more the background task that I was concerned about.
If the issue is that the compression takes too long, ISTM there's a
similar risk of the background compression conflicting with ongoing
tests. E.g., we have various tests that scale out I/O threads to extreme
levels and could delay the compression even longer (or vice versa), we
have no way to prevent multiple background compression tasks from
starting/competing as tests continue to run, etc.

What about allowing the user to specify an optional env var in the
config file to provide a compression command to use? If set, compress
the file in the foreground. Then the user can determine whether
compression is necessary at all, and if so, which compression tool might
provide a suitable enough time/space tradeoff for the test environment
(i.e., something like lz4 might be faster than gzip or bzip2 at the cost
of space).
