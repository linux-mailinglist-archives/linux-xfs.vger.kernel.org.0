There can be things logged while the AIL is pushing, hence by the
time the push waiter is woken and running again the head of the log
could have moved forwards. Hence the second log force is not
indicating that the log is empty because the head and tail aren't in
the same place. Even if you push the AIL after that, this doesn't
guarantee that the tail LSN in the log has moved past the superblock
that is sitting in the log - that requires another log write after
the second AIL push....

i.e. without a log force after the second AIL push, log recovery
will still try to recover anything still active in the journal after
the second log force, including the superblock update, because the
AIL push only updates the log tail in memory, not on disk...

No, it doesn't. But it's empty and has nothing to recover, except
for the dummy superblock which has no actual changes in it...

Yup, that's the gist of it.

Yes, pretty much.

Only I don't think we should be using an unmount record for
this. Looking at what we do with a freeze these days, and how
xfs_log_quiesce() is implemented, I think it's all wrong for
freezing. Freezing does not require us to empty the buffer cache,
and freezing immediately dirties the log again by logging the
superblock after quiesce to ensure recovery will run.

IOWs, what freeze actually needs is the quiesce to return with an
empty but dirty log, and that's exactly what covering the log does.

For changing incompat log flags, covering also provides exactly what
we need - an empty log with only a dirty superblock in the journal
to recover. All that we need then is to recheck feature flags after
recovery (not just clear log incompat flags) because we might need
to use this to also set incompat feature flags dynamically.

Hence it seems to me that what xfs_log_quiesce() should do is cover
the log, and the callers of xfs_log_quiesce() can then write the
unmount record directly if they need a clean log to be left behind.

The emptying of the buffer cache should also be removed from
xfs_log_quiesce(), because the only thing that needs this is
xfs_log_unmount(). Freeze, rw->ro transitions and the new log
incompat flag modifications do not need to empty the buffer cache.

And that leaves us with a xfs_log_quiesce() that can then be used to
modify the superblock during the second phase of the covering
process.

That's kinda what I'd like to see done - it gives us a generic way
of altering superblock incompat feature fields and filesystem
structures dynamically with no risk of log recovery needing to parse
structures it may not know about.

*nod*

That's exactly what I'm trying to acheive here - one mechanism to
rule them all :)
