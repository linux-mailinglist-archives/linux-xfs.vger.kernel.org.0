Runtime corruption detection at the point of error injection already
warns via the XFS_IS_CORRUPT() macro:

	if (XFS_IS_CORRUPT(mp, !xfs_ifork_has_extents(ifp)) ||
	    XFS_TEST_ERROR(false, mp, XFS_ERRTAG_BMAPIFORMAT))
		return -EFSCORRUPTED;

Oops, I'm getting ahead of myself, aren't I? I was looking at a
local review branch that has everything merged in, not the for-next
branch I thought I was looking at...
