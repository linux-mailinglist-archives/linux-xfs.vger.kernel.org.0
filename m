I propose a (somewhat) different solution to this problem:

Port to libxfs the code that determines where mkfs/repair expect the
root inode.  Whenever we want to update the geometry information in the
superblock from mount options, we can test the new ones to see if that
would cause sb_rootino to change.  If there's no change, we update
everything like we do now.  If it would change, either we run with those
parameters incore only (which I think is possible for su/sw?) or refuse
them (because corruption is bad).

This way we don't lose the su/sw updating behavior we have now, and we
also gain the ability to shut down an entire class of accidental sb
geometry corruptions.
