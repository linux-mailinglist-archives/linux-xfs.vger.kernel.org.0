Hi all,

Fuzz testing of the refcount btree demonstrated a weakness in validation
of refcount btree records during normal runtime.  The idea of using the
upper bit of the rc_startblock field to separate the refcount records
into one group for shared space and another for CoW staging extents was
added at the last minute.  The incore struct left this bit encoded in
the upper bit of the startblock field, which makes it all too easy for
arithmetic operations to overflow if we don't detect the cowflag
properly.

When I ran a norepair fuzz tester, I was able to crash the kernel on one
of these accidental overflows by fuzzing a key record in a node block,
which broke lookups.  To fix the problem, make the domain (shared/cow) a
separate field in the incore record.

Unfortunately, a customer also hit this once in production.  Due to bugs
in the kernel running on the VM host, writes to the disk image would
occasionally be lost.  Given sufficient memory pressure on the VM guest,
a refcountbt xfs_buf could be reclaimed and later reloaded from the
stale copy on the virtual disk.  The stale disk contents were a refcount
btree leaf block full of records for the wrong domain, and this caused
an infinite loop in the guest VM.

If you're going to start using this mess, you probably ought to just
pull from my git trees, which are linked below.

This is an extraordinary way to destroy everything.  Enjoy!
Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
