su = 512kB.

Max XFS log stripe unit = 256kB.

It used to emit a warning and set the lsu=32kB, but we decided that
the error message was harmful for automatically calculated values.
I wonder who decided to remove that?

    mkfs: don't warn about log sunit size if it was auto-discovered

    Today, users doing a bare mkfs on storage with a large default
    stripe size may be surprised to get this warning:

     log stripe unit (%d bytes) is too large (maximum is 256KiB
     log stripe unit adjusted to 32KiB

    through no fault of their own.  The fallback is appropriate
    and harmless, and there's no need to warn about this in the
    defaults case.

    However, we keep the warning if a large log stripe unit was
    specified by the user on the commandline.

As for why we drop back to teh default non-stripe aligned value
rather than 32kB now?

Well, 32kB was completely arbitrary, and any non-zero log stripe
unit is known to be detrimental to fsync heavy workloads because all
the iclog padding consumed all the available disk bandwidth rather
than actual data or metadata changes. So lsu=32kB is not necessarily
better than lsu=4kB for storage with large stripe units.

That's especially true now that we only issue flush/FUA operations for
start/commit iclog writes and not for all the intermediate iclogs in
a checkpoint.  Hence iclogs writes will get merged much more often
and optimised by the block layer for RAID stripes regardless of
their alignment.

Whether the change was intentional? Probably not. the stripe unit
code was spaghettied through the mkfs code, and the commit that
cleaned this up:

    mkfs: rework stripe calculations
    
    The data and log stripe calculations a spaghettied all over the mkfs
    code. This patch pulls all of the different chunks of code together
    into calc_stripe_factors() and removes all the redundant/repeated
    checks and calculations that are made.

Appears to have changed this specific case as large sector sizes
now set the default lsunit long before we try to apply the default
stripe aligned value for a filesystem with no specific lsunit being
set.

As much as there may be an unintentional difference here, I'll argue
that the current behaviour has less potential negative effects on
performance than the old one of defaulting to 32kB for such
configurations....

Cheers,

Dave.
