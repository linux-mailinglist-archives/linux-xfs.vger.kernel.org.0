Yeah, that's my question too. I don't know :P that's why I decide to start the
thread with a patch. I also wouldn't expect the alignment requirement to be
bypassed unless we are low in space, but I am not sure if that's correct or not.

Hmm, is this the same case we spoke about?

Yeah, I am a bit confused about it. I need to understand the alloc algorithm to
get a better idea on what's going on. I honestly don't know if the test did its
job or if we should really expect misaligned files if the allocation request
spans more than 1 AG, I should have started the thread with this question :P
