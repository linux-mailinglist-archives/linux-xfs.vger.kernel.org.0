Hmmmm.. but does log covering actually mark the log clean? I was
thinking it did from your description but from a quick test it appears
it does not. Perhaps that's what you mean by "empty" instead of clean,
since the log is not technically empty but it contains a no-op change.

If that's the case, perhaps we can do an explicit log cover in any of
the quiesce paths, as you describe, before logging the unmount record.
The first superblock update is essentially no-op to stamp a new tail in
the log (as is done today), the next logs the actual superblock change
and updates the on-disk tail to point to the just written checkpoint,
then we writeback the superblock and mark the log clean with an unmount
record. On recovery, we either see a dirty log with the superblock bit
set, a dirty log with the superblock bit cleared but that has already
been covered (so is safely recoverable on an old kernel), or a clean
log. Am I following that about right..?
