<nod> I have a few comments about that, but they're all in the PSI
patch. :)

The only other way I can think of is to embed MAX_AIO_EVENTS iocbs in
the buftarg and (I guess) track which ones are free with a bitmap.  That
would cut down the iocb memory overhead to the IOs that we're actually
running at a cost of more bookkeepping and potential starvation issues
for the yuuuge buffer that takes a long time to collect all NR iocbs.

Ow my brain.

Why is it faster to blow out the cache?  Is it the internal overhead of
digging through a huge buftarg hash table to find the buffer that the
caller wants and/or whacking enough of the other stale buffers to free
up memory to avoid the buffer cache limits?

Hm, is Al actually going to review io_uring as he's been threatening to
do?  I'd hold off until that happens, or one of us goes and tests it in
anger to watch all the smoke leak out, etc...

Aha, so yes that answers my question in ... whichever patch that was
somewhere around #17.
