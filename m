I've been looking at 187, and the tests that are failing are testing
the specific behaviour of "mkfs w/attr2 enabled; mount noattr2 and
ensure the attr2 version bits are not set".

Basically, the premise of the noattr2 verification tests are not
valid anymore, but adding filters to mask out the addition of
MOREBITS and ATTR2 basically renders the test useless for validating
the old behaviour is still correct.

IOWs, there's no way to detect if a kernel is going to behave like
the old code and remove the bits, or whether it is going to just
leave the attr2 fields set on disk. Hence I've got no idea how we'd
change xfs/187 to validate both the old and new behaviour because we
have no way of knowing which behaviour to expect.

So I'd vote for just throwing away xfs/187 because a) it looks
unfixable to me, and b) it's trying to validate what should be
considered broken behaviour (i.e. on-disk feature bit gets removed
even though the feature is still present on disk)...

Your thoughts?

Cheers,

Dave.
