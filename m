Gosh, quite a few I think, but I'm not solid on what they all do.  If we 
take a peek at XFS_LI_TYPE_DESC, theres an identifier for each type, to 
give you an idea.  A lot of them do look like they are part of reflink 
operations though.

Great question, this one goes back a ways.  I believe the train of logic 
we had is that because parent pointers also include the filename of the 
parent, its possible we can end up with really big attributes.  Which 
may run into a lot of block map/unmap activity for name space changes. 
We didnt want to end up with overly large transactions in the log, so we 
wanted to break them up by returning -EAGAIN where ever the transactions 
used to be rolled.  I'm pretty sure that covers a quick high level 
history of where we are now?  Did that answer your question?
