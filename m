History. In 2006 this went from being calculated and checked on
every transaction, to just being debug code:

commit a7b0e16180bdc21c42331259b741c86ebd27b9bf
Author: Nathan Scott <nathans@sgi.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 23 02:49:59 2006 +0000

    Reduce size of xfs_trans_t structure.
    * remove ->t_forw, ->t_back -- unused
    * ->t_ag_freeblks_delta, ->t_ag_flist_delta, ->t_ag_btree_delta
      are debugging aid -- wrap them in everyone's favourite way.
    
    As a result, cut "xfs_trans" slab object size from 592 to 572 bytes here.

    Merge of xfs-linux-melb:xfs-kern:26319a by kenmcd.
    
      Reduce size of xfs_trans_t structure.

But the fields are largely unchanged from when they were introduced
in 1994 as a debugging aid:

commit a6116f5f96658a400f122527163d2a233c45904c
Author: Adam Sweeney <ajs@sgi.com>
Date:   Mon Jun 27 23:53:59 1994 +0000

    Add debugging accounting for agf btree blocks.

commit 785055c77c166e935f22afd3379a861e2967a3b1
Author: Adam Sweeney <ajs@sgi.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 24 20:46:39 1994 +0000

    Add calls to track agf counter changes in the transaction
    so we can ensure that they are consistent with the changes
    to the superblock.

So it was debugging code from 1994 that was largely turned into dead
code when lazysbcounters were introduced in 2007. Hence I'm not sure
it holds any value anymore, especially if we are just going to turn
lazycount for everyone...

Cheers,

Dave.
