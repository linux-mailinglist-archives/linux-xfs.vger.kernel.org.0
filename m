Thanks for this information!

I understand that the "fixes" are not needed, but the moto of the stable
tree maintainers is that taking harmless patches is preferred over non
clean backports and without those patches, the rest of the series does
not apply cleanly.

So the question is: does it hurt to take those patches to the stable tree?

Well the test does not fail so it doesn't hurt either. Right?
In my test env, we will occasionally pull latest fstests and then
the unneeded test will be removed.

Does that sound right?

Thanks,
Amir.
