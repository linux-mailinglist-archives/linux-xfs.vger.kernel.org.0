Hm, trying to parse that...

Would it be correct to restate your last sentence as "Disallowing reflink
when XFS_DIFLAG2_DAX is set and dax=inode is set makes sense?"

If so, then the only change you're suggesting to this patch is to /allow/
reflinking if dax=never is set?

I just figured a very clear statementa bout incompatible flags was simplest,
but I get it that it's overly restrictive, functionally.

Thanks,
