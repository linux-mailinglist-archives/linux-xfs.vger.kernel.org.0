I don't understand.  We are in the inner loop and under l_icloglock.
The next time a shutdown can come in is when
xlog_state_do_iclog_callbacks drops l_icloglock.  That is at the end
of the inner loop, which means we will always go back to the
force shutdown check quickly.  So how is the branch duplicate?  Yes,
it also calls xlog_state_do_iclog_callbacks and does the wakeup,
but in doing that early it avoid a whole lot of complicated logic
in the previous code base.

I'm rather confused now.

What shutdown check associated with CALLBACK?

True, actually running callbacks on various kinds of "in-flight" iclogs
seems rather dangerous.  So should I interpret your above comments
in that we should fix that first before killing of the IOERROR state?
