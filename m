Hi Eric,

We use SSDs from multiple vendors that can be configured at power-on (via
GPIO) to be read-write or write-protected. When write-protected we get I/O
errors for any writes that reach the device. We believe that behavior is
correct.

We have found that XFS fails during log recovery even when the log is clean
(apparently due to metadata writes immediately before actual recovery).
Vincent and I believe that mounting read-only without recovery should be
fine even when the log is not clean, since the filesystem will be consistent,
even if out-of-date.

Our customers' use often requires nonvolatile memory to be write-protected
or not based on the device being installed in a development or deployed
system. It is ideal for them to be able to mount their filesystems read-
write when possible and read-only when not without having to alter mount
options.

Aaron
