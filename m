Ok, that doesn't contain inodes. It's not even recognisable
as filesystem metadata at all.

Log recovery covers anything that changed in the filesystem - it has
nothing to do with what is being accessed by boot operations.

'mount -o ro,norecovery <dev>' will allow you to skip log recovery
and hopefully let you navigate the filesystem. It will not be error
free, though, because log recovery is needed for that to occur.

If the filesystem looks mostly intact, copy all the data off it you
can. Then unmount it is and run xfs_repair -L <dev> on it to blow
away the log and repair any corruption found. This will cause data
loss, so don't do this unless you are prepared for it of have a
complete copy of the broken filesystem.

I'd highly recommend doing this with a recent xfs_repair, not the
tools that came with CentOS 6.

You could also do dry-run testing by taking a metadump of the broken
filesystem and restoring that to an image file and running reapir on
that image file. That will at least tell you how much of the
directory structure will be trashed and wht you'll be able to access
after repair.

It may be that mounting w/ norecovery is your best bet of recovering
the contents of the bad filesystems, so do that first...

Cheers,

Dave.
