Where's the NOFS allocation coming from?

This looks mostly fine to me aside from an interface nit. I find it
strange that we need to specify a max value in len for an xattr of
unknown length. Even if we wanted to provide the caller the option to
specify a max, I think we should be able to pass zero here and not fail
with -ERANGE down in xfs_attr_copy_value(). Of course, we can and should
still check the on-disk value length (against XFS_XATTR_SIZE_MAX for
example) to protect against overtly large allocation attempts if on-disk
data happens to bogus.

Somewhat related on the interface topic... should we ever return an
allocated buffer on error, or should the xattr layer unwind such
operations before it returns? This patch handles the value buffer fine
from a functional perspective, but the latter seems more consistent with
our general design practice. A future ATTR_ALLOC caller might not know
to free args.value unconditionally (and as a reviewer I probably
wouldn't expect it).
