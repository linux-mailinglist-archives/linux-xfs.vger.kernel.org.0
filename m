That doesn't mean it's perfect and can't be changed, nor that I
remember the exact details of something that happened 6 months ago.
Indeed, if I'm confused by it 6 months later, that tends to say it
wasn't a very good name... :)

.... or that the missing context needs explaining so the reader is
reminded what the _ondisk() name means.

i.e. the problem goes away with a simple comment:

/*
 * Calculate the maximum possible height of the btree that the
 * on-disk format supports. This is used for sizing structures large
 * enough to support every possible configuration of a filesystem
 * that might get mounted.
 */

Cheers,

Dave.
