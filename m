Sure, lets take a look at fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_defer.c line 399
We have the callback invocation:
error = ops->finish_item(*tp, li, dfp->dfp_done, &state);

This is where the intent items get to finish out their operations.  If 
they return -EAGAIN, they get get put back in the list, but if they 
error out, we jump to the error handler (line 445), where we abort the 
transaction and do a shutdown.


Now, if we peek ahead at the first patch that belongs to the next 
delayed attribute series:

https://github.com/allisonhenderson/xfs_work/commit/7d5b7395fe3b1df7739089c0643e20b09de2e0b0

If you expand the diff for fs/xfs/xfs_attr_item.c, and zip down to line 
269, you'll see a ".finish_item	= xfs_attr_finish_item".  This callback 
will do some leg work to unwrap the log item and feed the appropriate 
parameters back into xfs_attr_set_iter.  So this is why we go through 
all the trouble to check for any expected errors ahead of time.

Well, the idea is to avoid that with this helper function.  Reading 
ahead, it looks like you've already connected the two :-)

Yes, we do that later in the set, but I think you've got it ;-)
