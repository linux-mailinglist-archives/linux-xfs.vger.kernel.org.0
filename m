I was thinking more about cases where there are actually no inodes
attached.

Right. That's indicative from the code, but doesn't help me understand
why the change is made. That's all I'm asking for...

Ok, interesting (but seems beyond the scope of this series).

That's a rather vague hint. ;P I was more hoping for something like:
"While this is largely a refactor of existing functionality, broaden the
scope of the flag to beyond where inodes are explicitly attached because
<some actual reason>. This has the effect of possibly invoking the
callback in cases where it wouldn't have been previously, but this is
not a functional change because the callback is effectively a no-op when
inodes are not attached."
