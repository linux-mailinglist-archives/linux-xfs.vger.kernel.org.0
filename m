It's not exactly dirty, though.  It's 'present' (ie the opposite
of hole).  I'm not attached to the name.  So it can be used to
implement iomap_is_partially_uptodate.  If the page is dirty, the chunks
corresponding to the present bits get written back, but we don't track
a per-block dirty state.

iomap_set_page_dirty() is called from iomap_page_mkwrite_actor(), so
sure!

I don't want to get it confused with page states.  This is a different
thing.  It's just tracking which blocks are holes (and have definitely
not been written to), so those blocks can remain as holes when the page
gets written back.
