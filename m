Yep, that's correct.  I guess I should have (re)written the commit
message like this:

"When we're checking the rmap and refcount btrees, push error reporting
down to the exact locations of failures so that the user sees both a
message specific to the failure that occurred and what repair was doing
at the time.  This also removes quite a bit of return code handling,
since all the errors were fatal anyway."
