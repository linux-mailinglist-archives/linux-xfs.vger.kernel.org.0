Hi Chandan,

Please pull this branch with changes for xfs for 6.6-rc1.

As usual, I did a test-merge with the main upstream branch as of a few
minutes ago, and didn't see any conflicts.  Please let me know if you
encounter any problems.

xfs: allow the user to cancel repairs before we start writing (2023-08-10 07:48:10 -0700)

xfs: miscellaneous repair tweaks [v26.1]

Before we start adding online repair functionality, there's a few tweaks
that I'd like to make to the common repair code.  First is a fix to the
integration between repair and the health status code that was
interfering with repair re-evaluations.  Second is a minor tweak to the
sole existing repair functions to make one last check that the user
hasn't terminated the calling process before we start writing to the
filesystem.  This is a pattern that will repeat throughout the rest of
the repair functions.

This has been running on the djcloud for years with no problems.  Enjoy!
