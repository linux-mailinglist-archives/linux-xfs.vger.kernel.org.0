Yeah.. I've got an experiment running that essentially tracks pending
inode grace period cookies and attempts to avoid them at allocation
time. It's crude atm, but the initial numbers I see aren't that far off
from the results produced by your expedited grace period mechanism. I
see numbers mostly in the 40-50k cycles per second ballpark. This is
somewhat expected because the current baseline behavior relies on unsafe
reuse of inodes before a grace period has elapsed. We have to rely on
more physical allocations to get around this, so the small batch
alloc/free patterns simply won't be able to spin as fast. The difference
I do see with this sort of explicit gp tracking is that the results
remain much closer to the baseline kernel when background activity is
ramped up.

However, one of the things I'd like to experiment with is whether the
combination of this approach and expedited grace periods provides any
sort of opportunity for further optimization. For example, if we can
identify that a grace period has elapsed between the time of
->destroy_inode() and when the queue processing ultimately marks the
inode reclaimable, that might allow for some optimized allocation
behavior. I see this occur occasionally with normal grace periods, but
not quite frequent enough to make a difference.

What I observe right now is that the same test above runs at much closer
to the baseline numbers when using the ikeep mount option, so I may need
to look into ways to mitigate the chunk allocation overhead..
