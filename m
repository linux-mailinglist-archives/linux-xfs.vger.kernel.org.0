Oh, I see. I noticed that querying the missing_owner range could be
precise, but querying the non-missing_owner range only displayed the
whole thing. I found this inconsistent, so I fixed the issue myself...

I'm very sorry, I mistakenly referred to "end_daddr" as "tail_daddr"!
"end_daddr" is mainly used to fix the first bug, where the last range
wasn't calculated with sector granularity, causing query issues. The
second bug fix relies on both "start_daddr" and "end_daddr". But as
discussed above, the second one isn't really an issue? So I'll only fix
the first bug in the next patch version.

Thanks,
