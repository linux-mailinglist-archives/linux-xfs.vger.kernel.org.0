Good question, and I don't know.

In general, we've always said that an aborted repair should leave things
in a not-worse state, I think? As in "repair is safe to cancel?"

I don't know if that holds true on an upgrade path though...

The /forcefsck is already honored, so I think the only additional possible
pitfalls would be specifically related to the upgrade path.

But, that upgrade path would encourage more people to make use of it, so...

I guess in general, if we honor forcefsck and translate that into a real
xfs_repair run, it probably makes sense to honor command line options in
general.
