At this point in the attr process, if this error happens, I would call it "a programming mistake" of sorts.  This condition of the attr already existing is handled much earlier in the code, so this error code path really shouldn't ever execute at this point unless something weird happened.

No worries, thanks for the feed back.  Ok, will send out a v2.
