Yes, I'm not particularly concerned about whether buffered I/O is 
atomic. I'm more concerned about the multithreading performance of 
buffered I/O.

Last week, it was mentioned that removing i_rwsem would have some 
impacts on truncate, fallocate, and PNFS operations.

(I'm not familiar with pNFS, so please correct me if I'm wrong.)

My understanding is that the current i_rwsem is used to protect both
the file's data and its size. Operations like truncate, fallocate,
and PNFS use i_rwsem because they modify both the file's data and its 
size. So, I'm thinking whether it's possible to use i_rwsem to protect 
only the file's size, without protecting the file's data.

So operations that modify the file's size need to be executed 
sequentially. For example, buffered writes to the EOF, fallocate 
operations without the "keep size" requirement, and truncate operations, 
etc, all need to hold an exclusive lock.

Other operations require a shared lock because they only need to access
the file's size without modifying it.

Sorry, I overlooked some details from old discussion last time.
It seems that you are not satisfied with the effectiveness of
range locks.
