I don't want xfile_dump to invoke direct reclaim which will then call
back into xfs because scrub (or any xfile caller) might already be
holding the an ILOCK.

Granted it's /probably/ redundant since the scrub transaction will have
already memalloc_nofs_save'd.  But as this is a debug function, I
figured it was better to burn an unsigned long to prevent making
problems worse...

I think that's an omission.

Heh.  Yeah, I really wish xfiles had been merged before you started the
folioization instead of adding to legacy code creeping.

Hehhehee yep.
