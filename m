Hey Darrick, on a slightly different topic, you had mentioned on last
week's ext4 video chat that you had been working on some patches to
allow specific blocks to be forced to return EIO, at specific times,
to test how a file system handles errors when writing to data blocks,
metadata blocks, journal, etc.

Are there early versions of those patches available for us to play
with?  I'm interesting in using that infrastructure for adding some
ext4 tests along those lines.

Thanks!!
