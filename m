I don't want to tear into the implementation details of rwsems if I can
avoid it.  Just because we all have one big happy address space doesn't
mean shortcuts won't hose everyone.

Pavel Reichl tried that two months ago in:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20201102194135.174806-2-preichl@redhat.com/

which resulted in fstests regressions:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20201104005345.GC7115@magnolia/

TLDR: the ILOCK semaphore is data-centric, but lockdep's debugging
chains are task-centric, which causes incorrect lock validation reports.

The solutions as I see them are: (a) figure out if we really still need
to defer bmbt splits to workers to avoid overflowing the kernel stack;
or (b) making it possible to transfer rwsem ownership to shut up
lockdep; or (c) fix the is_held predicate to ignore ownership.
