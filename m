For this patch - nothing. It just maintains the consistency
introduced in the previous patch of doing the CIL context updates
under the xc_push_lock. I did that in the previous patch for
simplicity: the next patch adds the start record ordering which,
like the commit record ordering, needs to set ctx->start_lsn and run
the waiter wakeup under the xc_push_lock.

I think it's better to document calling conventions at the top of
the function, rather than having to read the implementation of the
function to determine how it is supposed to be called. i.e. we
expect two calls to this function per CIL checkpoint - the first for
the start record ordering, the second for the commit record
ordering...

Cheers,

Dave.
