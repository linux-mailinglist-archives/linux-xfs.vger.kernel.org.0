<nod> Linus' fixup stuffs the seq value in tv_sec.  That's not great
since the inode writeout code then truncates the upper 32 bits, but
that's what the kernel has been doing for 5+ years now.

Dave suggested that we might restore the pre-4.6 behavior by explicitly
encoding what we used to do:

	inode->i_atime.tv_sec = seq & 0xFFFFFFFF;
	inode->i_atime.tv_nsec = seq >> 32;

(There's a helper in 6.7 for this, apparently.)

But then I pointed out that the entire rtpick sequence counter thing
merely provides a *starting point* for rtbitmap searches.  So it's not
like garbled values result in metadata inconsistency.  IOWs, it's
apparently benign.

IOWs, how much does anyone care about improving on Linus' fixup?
