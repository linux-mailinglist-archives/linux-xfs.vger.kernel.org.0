To prevent old kernels from tripping over our new strategy.

Images generated by old kernels would be fine.

The simple reason is that the current xfs_iunlink() code only generates
unlinked list in the new way but no multiple buckets. So, we must have
a choice for V4 since it's still supported by the current kernel:

 1) add some feature to entirely refuse new v4 images on older kernels;
 2) allow speculate matching so older kernel would bail out as fs corruption
    (but I have no idea if it has any harm);

hmmm... not quite get the point though.
For this specific patch, I think it'll be folded into some patch or
rearranged.

It should not be a followed-up patch (we must do some decision in advance
 -- whether or not add this feature).

hmmm... xfs_sync_sb in xfs_mountfs() will generate a sb transaction,
right? I don't get the risk here.

As I said above, new xfs_iunlink() doesn't support multiple buckets
anymore (just support it for log recovery). So this feature would be
needed.

If supporting old multiple buckets xfs_iunlink() is needed, that's
a quite large modification of this entire patchset.
