Does this change to flush the log after committing the new sb fix the
recovery problems on older kernels?  I /think/ that's the point of this
patch.

Ugh.  I've recently noticed the long soak logrecovery test vm have seen
a slight tick up in failure rates -- random blocks that have clearly had
garbage written to them such that recovery tries to read the block to
recover a buffer log item and kaboom.  At this point it's unclear if
that's a problem with xfs or somewhere else. :(

I'm curious, what might break?  Was that merely a general comment, or do
you have something specific in mind?  (iows: do you see more string to
pull? :))

Yeah, it's too bad there's no good way to test recovery with older
kernels either. :(
