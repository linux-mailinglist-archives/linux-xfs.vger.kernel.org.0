There are 3-value relationships now (rhead->h_len <= rhead->h_size <=
unique allocated buffer size [which is the same as rhead->h_size of
initial tail log record]).

The only buffer overrun case which could do harm runtimely is
rhead->h_len > bufsize as I mentioned in the previous email
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200902224726.GB4671@xiangao.remote.csb

so I guess what you meant is

 - get h_size from the tail initial log record as buffer size (so
   workaround needs to be settled here as well);
 - call in xlog_valid_rec_header() to fail out rhead->h_len >
   buffer size.

as the 1st splited patch. Yet that's not the case of Item #2
(rhead->h_size <= buffer size), just to confirm if my understanding
is correct.

based on the words above, my understanding is that the 2nd spilted
patch is used to do such extra check in xlog_valid_rec_header() to

check buffer size == rhead->h_size all the time?

so the relationship would be rhead->h_len <= buffer size = rhead->h_size.

please correct me if I'm wrong since I'm a bit confusing about some
English expressions. Yeah, if my understanding is correct, I'd like
to hear if this 2nd spilted check patch is needed (it won't
cause any stability impact since rhead->h_size for log records
other than tail record isn't useful due to the current logic...)
