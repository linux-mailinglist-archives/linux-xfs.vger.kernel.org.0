Yeah, that was my question, too.

WHile I'm here, Chandan, a small patch admin note: tools like b4
don't handle patch versions like "V1.1" properly.

If you are replying in line with a new patch, just call it "V2" or
"V3" - the version of the entire patchset (in the [PATCH 0/N V2]
header) doesn't matter in this case, what matters is that it the
second version of the patch in this thread. Us humans are smart
enough to tell the difference between "series version" and "patch
within series version", and it turns out if you use the right
version formats the tools are smart enough, too. :)

As such, b4 will automatically pick up the V2 patch as a newer
version of the patch in the current series rather than miss it
entirely because it doesn't understand the V1.1 version numbering
you've used...

Cheers,

Dave.
