Well I'm not totally convinced the second check is really needed (for
the reasons you mentioned), so this was just an idea of something I
think might be more acceptable than the current approach. The idea was
just to make the validation ensure that h_size is the same across all
log records and it would be completely indepedendent from the mkfs
workaround and the h_len <= bufsize check.
