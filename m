Personally, I think you should push this whenever it's ready.  Are you
aiming to send all 24 patches as a treewide pull request directly to
Linus, or would you rather the 2-3 xfs patches go through the xfs tree?

The y2038 format changes are going to take a while to push through
review.  If somehow it all gets through review for 5.6 I can always
apply both and fix the merge damage, but more likely y2038 timestamps is
a <cough> 5.8 EXPERIMENTAL thing.

Or later, given that Dave and I both have years worth of unreviewed
patch backlog. :(
