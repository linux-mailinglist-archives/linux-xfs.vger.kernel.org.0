A note while it's still fresh in my mind: memory reclaim is going to
force relogging of items whether they need it or not. The inode
shrinker pushes the AIL to it's highest current LSN, which means the
first shrinker invocation will relog the items. Sustained memory
pressure will result in this sort of behaviour

	AIL				AIL relog workqueue
cycle 1:
	relog item
		-> move to relog queue
	relog item
		-> move to relog queue
	....
	relog item
		-> move to relog queue

	queue work to AIL relog workqueue
	<sleep 20ms>

					iterates relog items
					  ->relog
					  commit

cycle 2:
	relog item
		already queued
		marks AIL for log force
	relog item
		already queued
		marks AIL for log force
	....
	relog item
		-> move to relog queue

	<sleep 20ms>

cycle 3:
	xfs_log_force(XFS_LOG_SYNC)
	-> CIL flush
	   log io
	   log IO completes
	   relogged items reinserted in AIL
	....
	relog item
		-> move to relog queue
	relog item
		-> move to relog queue
	....
	relog item
		-> move to relog queue

	queue work to AIL relog workqueue
	<sleep 20ms>

					iterates relog items
					  ->relog
					  commit
<repeat>

So it looks like when there is memory pressure we are going to
trigger a relog every second AIL push cycle, and a synchronous log
force every other log cycle.

Cheers,

Dave.
