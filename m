TLDR: SWAPEXT might work for atomic file content swaps, but I haven't
done the work to ensure that it always does, and I don't think anyone
else has.  FIEXCHANGE (without NONATOMIC) will; that's where all my QA
effort has been focused.

SWAPEXT doesn't guarantee atomicity of the extents swapped.  It might
survive an unexpected crash if you have do not have reverse mapping
enabled on the filesystem /and/ mount with -o wsync.

But keep in mind that all the SWAPEXT fstests (until recently) only
checked that fsr works ok, and fsr calls the kernel with two files that
have identical contents.  Also, as you note below, SWAPEXT refuses to
run if the fdtmp has more extents than fdtarget, which makes it doubly
unsuitable for atomic file commits since ... reversing the order of the
fds and retrying is kinda gross.

FIEXCHANGE adds the necessary logging support and removes all those
restrictions so that it /can/ be used for atomic file data commits, in
more or less the sequence you lay out below.  I'll evaluate your steps
as if you were asking about FIEXCHANGE. ;)

Yes, the kernel locks and flushes both files once you issue the
FIEXCHANGE call.

Either's fine, FIEXCHANGE operate on file descriptors, not paths.

FIEXCHANGE flushes both files for you after taking the kernel locks.

No need for #7, FIEXCHANGE isn't like FIDEDUPERANGE where there's an
implied direction.

It's not guaranteed to be crash atomic at all, and I don't want to
expand the support scope of an ioctl that will soon be part of the
legacy API.

Everyone else please focus on getting FIEXCHANGE reviewed so we can
merge that to upstream.
