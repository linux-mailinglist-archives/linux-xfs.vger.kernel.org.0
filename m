Can we reach down into the transaction's xlog_ticket.t_cnt to find out
how many were left?

Hm.  Maybe that doesn't matter, seeing as recovery basically
single-steps through whatever it salvaged from the log, I think it's
better for recovery to regrant every time it rolls the transaction
because the amount of space required for a single step will (once we get
the logres part sorted out) never be larger than the sum of the logres
of all transactions that were running when we crashed.

It also occurs to me (esp. given the earlier conversation about the
transaction reservations used to recover intents) that in general we
might need to finish one item to push the tail forward to free up space,
so therefore log recovery should try to use as few resources as
possible.

Well, I'll try hardcoding logcount=1 and see what happens. :)
