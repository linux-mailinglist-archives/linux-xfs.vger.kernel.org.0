since we have this check already in xfs_validate_stripe_geometry, it seems best to
keep using it there, and not copy it ... which I think you accomplish below.

Just thinking through this... I think this is the right idea.

dsu is in bytes; this would mean big_dswidth is now also in bytes...
the original goal here, I think, is to not overflow the 32-bit superblock value
for dswidth.

so this used to test big_dswidth in BB (sectors); but now it tests in bytes.

Perhaps this should change to check and report sectors again:

  		if (BTOBBT(big_dswidth) > INT_MAX) {
  			fprintf(stderr,
  _("data stripe width (%lld) is too large of a multiple of the data stripe unit (%d)\n"),
  				BTOBBT(big_dswidth), dsunit);

I think the goal is to not overflow the 32-bit on-disk values, which would be
easy to do with "dsw" specified as a /multiplier/ of "dsu"

So I think that if we keep range checking the value in BB units, it will be
OK.

Otherwise this looks reasonable to me; now it's basically:

1) If we got geometry in bytes, validate them directly
2) If we got geometry in BB, convert to bytes, and validate
3) If we got no geometry, validate the device-reported defaults
