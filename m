Sure we can. We do this sort of "was the mount option set" detection
with m_logbufs and m_logbsize by initialising them to -1. Hence if
they are set by mount options, they'll have a valid, in-range value
instead of "-1".

That said, if you want users passing in sunit=0,swidth=0 to
correctly override existing on-disk values (i.e. effectively mean -o
noalign), then you are going to need to modify
xfs_update_alignment() and xfs_validate_new_dalign() to handle
mp->m_dalign == 0 as a valid value instead of "sunit/swidth mount
option not set, use existing superblock values".....

IOWs, there are deeper changes needed here than just setting a new
flag to say "mount option was set" for it to function correctly and
consistently as you intend. This is why I think we should just fix
this situation automatically, and not require the user to manually
override the bad values.

Thinking bigger picture, I'd like to see the mount options
deprecated and new xfs_admin options added to change the values on a
live, mounted filesystem. That way users who have issues like this
don't need to unmount the filesystem to fix it, not to mention users
who reshape online raid arrays and grow the filesystem can also
change the filesystem geometry without needing to take the
filesystem offline...

Cheers,

Dave.
