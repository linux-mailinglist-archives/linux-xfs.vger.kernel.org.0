It's caused by Christoph's xfs conversion patch as he's changing the one
place where "mp" was passed outside the BROKEN_X86_ALIGNMENT ifdef to a
struct file as arg. So I'd just apply it on top of that if you don't
mind. Would make it easier for Stephen Rothwell too as he's dealing with
all the merge conflicts. :)
