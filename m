OH.  I missed (and you pointed out below) the subtlety that step 3 gives
us a fresh transaction /and/ a fresh EFI, so after the roll, (3/Y) is
the "first" EFI and never has to wait.

So even if the log is being slow and the CIL hasn't cleared the busy
extent (3/X) by the time we finish rolling the tx and relogging the EFI,
the relogged EFI will start with (3/Y) and move forward without waiting.
Got it.

Oh, ok.  I missed that.

<nod> So in other words, the pag_nr_pending_extents counter buys us the
performance advantage that we don't need to add the extra roll between
(3/X) and (3/Y) if the log is running fast enough to clear the busy
extent before we even start evaluating the relogged EFI (with 3/Y in
it).

How often does it happen that we have to roll the transaction and relog
the EFI?

Yes.

Ok, I'll go reread all that.
