Yes, the idea is that EEXIST and ENOATTR are supposed to be found and 
returned by the xfs_has_attr routine above. If they happen at this 
point, it would actually be more of an internal error.  For example: if 
we're renaming an attr, and xfs_has_attr finds that it exists, but then 
xfs_attr_set_args comes back with ENOATTR, clearly something unexpected 
happened.

The motivation for this is just that if it does happen, it's easier to 
work out this out now rather than later when we bring in the rest of the 
delayed attribute code.  Because in that case, the error wont happen 
here, it will happen later as part of a finish_item (or a log replay).

It's not a requirement I suppose, just more of a pro-active check really.

Did that answer your question then?
