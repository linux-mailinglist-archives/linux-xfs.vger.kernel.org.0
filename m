I can't trigger any failures with the fixes I committed, so that's a bit
puzzling. What storage are you running this on? I'll try a few other
things.

Let's turn down the condescension and assumptions a notch, please. The
fio io_uring engine was originally written to benchmark it, and I
haven't really been using it for verification purposes (as is evident).
In my experience, I get much better validation from running internal
production. And plenty of that has been done.

That said, the fio side should of course work, since others can't
necessarily run what I'm running, and it does provide ways to exercise
it that aren't necessarily seen in prod. But blankly assuming that
"nobody ran data validation tests on this shiny new code" is blatantly
false.
