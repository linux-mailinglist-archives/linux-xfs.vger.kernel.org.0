Without refactoring the code that adds reclaim_state->reclaimed to
scan_control->nr_reclaimed into a helper (flush_reclaim_state()), the
change would need to be done in two places instead of one, and I
wouldn't know where to put the huge comment.

One thing that I can do is break down patch 2 into two patches, one
that adds the flush_reclaim_state() helper, and one that adds the
mm_account_reclaimed_pages() helper.

The series would be:
Patch 1: move set_task_reclaim_state() near other helpers
Patch 2: introduce mm_account_reclaimed_pages()
Patch 3: introduce flush_reclaim_state()
Patch 4: add the one-line change (and the huge comment) to flush_reclaim_st=
ate()

Backports need only to take patches 3 & 4 (which would be localized to
mm/vmscan.c), as patches 1 & 2 would be purely cosmetic with no
dependency from patches 3 & 4. For the current series, patch 1 is not
needed anyway. So this change would basically save backporters the
part of patch 2 that is outside of mm/vmscan.c.

If you think this would be useful I can send a v5 with patch 2 broken
down into two patches.
