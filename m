This puts me in a difficult spot.  We're past -rc6, which means that
Linus could tag 5.13.0 tomorrow, and if he does that, whatever's in
for-next needs to have had at least a few days to soak before Linus will
want to pull it upstream.

Or this could be yet another one of those crazy kernels that goes all
the way to -rc8, in which case there's still time to make small
adjustments.  But who knows, I have no schedule visibility.

However, this doesn't sound like small adjustments.  I think it's best
that I withdraw the CIL changes from for-next until we have more time to
fix these issues and make sure that there aren't any bugs that are
easily found by developers.  I feel confident enough about everything
between "xfs: log stripe roundoff is a property of the log" and
"xfs: xfs_log_force_lsn isn't passed a LSN" to keep them in for-next.

I'll also throw in the random fixes that got reviewed this week.
