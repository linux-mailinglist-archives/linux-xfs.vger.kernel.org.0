Because for one, it's not reliable or consistent. A loop device and its backing
file are on the same storage, of course. We get different answers when we try to
query one vs the other via the ioctl, currently.

And for two, the actual access patterns and behavior or writing to a loopback
file aren't really the same as either flavor of block device any way, right?

Now suppose you're creating it for deployment on rotating storage, instead.

My point is if the admin is making an image file, mkfs.xfs has absolutely
no idea where that image will be deployed. The administrator might, and 
could explicitly set parameters as needed based on that knowledge.

Of course...?

I read #2 as "make sure the system you run mkfs on has the same CPU count
as any system you'll deploy that image on" and that's not possible for
a generic image destined for wide deployment into varied environments.

rotationality is pretty trivial and is almost always "not rotational" so
that's not really my major concern. My concern is how CPU count affects
geometry now, by default, once nonrotationality has been determined.

For example if there's some fleet of machines used to produce
an OS and its images, the images may vary depending on which build machine
the image build task lands on unless they all have exactly the same CPU
count. Or say you build for ppc64, aarch64, and x86_64. By default, you're
almost guaranteed to get different fs geometry for each. I just think that's
odd and unexpected. (I understand that it can be overridden but this is
nothing anyone likely expects to be necessary.)

I agree that it makes sense to optimize for nonrotationality more than we
have in the past, by default, for image files. I totally get your point about
how 4 AGs is an optimization for the old world.

So I think my rambling boils down to a few things:

1) mkfsing a file-backed image should be consistent whether you access
   it through a loop device or you open the file directly. That's not
   currently the case.

2) When you are a mkfsing a file-backed image instead of a block device,
   that's a big hint that the filesystem is destined for use on other
   machines, about which mkfs.xfs knows nothing.

3) To meet in the middle, rather than falling back to the old rotational
   behavior of 4 AGs for image files, maybe a new image-file-specific
   heuristic of "more AGs than before, but not scaled by local CPU count"
   would be reasonable. This would make image file generation yield
   consistent and repeatable geometries, by default.
