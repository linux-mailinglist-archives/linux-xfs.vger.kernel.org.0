Likely because the whole BLI lifecycle is completely screwed up and
nobody has had the time to understand it fully and fix it properly.

Actually, after we've dropped the bli reference, it isn't safe to
reference the bli unless we know the buffer is stale. In this case,
we know the bli still exists because the buffer has been locked
since it was marked stale. However, for the other cases the BLI
could be freed from under us as it's reference count is zero and so
the next call to xfs_buf_item_relse() will free it no matter where
it comes from.

The reference counting around BLIs a total mess - this patch just
gets rid of one landmine but there's still plenty more in this code
that need to be untangled.
