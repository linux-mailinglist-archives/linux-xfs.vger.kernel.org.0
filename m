That is correct. I don't think it actually matters because we can't
remove an item that is locked and being relogged (so it's
reservation is in use). Except for the fact we can't serialise
internal itcket accounting updates the transaction might be doing
with external tciket accounting modifications any other way.

Yes, I can see that would be an issue - very well spotted, Brian.

Without reading your further comments: off the top of my head that
means we would probably have to declare particular types of objects
as reloggable, and explicitly include that object in each
reservation rather than use a generic "buffer" or "inode"
reservation for it. We are likely to only be relogging "container"
objects such as intents or high level structures such as,
inodes, AG headers, etc, so this probably isn't a huge increase
in transaction size or complexity, and it will be largely self
documenting.

But cwit still adds more complexity, and we're trying to avoid that
....

.....

Oh, I'm a bit stupid only half way through my first coffee: just get
rid of delta updates altogether and steal the entire relog
reservation for the object up front.  We really don't need delta
updates, it was just something the CIL does so I didn't think past
"we can use that because it is already there"....

/me reads on...

Yep, I think we've both come to the same conclusion :)

Absolutely. I don't think we'll ever need anything more dynamic
or complex. And I think just taking the whole reservation will scale
a lot better if we are constantly modifying the object - we only
need to take the relog lock when we add or remove a relog
reservation now, not on every delta change to the object....

Again, well spotted and good thinking!

Cheers,

Dave.
