We ran XFS for 15+ years without setting current->journal_info, so I
don't see it as a necessary feature...

I could just leave the ASSERT(current->journal_info == NULL); in
xfs_trans_set_context() and we would catch that case. But, really,
having a page fault from some other filesystem bounce into XFS where
we then have to run a transaction isn't a bug at all.

The problem is purely that we now have two different contexts that
now think they own current->journal_info. IOWs, no filesystem can 
allow page faults while current->journal_info is set by the
filesystem because the page fault processing might use
current->journal_info itself.

If we end up with nested XFS transactions from a page fault whilst
holding an empty transaction, then it isn't an issue as the outer
transaction does not hold a log reservation. The only problem that
might occur is a deadlock if the page fault tries to take the same
locks the upper context holds, but that's not a problem that setting
current->journal_info would solve, anyway...

Hence if XFS doesn't use current->journal_info, then we just don't
care what context we are running the transaction in, above or below
the fault.

That's exactly the problem we're trying to avoid. Either we don't
allow faults in (empty) transaction context, or we don't use
current->journal_info. I prefer the latter as it gives us much more
implementation freedom with empty transaction contexts..
