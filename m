All of these cases will a dirty transaction - the inode has been
modified in memory before it was logged and hence we cannot undo
what has already been done. If we return an error here, we will need
to cancel the transaction, and xfs_trans_cancel() will do a shutdown
anyway. Doing it here just means we don't have to return an error
and add error handling to the ~80 callers of xfs_trans_log_inode()
just to trigger a shutdown correctly.

Hmmm. Good question. 

There may be no other inodes on the buffer and it this inode may not
be in the AIL, so there's no trigger for xfs_iflush_abort() to be
run from buffer IO completion. So, yes, we could leave an inode
attached to the buffer here....

Yes, that's where this shutdown race condition has always been
handled. i.e. we know that inodes that are dirty in memory can be
left dangling by the shutdown, and if it's a log IO error they may
even still be pinned. Hence reclaim has to ensure that they are
properly aborted before reclaim otherwise various "reclaiming dirty
inode" asserts will fire.

As it is, in the next patchset the cluster buffer is always inserted
into the AIL as an ordered buffer so it is always committed in the
same transaction as the inode. Hence the abort/unpin call on the
buffer runs the inode IO done processing, it will get removed from
the list and we aren't directly reliant on inode reclaim running a
flush abort to do that for us.

I think I've probably just put the comment and this check in the
wrong patch when I split this all up. A later patch in the series
moves the inode attachment to the buffer to the
xfs_trans_log_inode() call, and that's when this situation arises
and the check is needed.

I think I added that here when debugging an issue as a mechanism
to check that the flush_lsn was only set while a flush was in
progress. It's all hazy now because I had to rebase the parts of the
patchset that change this section of code soooo many times I kinda
lost track of where and why of the little details...

Cheers,

Dave.
