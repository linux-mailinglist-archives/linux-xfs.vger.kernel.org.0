Hnmmmm.  I tried this, but it lead to massive memory corruption
problems, slab leak warnings, and a hang.  If I get around to it I'll
try to see if KASAN will help me figure out what went wrong.

It occurred to me that it might be easier to log the first byte of the
AGI and AGF buffers before the transaction roll, which prevents the bli
from falling off the buffer during the transaction rolling.

Yes that isn't fixing the problem that the unusual use of bhold on a
clean buffer doesn't work right, but <shrug> I don't want to increase
the risks of this patchset by reworking buffer/bli lifetimes when I can
do something simpler. :)
