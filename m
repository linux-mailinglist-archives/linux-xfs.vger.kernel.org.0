In the current code, we set "rec_daddr = end_daddr" only when
(info->last && info->end_daddr != NULL), which should ensure that this
is the last query? Because end_daddr is set to the last device, and
info->last is set to the last query. Therefore, assigning it to
start_daddr should not cause issues in the next query?

Did I misunderstand something? Or is it because the latest code
constantly updates end_daddr, which is why this issue arises?

Yes, my second patch looks at this rt problem...
Thank you for your reply
