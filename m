but ... this doesn't change behavior, right?  The flag is still set.

I think it makes sense to announce deprecation, with a date set for future
removal, but keep all other behavior the same.  That gives people who still
need it (if any exist) time to complain, right?

The same as it did yesterday; the flag is still set for now.

That's my fault, I had suggested moving all the deprecated options to the end.

Maybe with a comment, /* REMOVE ME 2089 */ or whatever we pick?
