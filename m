Every now and then I see a failure when running generic/322 on btrfs:

QA output created by 322
failed to create flakey device

Looking in the 322.full file, I see:

device-mapper: reload ioctl on flakey-test (253:0) failed: Device or resource busy
Command failed.

And looking in dmesg, I see:

device-mapper: table: 8:3: linear: Device lookup failed (-16)
device-mapper: ioctl: error adding target to table

/dev/block/8:3 corresponds to the SCRATCH_DEV on this system.  Given the
failures in 322.out, I think this is caused by generic/322 calling
_init_flakey -> _dmsetup_create -> $DMSETUP_PROG create being unable to
open SCRATCH_DEV exclusively.  Add a call to $UDEV_SETTLE_PROG prior to
the creation of the target to try to calm the system down sufficiently
that the test can proceed.

Note that I don't have any hard evidence that it's udev at fault here --
the few times I've caught this thing, udev *has* been active spraying
error messages for nonexistent sysfs paths to journald and adding a
'udevadm settle' seems to fix it... but that's still only
circumstantial.  Regardless, it seems to have fixed the test failure.
