Yes.

Yes, this can be an issue because when the single CIL work is CPU
bound, it is the first iclog write of the checkpoint that pushes the
previous commit record to disk. So, like you say, there's a natural
pin overlap in this situation.

Yes, AFAICT, this pin problem dates back to day zero. Before delayed
logging it required the inode or buffer to be relogged in almost
every iclog that was written (think a long running truncate removing
hundreds of thousands of extents). But before delayed logging, this
was very slow and limited by iclog IO so having the AIL stall would
have largely been unnoticed.

I don't think we need to do anything like that. All we need to do to
ensure that the AIL can flush a pinned buffer is to lock it, kick
the log and wait for the pin count to go to zero. Then we can write
it just fine, blocking only the front end transactions that need
that buffer lock.  Same goes for inodes, though xfs_iunpin_wait()
already does this....

The only issue is determining if this causes unaaceptible long tail
latencies on buffers like the AG headers....

Cheers,

Dave.
