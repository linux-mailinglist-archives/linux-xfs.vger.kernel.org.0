Probably not.  I changed both disk and log inodes to a union of the old
timestamp struct and a t_nsec64 (as you put it) and it works fine.

The quota timers I've simply reduced the timer resolution from 1s to 4s
to get us an extra two bits, and added a full-size in-core dquot timer
so that we only lose resolution if the fs gets unmounted.  It's kind of
a dirty trick, though.

Still working on it.  In the meantime, I have a question for you and
Arnd: I've started writing more fstests.  How does userspace query the
kernel to find out the supported range of timestamps?  fstests currently
hardcodes it, but yuck.  XFS could find an ioctl/sysfs knob to export
that info, but it really belongs in statvfs or something.
