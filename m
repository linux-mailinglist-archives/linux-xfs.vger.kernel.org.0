Hmm.  A single "zapped" bit would be a good way to signal to
xchk_dir_looks_zapped and xchk_bmap_want_check_rmaps that a file is
probably broken.  Clearing that bit would be harder though -- userspace
would have to call back into the kernel after checking all the metadata.

A simpler way might be to persist the entire per-inode sick state (both
forks and the contents within, for three bits).  That would be more to
track, but each scrubber could clear its corresponding sick-state bit.
A bit further on in this series is a big patchset to set the sick state
every time the hot paths encounter an EFSCORRUPTED.

IO operations could check the sick state bit and fail out to userspace,
which would solve the problem of keeping programs away from a partially
fixed file.

The ondisk state tracking like an entire project on its own.  Thoughts?
