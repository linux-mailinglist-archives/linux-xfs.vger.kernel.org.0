I'm glad people like those, I wasnt sure what people expected or what to 
expect as a response, but I think it helps facilitate the design at 
least for the time being :-)

Well, the idea is that when we first start the routine, we come in with 
neither state set, and we fall through to the break.  So we execute the 
check the first time through.

Though now that you point it out, I should probably go back and put the 
explicit numbering back in the enum (starting with 1) or they will 
default to zero, which would be incorrect.  I had pulled it out in one 
of the last reviews thinking it would be ok, but it should go back in.

Well, the remove path is a lot simpler than the set path, so that trick 
does work here :-)

The idea though was to establish "jump points" with the "XFS_DAS_*" 
states.  Based on the state, we jump back to where we were.  We could 
break this pattern for the remove path, but I dont think we'd want to do 
the same for the others.  The set routine is a really big function that 
would end up being inside a really big switch!

Yes, that is the goal we are working towards.

Sure, will do

Oh i see.  Sure, let me see if that will work, it seems like it should

Because the delayed attr context uses things from those headers.  And we 
put the context in xfs_da_args.  Now everything that uses xfs_da_args 
needs those includes.  But maybe if we do what you suggest above, we 
wont need to. :-)

Thanks for the reviews!  I know its a lot!
