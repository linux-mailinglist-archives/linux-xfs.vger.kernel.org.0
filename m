From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

Some of our scrub stress tests involve racing scrub, fsstress, and a
program that repeatedly freeze and thaws the scratch filesystem.  The
current cleanup code suffers from the deficiency that it doesn't
actually wait for the child processes to exit.  First, change it to do
that.

However, that exposes a second problem: there's a race condition with a
freezer process that leads to the stress test exiting with a frozen fs.
If the freezer process is blocked trying to acquire the unmount or
sb_write locks, the receipt of a signal (even a fatal one) doesn't cause
it to abort the freeze.  This causes further problems with fstests,
since ./check doesn't expect to regain control with the scratch fs
frozen.

Fix both problems by making the cleanup function smarter.
