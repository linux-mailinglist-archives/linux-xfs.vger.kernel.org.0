Not sure I follow this - defer operation counts are something
tracked in the transaction reservations, whilst this is changing the
number of inodes that are joined and held across defer operations.

These rmap updates already occur on the directory inodes in a rename
(when the dir update changes the dir shape), so I'm guessing that
you are now talking about changing parent attrs for the child inodes
may require attr fork shape changes (hence rmap updates) due to the
deferred parent pointer xattr update?

If so, this should be placed in the series before the modifications
to the rename operation is modified to join 4 ops to it, preferably
at the start of the series....

The comment is not useful  - it should desvribe what operation
requires 4 inodes to be joined. e.g.

/*
 * Rename w/ parent pointers requires 4 indoes with defered ops to
 * be joined to the transaction.
 */

Then, if we are changing the maximum number of inodes that are
joined to a deferred operation, then we need to also update the
locking code such as in xfs_defer_ops_continue() that has to order
locking of multiple inodes correctly.

Also, rename can lock and modify 5 inodes, not 4, so the 4 inodes
that get joined here need to be clearly documented somewhere. Also,
xfs_sort_for_rename() that orders all the inodes in rename into
correct locking order in an array, and xfs_lock_inodes() that does
the locking of the inodes in the array.

Cheers,

Dave.
