Yes, it can happen, and it happens before this patch, too, because
the AIL can push the buffer log item directly and that does not
flush dirty inodes to the buffer before it writes back(*).

As it is, xfs_buf_inode_iodone() on a buffer with no inode attached
if functionally identical to the existing xfs_buf_iodone() callback
that would otherwise be done. i.e. it just runs the buffer log item
completion callback. Hence the change here rearranges code, but it
does not change behaviour at all.

(*) this is a double-write bug that this patch set does not address.
i.e. buffer log item flushes the buffer without flushing inodes, IO
compeletes, then inode flush to the buffer and we do another IO to
clean them.  This is addressed by a follow-on patchset that tracks
dirty inodes via ordered cluster buffers, such that pushing the
buffer always triggers xfs_iflush_cluster() on buffers tagged
_XBF_INODES...

That's part of it, as you can see from the (*) above. But the commit
log already says "..., and makes future modifications much simpler."
Was that insufficient to indicate that it will be used later on?

Cheers,

Dave.
