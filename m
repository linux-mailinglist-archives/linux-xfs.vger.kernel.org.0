From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

To allow for iclog IO device cache flush behaviour to be optimised,
we first need to separate out the commit record iclog IO from the
rest of the checkpoint so we can wait for the checkpoint IO to
complete before we issue the commit record.

This separation is only necessary if the commit record is being
written into a different iclog to the start of the checkpoint as the
upcoming cache flushing changes requires completion ordering against
the other iclogs submitted by the checkpoint.

If the entire checkpoint and commit is in the one iclog, then they
are both covered by the one set of cache flush primitives on the
iclog and hence there is no need to separate them for ordering.

Otherwise, we need to wait for all the previous iclogs to complete
so they are ordered correctly and made stable by the REQ_PREFLUSH
that the commit record iclog IO issues. This guarantees that if a
reader sees the commit record in the journal, they will also see the
entire checkpoint that commit record closes off.

This also provides the guarantee that when the commit record IO
completes, we can safely unpin all the log items in the checkpoint
so they can be written back because the entire checkpoint is stable
in the journal.
