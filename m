It occurs to me that we don't care how much we fall short of the
requested allocation.  I could change reserve_agblocks to return true if
it got all the blocks it was asked to get, and then that becomes:

		if (agfl_wanted > 0 &&
		    !reserve_agblocks(sc->mp, agno, btr_bno, agfl_wanted)
			agfl_goal = 0;

How does that sound?
