Chris can clarify, but I don't remember second-long latencies being
mentioned. Rather sampling periods of multiple seconds during which
the spin bursts occur multiple times.

Is that actually true? I'm having trouble finding the corresponding
code in the scheduler.

That said, I'm not sure it matters that much. Even if you take CPU
contention out of the equation entirely, I think we agree it's not a
good idea (from a climate POV) to have CPUs busywait on IO. Even if
that IO is just an ordinary wait_on_page_writeback() on a fast drive.

So if we can get rid of the redirtying, and it sounds like we can, IMO
we should just go ahead and do so.

It seems to me we're just not on the same page on what the reported
bug is. From my POV, there currently isn't a missing piece in this
puzzle. But Chris worked closer with the prod folks on this, so I'll
leave it to him :)
