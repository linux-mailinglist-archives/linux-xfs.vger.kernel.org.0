With active/passive perag references, I don't think this is
necessary anymore. By the time we get to changing
mp->m_sb.sb_agblocks, we've already guaranteed that there is nothing
referencing the perag structures we are about to get rid of. And
if we do a lookup on a agno we've already removed, it'll fail anyway
because that perag can't be found in the radix tree....

Cheers,

Dave.
