No worries, I know the feeling :-)  The set works and all, but I do 
think there is struggle around trying to find a particularly pleasent 
looking presentation of it.  Especially when we get into the set path, 
it's a bit more complex.  I may pick through the patches you habe here 
and pick up the whitespace cleanups and other style adjustments if 
people prefer it that way.  The good news is, a lot of the *_args 
routines are supposed to disappear at the end of the set, so there's not 
really a need to invest too much in them I suppose. It may help to jump 
to the "Set up infastructure" patch too.  I've expanded the diagram to 
try and help illustrait the code flow a bit, so that may help with 
following the code flow.
