If I've gotten this right so far, patch 4 introduces the ability to
flush the data device while we get ready to overwrite parts of the log.
This patch makes it so that writing a commit (or unmount) record to an
iclog causes that iclog write to be issued (to the log device) with at
least FUA set, and possibly PREFLUSH if we've written out more than one
iclog since the last commit?

IOWs, the data device flush is now asynchronous with CIL processing and
we've ripped out all the cache flushes and FUA writes for iclogs except
for the last one in a chain, which should maintain data integrity
requirements 1 and 2?

If that's correct,
