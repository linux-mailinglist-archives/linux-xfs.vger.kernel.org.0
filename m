FWIW, the following subset of your 5.15 patches (or backported version thereof)
have been sitting in my xfs-5.10.y-8 tag since Saturday and have been
spinning in kdevops since (~20 auto runs) with no regressions observed
from v5.10.y baseline:

xfs: punch out data fork delalloc blocks on COW writeback failure
xfs: remove all COW fork extents when remounting readonly
xfs: prevent UAF in xfs_log_item_in_current_chkpt
xfs: only bother with sync_filesystem during readonly remount
xfs: use setattr_copy to set vfs inode attributes
xfs: check sb_meta_uuid for dabuf buffer recovery
xfs: use kmem_cache_free() for kmem_cache objects
xfs: Fix the free logic of state in xfs_attr_node_hasname

So perhaps you could use that as the smaller subset for first posting.
To reduce review burden on xfs maintainers, I could break out of the
chronological patches order and use the same subset for my next set
of candidates for 5.10 after testing them in isolation on top of xfs-5.10.y-3
(at least the ones that apply out of order).

Thanks,
Amir.
