From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

Now that we have all the dirty inodes attached to the cluster
buffer, we don't actually have to do radix tree lookups to find
them. Sure, the radix tree is efficient, but walking a linked list
of just the dirty inodes attached to the buffer is much better.

We are also no longer dependent on having a locked inode passed into
the function to determine where to start the lookup. This means we
can drop it from the function call and treat all inodes the same.

We also make xfs_iflush_cluster skip inodes marked with
XFS_IRECLAIM. This we avoid races with inodes that reclaim is
actively referencing or are being re-initialised by inode lookup. If
they are actually dirty, they'll get written by a future cluster
flush....

We also add a shutdown check after obtaining the flush lock so that
we catch inodes that are dirty in memory and may have inconsistent
state due to the shutdown in progress. We abort these inodes
directly and so they remove themselves directly from the buffer list
and the AIL rather than having to wait for the buffer to be failed
and callbacks run to be processed correctly.

V2:
- rework return value from xfs_iflush_cluster to indicate -EAGAIN if
  no inodes were flushed and handle that case in the caller.
