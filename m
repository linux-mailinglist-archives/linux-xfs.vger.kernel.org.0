Fair enough.  I didn't really like this #4 anyway.  Withdrawn. :)

Urk, sorry about that... I was hoping to land a fix for $largeclient
but then the crazy just kept coming.  Never gonna do /that/ again. :/

<nod>

My workflow is rather different -- I rebase my dev tree off the latest
rc every week, and when a series is ready I port it to a branch off of
for-next.  Occasionally I'll port a refactoring from for-next into my
dev tree to keep the code bases similar.  Both trees get run through
fstests and $whatnot whenever they change, which mean that most mornings
I'm looking at nightlies.

<nod> This would probably help with peoples' ability to distinguish
djwong patchbombs for submission vs. making backups on NYE. ;)

I like that idea.
