The code is setting SOAK_DURATION to 4 minutes, not 5 minutes.
However, when I ran the moral equivalent:

    kvm-xfstests --soak-duration 4m --fail-loop-count 0 -c ext4/4k \
        generic/475 generic/476 generic/521 generic/522 generic/642

It overall took 17 minutes to run, with just under a minute of test
infrastructure overhead (in the check script and my wrapper scripts),
with the actual test time as follows:

ext4/4k: 5 tests, 975 seconds
  generic/475  Pass     242s
  generic/476  Pass     244s
  generic/521  Pass     241s
  generic/522  Pass     241s
  generic/642  Pass     7s
Totals: 5 tests, 0 skipped, 0 failures, 0 errors, 975s

The time which generic/642 ran was surprising so I took a closer look.
It does claim to be in group "soak", and it even tries to canonicalize
SOAK_DURATION (I'm not sure why, since the check script does this
already).  But generic/642 doesn't seem to use SOAK_DURATION.  It does
caculate a DURATION value, but it doesn't actually use SOAK_DURATION.

So that sounds like a bug in the generic/642 test?

There was also a bug xfstests's "make install" in that it doesn't
actually install src/soak_duration.awk, but I'll send that a patch
fixing that under separate cover.

Darrick -- suppose changed the SOAK_DURATION down to 2 minutes?  How
much do you think that would materially affect the code coverage
metrics, and the overall effectiveness of the smoke test?  If we get
generci/642 to honor SOAK_DURATION, using an overall 2 minute soak for
each test would translate to the smoke test taking about 13 minutes,
which would be great from a drive-by patch submitter perspective.
