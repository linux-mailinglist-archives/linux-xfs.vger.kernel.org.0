Hm. Still no luck if I move to .109 and pull in those few patches. I
assume there's nothing else potentially interesting about the test env
other than the sparse file scratch dev (i.e., default mkfs options,
etc.)? If so and you can reliably reproduce, I suppose it couldn't hurt
to try and grab a tracepoint dump of the test when it fails (feel free
to send directly or upload somewhere as the list may punt it, and please
also include the dmesg output that goes along with it) and I can see if
that shows anything helpful.

I think what we want to know initially is what error code we're
producing (-ENOSPC?) and where it originates, and from there we can
probably work out how the transaction might be dirty. I'm not sure a
trace dump will express that conclusively. If you wanted to increase the
odds of getting some useful information it might be helpful to stick a
few trace_printk() calls in the various trans cancel error paths out of
xfs_create() to determine whether it's the inode allocation attempt that
fails or the subsequent attempt to create the directory entry..
