<nod> I agree that it's a very minor disclosure vulnerability (certainly
less severe than ALLOCSP) since you'd need CAP_SYS_RAWIO to exploit it.
But certainly worth patching before someone discovers that a former
pagecache page with your credit card numbers on it got recycled into a
log vector page.  Thanks for doing the fix. :)
