If the dquots are not attached to the inode, how would you pass the
3 dquots per inode down the stack to where they are actually used
inside the filesystem? I mean, we have to get the dquots attached to
the transaction so we can update them in xfs_trans_commit ->
xfs_trans_apply_dquot_deltas(), so somehow we'd have to get them
from the high level file/inode operations down to the XFS
transaction context. And things like writeback need dquots attached
for delayed allocation, so various aops would need to do dquot
lookups, too...

I can see the advantage of doing rcu dquot cache lookups in the xfs
context where we are attaching the dquots to the transaction rather
than attaching them to the inode, but I can't see how the "do it at
a high level" aspect of this would work....

Cheers,

Dave.
