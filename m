Separate branches for 6.14 and 6.15 that then get merged into a for-next
is what I did when I had separate trains running at the same time.  Most
of the time I just rolled the post-rc6 fixes into the next release, so I
usually only dealt with one at a time.

If I had a for-6.14 and a for-6.15 branch, I'd base the PRs off of those
branches, not the for-next branch itself.

Or you can ask the PR submitter to rebase off latest for-6.15 and handle
the merge themselves.
