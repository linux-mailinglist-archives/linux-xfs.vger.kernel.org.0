Should probably indicate why this is needed in the changelog.

This seems ok to me.  I wanted to make sure that "mount -o dax,dax=always"
was accepted properly, because a remount looks to /proc/mounts for existing
options and re-uses what it finds.  It does seem to work correctly.

It's a little weird to emit 2 equivalent options when only one was given, but if
legacy apps rely on finding a bare "dax," then I guess it seems harmless enough...
