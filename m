Is it that much bigger?

Be—ïides the usual problem of casts hiding bugs I think we are fine,
but please double check:

 - the lowlevel xfs directory entry hashing code assumes unsigned
   chars, because of that we long compiled with -funsigned-char just
   for XFS, which got obsoleted by the kernel doing it entirely
   after we've switched all the low-level code to use unsigned
   char.
 - given that traditional unix pathnames are just NULL terminate
   by arrays and the 7-bit CI code doesn't even look at the
   high bit we really don't care about signed vs unsigned except
   for the usual C pitfall when casting or shiftting

So as long as all the low-level code uses unsigned char we should
be fine.
