It turns out reproducing this bug was surprisingly complicated.
After a growfs we can now dip into reserves that made the test1
file start filling up the existing AGs first for a while, and thus
the error injection would hit on that and never even reach a new
AG.

So while agree with your sentiment and like the highlevel idea, I
suspect it will need a fair amount of work to actually be useful.
Right now I'm too busy with various projects to look into it
unfortunately.
