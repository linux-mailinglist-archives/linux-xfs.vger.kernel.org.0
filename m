<nod> I might reformulate the pkill code to use nsexec (and not systemd)
if it's available; systemd scopes if those are available (I figured out
how to get systemd to tell me the cgroup name); or worst case fall back
to process sessions if neither are available.

I don't know how ancient of a userspace we realistically have to support
since (afaict) namespaces and systemd both showed up around the 2.6.24
era?  But I also don't know if Devuan at least does pid/mount
namespaces.

Yup.
