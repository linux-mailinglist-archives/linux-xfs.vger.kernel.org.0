Thanks for your review.

based on code inspection, the logic seems straight-forward

in xlog_do_recovery_pass()
	...

	dbp = xlog_alloc_buffer(log, BTOBB(h_size));
					^ here uses h_size from the tail block
	if (!dbp) {
		kmem_free(hbp);
		return -ENOMEM;
	}

	if (tail_blk > head_blk) {
		while (blk_no < log->l_logBBsize) {
			xlog_bread
			xlog_valid_rec_header
			xlog_recover_process
		}
	}

	while (blk_no < head_blk) {
		xlog_bread
		xlog_valid_rec_header
		xlog_recover_process
	}


in xlog_recover_process()
	crc = xlog_cksum(log, rhead, dp, be32_to_cpu(rhead->h_len));
							^here
	...

and also xlog_recover_process_data()
	end = dp + be32_to_cpu(rhead->h_len);
	...
	while ((dp < end) && num_logops) {
		ohead = (struct xlog_op_header *)dp;
		(all things around dp/ohead if num_logops is crafted as well. 
		...
	}

if hlen <= hsize (hsize > 0) then hlen will be <= INT_MAX

It seems that is partially self-answered in the last part of the email.
So move the response to the last of the email...

Honestly, I really don't want to work on some topic about [un]likely,
I did a long discussion with Dan Carpenter and a couple of other people
last year, but *shrug*

For this case just simply bacause XFS_IS_CORRUPT() has this annotation,
and it seems xlog_valid_rec_header() logic will be changed in v3
if we leave the mkfs workaround logic as is.

also the same words at the last of the email...

Yes

Ok, that is fine. I will leave the mkfs workaround logic as is and rename
to bufsize.
