I think I have reproduced this enough to have some idea about what
is happening here. I has RUI recovery fail converting an unwritten
extent which was added in a RUI+RUD+rmapbt buffer modification a few
operations prior to the RUI that failed. Turns out that the on-disk
buffer had an LSN stamped in it more recent than the LSN of the
checkpoint being recovered and it all goes downhill from there.

The problematic checkpoints at the end of the log overlap
like this:

You can see the commit records for transaction IDs (tid: xxx)
53552074 and c960e383 are ordered differently to the start records.
The checkpoint "tid: 22790ee5" is the last checkpoint in the log
which is incomplete and so isn't recovered.

Now, from this information I don't know whether the commit records
are correctly ordered as the CIL code is suppposed to do, but what
has happened is that log recovery tags checkpoints with the start
lsn of the checkpoint and uses that for recovery. That's the lsn it
stamps into metadata recovered by that commit.

So, we recover "tid: c960e383" first with a lsn of 0x340003732,
then recover "tid: 53552074" with a lsn of 0x3400003632. Hence even
if the commit records are correctly ordered, log recovery screws up
the LSN used to recover the checkpoints and hence incorrectly
recovers buffers and stamps incorrect LSNs into buffers.

So, once this is all recovered, we go to handle outstanding intents.
We start with a RUI that is an rmap conversion, and it fails to find
the rmap record that it is converting and assert fails. It didn't
find the record because the rmapbt block modification was not
replayed because the on-disk rmapbt block was updated in "tid:
c960e383" and so has a lsn of 0x340003732 stamped in it. And so the
modification that added the record in "tid: 53552074" was skipped
because it ran with an LSN less than what was already on disk.

IOWs, we got a RUI conversion failure because the above two nested
checkpoints were either replayed out of order or were replayed with
the incorrect LSNs.

From here, I'm working as I write this because, well, complex... :/

Hypothesis: If the two nested checkpoints had their commit records
written out of order, then what wasn't complete in 53552074 should
be in c960e383 but was ignored. There were only two RUIs left
incomplete in 53552074 (i.e. had no RUD+rmapbt buffer mods) and they
weren't in c960e383. Hence c960e383 does not follow 53552074.
Indeed, I found both RUDs at the start of checkpoint 22790ee5 (which
wasn't complete or replayed), hence log recovery was correct to be
replaying those RUIs.

So, lets use this same intent -> intent done split across
checkpoints to verify that 53552074 follows c960e383. So:

Yup, there's the ordering evidence. The checkpoint sequence is:

d3047f93 (RUI 0xffff888034f3edb0)
c960e383 (RUD 0xffff888034f3edb0)

c960e383 (RUI 0xffff8880422f1d90)
53552074 (RUD 0xffff8880422f1d90)

53552074 (RUI 0xffff8880422f35c0)
22790ee5 (RUD 0xffff8880422f35c0)

So what we have here is log recovery failing to handle checkpoints
that -start- out of order in the log because it uses the /start lsn/
for recovery LSN sequencing, not the commit record LSN. However, it
uses the commit record ordering for sequencing the recovery of
checkpoints. The code that uses the start lsn for recvery of commit
records appears to be:

STATIC int
xlog_recover_items_pass2(
        struct xlog                     *log,
        struct xlog_recover             *trans,
        struct list_head                *buffer_list,
        struct list_head                *item_list)
{
        struct xlog_recover_item        *item;
        int                             error = 0;

        list_for_each_entry(item, item_list, ri_list) {
                trace_xfs_log_recover_item_recover(log, trans, item,
                                XLOG_RECOVER_PASS2);

                if (item->ri_ops->commit_pass2)
                        error = item->ri_ops->commit_pass2(log, buffer_list,
>>>>>>>>>>                               item, trans->r_lsn);
                if (error)
                        return error;
        }

        return error;
}

trans->r_lsn is the LSN where the start record for the
commit is found, not the LSN the commit record was found. At run
time, we do all our ordering off start record LSN because new
journal writes cannot be allowed to overwrite the start of the
checkpoint before every item in the checkpoint has been written back
to disk. If we were to use the commit record LSN, the AIL would
allow the tail of the log to move over the start of the checkpoint
before every thing was written.

However, what is the implication of the AIL having -start lsns- for
checkpoint sequences out of order? And for log recovery finding the
head of the log? I think it means we have the potential for
checkpoint N to be complete in the log an needing recovery, but
checkpoint N+1 is not complete because we've allowed the tail of the
log to move past the start of that checkpoint. That will also cause
corruption log recovery corruption. And I have a sneaking suspiciion
that this may cause fsync/log force issues as well....

----

Ok, time to step back and think about this for a bit. The good news
is that this can only happen with pipelined CIL commits, while means
allowing more than one CIL push to be in progress at once. We can
avoid this whole problem simply by setting the CIL workqueue back to
running just a single ordered work at a time. Call that Plan B.

The bad news is that this is zero day bug, so all kernels out there
will fail to recovery with out of order start records. Back before
delayed logging, we could have mulitple transactions commit to the
journal in just about any order and nesting, and they used exactly
the same start/commit ordering in recovery that is causing us
problems now. This wouldn't have been noticed, however, because
transactions were tiny back then, not huge checkpoints like we run
now. And if is was, it likely would have been blamed on broken
storage because it's so ephemeral and there was little test
infrastructure that exercised these paths... :/

What this means is that we can't just make a fix to log recovery
because taking a log from a current kernel and replaying it on an
older kernel might still go very wrong, and do so silently. So I
think we have to fix what we write to the log.

Hence I think the only way forward here is to recognise that the
AIL, log forces and log recovery all require strictly ordered
checkpoint start records (and hence LSNs) as well as commit records.
We already strictly order the commit records (and this analysis
proves it is working correctly), so we should be able to leverage
the existing functionality to do this.

So I think I see a simple way out of this. I'll sleep on it and see
if if I still think that in the morning...

Cheers,

Dave.
