I was more commenting on the new code. The old code is horrible,
yes, but I don't think the new code is much better. :(

Look at what quoting did to it - it'll look the same as above in
patches, unfortunately, so I don't think "short as possible" works
any better.

Perhaps s/IFBAD/XFS_CORRUPT_IF/ ?

		XFS_CORRUPT_IF(be32_to_cpu(sib_info->back) != last_blkno ||
				sib_info->magic != dead_info->magic)) {
			xfs_error(mp, "user readable error message");
			return -EFSCORRUPTED;
		}

That solves the patch/quote indent problem, documents the code well,
and only sacrifices a single tab for the condition statements...

/me gets back on his bike and leaves the shed coated in wet paint.

Cheers,

Dave.
