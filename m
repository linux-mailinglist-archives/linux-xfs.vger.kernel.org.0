My suggestion is to, at minimum, separate the above two logic changes
into separate patches. Item #2 above is a functional check in that it
ensures each record fits into the record buffer size we've allocated
(based on h_size) at the start of recovery. This item is what my
feedback above was referring to and I think is a fairly straightforward
change.

Item #1 is a bit more nebulous. h_size refers to the iclog size used by
the kernel that wrote to the log. I think it should be uniform across
all records and AFAICT it doesn't serve a functional purpose (validation
notwithstanding) for recovery beyond establishing the size of the buffer
we should allocate to process records. The mkfs workaround implements a
case where we have to ignore the on-disk h_size and use the in-core
iclog size, and that is currently isolated to a single place. I'm not
fundamentally against more h_size verification beyond current usage, but
if that means we have to consider the workaround for multiple records
(which is confusing and incorrect) or make subtle runtime changes like
quietly tweaking the in-core record header structure from what is on
disk, then I don't think it's worth the complexity.

If we _really_ wanted to include such a change, I think a more
appropriate validation check might be to similarly track the h_size from
the initial record and simply verify that the values are uniform across
all processed records. That way we don't conflict or impose the
workaround logic on the underlying log format rules. It also catches the
(unlikely) case that the mkfs workaround is applied on the first record
incorrectly because h_size is corrupt and there are more records that
conflict. Also note that v5 filesystems enforce record CRC checks
anyways, so this still might be of limited value...
