I wrote it this way to leave the formatting behavior unchanged on older
filesystems, figuring that you'd be wary of anything that could generate
bug reports about old fs formats, e.g. "Why does my cloud deployment
image generator report that the minified filesystem size went up when I
went from X to X+1?"

So now that I've guessed incorrectly, I guess I'll go change this to do
it unconditionally.  Or drop the whole thing entirely.  I don't know.
I'm too burned out to be able to think reasonably anymore.

Frankly, I don't have the time to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
this the problem is exactly as stated, that the code change is exactly
the correct fix, that no other fix is more appropriate, and that there
are no other possible explanations for the slowness being complained
aobut.  I really just wanted to do this one little thing that we've all
basically agreed is the right thing.

Instead I'll just leave things as they are, and consider whether there
even is a future for me working on XFS.
