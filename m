BTOBB, not BBTOB ;-)

Indeed. Perhaps the macros should be fixed?

    #define BBSHIFT         9
    #define BBSIZE          (1<<BBSHIFT)
    #define BBMASK          (BBSIZE-1)
    #define BTOBB(bytes)    (((__u64)(bytes) + BBSIZE - 1) >> BBSHIFT)
    #define BTOBBT(bytes)   ((__u64)(bytes) >> BBSHIFT)

Why are these two casting bytes to u64? The result will be smaller
due to the shift.
if the type holding bytes was too small, you're screwed anyway.

    #define BBTOB(bbs)      ((bbs) << BBSHIFT)

Why does this one lack the cast? If the passed bbs is ever 32-bit,
it may overflow due to the shift.

While adding checks would work for e.g. roundup(), it wouldn't work
for plain divisions not involving rounding, as we don't have a way to
catch this for "a / b", except for the link error on 32-bit platforms.

Perhaps the build bots are not monitoring linux-xfs?
