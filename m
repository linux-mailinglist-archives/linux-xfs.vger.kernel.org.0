Sorry for resurrecting an old thread here, but I was thinking about this
problem a bit and realized I didn't have a great handle on the concerns
with using unwritten extents for delalloc writeback. Dave calls out the
O_DSYNC buffered writes into sparse files case above. I don't see any
numbers posted here so I ran some quick tests using a large ramdisk to
get low latency I/O.

I only seem to require a couple threads to max out single file, random
4k dsync buffered write iops in this particular setup. I see ~30.6k iops
from a baseline 5.7.0-rc1 kernel and that drops to ~25.7k iops when
using unwritten extents for delalloc conversion. However, note that the
same workload through single threaded aio+dio (qd 32) runs at ~63.7k
iops. That's already using unwritten extents for dio so it's unaffected
by this patch. Also note that using a 10MB extent size hint puts the
dsync buffered write case at ~27k iops (again for both kernels because
we're already using unwritten extents in that case as well).

For reference, full file preallocation (i.e. no allocs, unwritten
extents) runs at ~27k iops for the buffered write case and ~87k iops for
aio+dio. The overwrite (no unwritten, no alloc) case gets to ~250k iops
with the same couple dsync buffered write threads and close to 300k iops
with single threaded aio+dio (which I think is maxing out my memory
bandwidth).

Altogether, this has me wondering whether it's really worth the
complexity of trying to avoid the overhead of unwritten extents for
delalloc conversion. There is a noticeable hit, but it's an already slow
path compared to async I/O mechanisms. Further, it's a workload that
typically comes with a recommendation to use extent size hints to avoid
fragmentation issues and minimize allocation overhead, and that feature
already bypasses delalloc extents in favor of unwritten extents.
Thoughts? Suggestions for other tests?
