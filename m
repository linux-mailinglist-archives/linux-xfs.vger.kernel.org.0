>=20

What do you mean by "the overall system doesn't know the stripe unit
values" at mkfs time? Shouldn't these values originate from the
underlying storage? Is there some additional configuration at play in
this particular use case?

The migration use case certainly sounds valid, though my understanding
is that if an existing stripe configuration is in place, it's usually
best for the new storage configuration to take that into consideration
(and use some multiple of stripe unit or something, for example).

Ok, thanks. I'd argue that we should return the runtime results if we
took the proposed approach, but we should probably settle on a solution
first..
