ISTR that this won't happen during extent allocation because the
transaction reservation and the AG selection code is supposed to
ensure there are sufficient free blocks both globally and in the AG
for the entire operation, not just one part of it.

Also, the extent freeing path is this:

...
  __xfs_free_extent()
    xfs_free_extent_fix_freelist()
      xfs_alloc_fix_freelist(XFS_ALLOC_FLAG_FREEING)

And that XFS_ALLOC_FLAG_FREEING is special - it means that we:

a) always say there is space available in the AG for the freeing
operation to take place, and
b) only perform best effort allocation to fill up the free list.

Case b) triggers this code:

                /*
                 * Stop if we run out.  Won't happen if callers are obeying
                 * the restrictions correctly.  Can happen for free calls
                 * on a completely full ag.
                 */
                if (targs.agbno == NULLAGBLOCK) {
                        if (flags & XFS_ALLOC_FLAG_FREEING)
                                break;
                        goto out_agflbp_relse;
                }


That is, if we fail to fix up the free list, we still go ahead with
the operation because freeing extents when we are at ENOSPC means
that, by definition, we don't need to allocate blocks to track the
new free space because the new free space records will fit inside
the root btree blocks that are already allocated.

Hence when doing allocation for the free list, we need to fail the
allocation rather than block on the only remaining free extent in
the AG. If we are freeing extents, the AGFL not being full is not an
issue at all. And if we are allocating extents, the transaction
reservations should have ensured that the AG had sufficient space in
it to complete the entire operation without deadlocking waiting for
space.

Either way, I don't see a problem with making sure the AGFL
allocations just skip busy extents and fail if the only free extents
are ones this transaction has freed itself.

Cheers,

Dave.
