From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

Run each test program with a separate session id so that we can tell
pkill to kill all processes of a given name, but only within our own
session id.  This /should/ suffice to run multiple fstests on the same
machine without one instance shooting down processes of another
instance.

This fixes a general problem with using "pkill --parent" -- if the
process being targeted is not a direct descendant of the bash script
calling pkill, then pkill will not do anything.  The scrub stress tests
make use of multiple background subshells, which is how a ^C in the
parent process fails to result in fsx/fsstress being killed.

This is necessary to fix SOAK_DURATION runtime constraints for all the
scrub stress tests.  However, there is a cost -- the test program no
longer runs with the same controlling tty as ./check, which means that
^Z doesn't work and SIGINT/SIGQUIT are set to SIG_IGN.  IOWs, if a test
wants to kill its subprocesses, it must use another signal such as
SIGPIPE.  Fortunately, bash doesn't whine about children dying due to
fatal signals if the children run in a different session id.
Unfortunately we have to let it run the test as a background process for
bash to handle SIGINT, and SIGSTOP no longer works properly.

This solution is a bit crap, and I have a better solution for it in the
next patch.  Unfortunately, that solution adds new minimum requirements
for running fstests and removing previously supported configurations
abruptly during a bug fix is not appropriate behavior.

I also explored alternate designs, and this was the least unsatisfying:

a) Setting the process group didn't work because background subshells
are assigned a new group id.

b) Constraining the pkill/pgrep search to a cgroup could work, but it
seems that procps has only recently (~2023) gained the ability to filter
on a cgroup.  Furthermore, we'd have to set up a cgroup in which to run
the fstest.  The last decade has been rife with user bug reports
complaining about chaos resulting from multiple pieces of software (e.g.
Docker, systemd, etc.) deciding that they own the entire cgroup
structure without having any means to enforce that statement.  We should
not wade into that mess.

c) Putting test subprocesses in a systemd sub-scope and telling systemd
to kill the sub-scope could work because ./check can already use it to
ensure that all child processes of a test are killed.  However, this is
an *optional* feature, which means that we'd have to require systemd.

d) Constraining the pkill/pgrep search to a particular pid namespace
could work, but we already have tests that set up their own mount
namespaces, which means the constrained pgrep will not find all child
processes of a test.  Though this hasn't been born out through testing?

e) Constraining to any other type of namespace (uts, pid, etc) might not
work because those namespaces might not be enabled.  However, combining
a private pid and mount namespace to isolate tests from each other seems
to work better than session ids.  For older systems, however, we will
need this as a (probably deprecated) fallback.

f) Revert check-parallel and go back to one fstests instance per system.
Zorro already chose not to revert.

So.  Change _run_seq to create a the ./$seq process with a new session
id, update _su calls to use the same session as the parent test, update
all the pkill sites to use a wrapper so that we only target processes
created by *this* instance of fstests, and update SIGINT to SIGPIPE.
