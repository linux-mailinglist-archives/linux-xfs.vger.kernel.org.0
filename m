The problem is that I can't kill XFS_MOUNT_ATTR2 until all the
m_features infrastructure is in place to replace XFS_MOUNT_ATTR2
being set in m_flags. We still have to check that the mount options
are valid (i.e. attr2 && noattr2 is not allowed) before we read in
the superblock and determine if XFS_SB_VERSION_ATTR2BIT is set on
disk...

It's a catch-22 situation, and this was the simplest way I could
come up with to enable a relatively clean change-over...

Cheers,

Dave.
