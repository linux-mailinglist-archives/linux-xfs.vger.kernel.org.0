synchronous as in O_(D)SYNC or as in "not using AIO"? Is is also
append data, and is it one file per logging thread or multiple
threads writing to a single file?

So, up to 400 threads concurrently issuing IO that does block
allocation and performing unwritten extent conversion, so up to ~800
concurrent running allocation related transactions at a time?

No surprise, AG selection is based on the is based on trying to get
an adjacent extent for file extension. Hence assuming random
distribution because of contention and skipping done by the search
algorithm, then if we have ~50 AGs and 400 writers trying to
allocate at the same time then you've got, on average, 8 allocations
per AG being attempted roughly concurrently.

Of course, append write workloads tend to respond really well to
extent size hints - make sure you allocate a large chunk that
extents beyond EOF on the first write, then subsequent extending
writes only need unwritten extent conversion which shouldn't need
AGF access because it won't require BMBT block allocation during
conversion because it's just taking away from the unwritten extent
and putting the space into the adjacent written extent.

Well, the "running out of log space" problem is still going to
largely be caused by having up to 400 concurrent unwritten extent
conversion transactions running at any given point in time...

I'm suggesting the latter.

Along with a refusal to make an XFS filesystem smaller than, say,
256MB, because allowing users to make tiny XFS filesystems seems to
always just lead to future troubles.
