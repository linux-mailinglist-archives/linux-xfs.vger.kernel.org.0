Oh, is that what you are asking for? You were talking about changing
the API for all the callers that didn't use XFS_LOG_SYNC to make
them all async, not about a one-off, single use wrapper for the AIL.

If all you want is a single line wrapper function, then don't
suggest that the whole API should be reworked and callers changed to
use a new API. *Ask for a one-line wrapper to be added*.

This wrapper will still need to go away in the near future, but at
least it doesn't involve changing lots of unrelated code...

Cheers,

Dave.
