What about checking for differences in kernel messages between the
stripped down and stocked kernel, during device discovery. That is
connect no drives, boot the stripped kernel with the problem, connect
one of the problem USB devices, record the kernel messages that
result. Repeat that with the stock Debian kernel that doesn't exhibit
the bug.

My guess is this is some obscure USB related bug. There are a ton of
bugs with USB enclosure firmware, controllers, and drivers.

Also, is this USB enclosure directly connected to the computer? Or to
a powered hub? I have inordinate problems with USB enclosures directly
connected to an Intel NUC, but when connected to a Dyconn USB hub with
external power source, the problems all go away. And my understanding
is the hub doesn't just act like a repeater. It pretty much rewrites
the entire stream. So there's something screwy going on either with
the Intel controller I have, or the USB-SATA bridge chip, that causes
confusing that the hub eliminates.

And it may be that your stripped down kernel has turned off some
obscure USB related error checking or mode switching that this
particular setup needs.
