Shouldn't we just make xfs_inactive() unconditionally detatch dquots
rather than just in the conditional case it does now after attaching
dquots because it has to make modifications? For inodes that don't
require any inactivation work, we get the same thing, and for those
that do running a few extra transactions before dropping the dquots
isn't going to make a huge difference to the quotaoff latency....

Cheers,

Dave.
