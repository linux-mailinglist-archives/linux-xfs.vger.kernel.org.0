Ok, thank you.  It's easier to develop xfsprogs code when libxfs can be
kept in sync easily.

Yeah, 'tis true that sending xfsprogs libxfs patches prematurely is just
noise on the list. :/

That said, the closer a patchset gets to final review, the tidier the
xfsprogs part ought to be.  I've added support in repair and the
debugger, which means this is /very/ close to its final review.
