Because we've processed the recovery of it - it is either completely
done or we have a new intent in the CIL ready to continue operation.
Either way, the next write to the journal will remove the item from
the AIL when it completes.

Intents don't need to be in the AIL, though - we can cancel them
in memory (see the intent whiteout code) and so when we process the
done item from journal IO completion the last reference goes away
and they won't be in the AIL at this point in time.

IOWs, the intent freeing code doesn't care if the intent is in the
AIL or not, it does the right thing either way.

Hence if we remove the intent from the list of intents that need to
be recovered after we have done the initial recovery, we acheive two
things:

1. the tail of the log can be moved forward with the commit of the
done intent or new intent to continue the operation, and

2. We avoid the problem of trying to determine how many reference
counts we need to drop from intent recovery cancelling because we
never come across intents we've actually attempted recovery on.

THe reference counting ensures the right thing is done when the last
reference goes away. If it is in the AIL, it will get removed, if it
is not in the AIL, then AIL removal is a no-op and nothign bad
happens.

Cheers,

Dave.
