I don't recall doing so, but I must have. I guess I remember this coming up
a while ago and maybe I failed to change process in a sticky way.  :/

But - if my local toolchain can cause a regression in a major distro, it seems
like this patch to regenerate is the obvious path forward, to control
the distro-specific build, and not be subject to my personal toolchain whims.

Is that not best practice? (I honestly don't know.)
