Yes, dbench is a fixed time workload but in fact there is the workload file
that gets executed in a loop. We run a modified version of dbench
(https://github.com/mcgrof/dbench) which also reports time spent by each
execution of the workload file (--show-execute-time option), which has much
better statistical properties than throughput reported by dbench normally
(which is for example completely ignorant of metadata operations and that
leads to big fluctuations in reported numbers especially for high client
counts).

Thanks for detailed explanation! I'd just note that e.g. for a machine with
8 CPUs, 32 GB of Ram and Intel SSD behind a megaraid_sas controller (it is
some Dell PowerEdge server) we see even larger regressions like:

                    good                      bad
Amean 	1	97.93	( 0.00%)	135.67	( -38.54%)
Amean 	2	147.69	( 0.00%)	194.82	( -31.91%)
Amean 	4	242.82	( 0.00%)	352.98	( -45.36%)
Amean 	8	375.36	( 0.00%)	591.03	( -57.45%)

I didn't investigate on this machine (it was doing some other tests and I
had another machine in my hands which also showed some, although smaller,
regression) but now reading your explanations I'm curious why the
regression grows with number of threads on that machine. Maybe the culprit
is different there or just the dynamics isn't as we imagine it on that
storage controller... I guess I'll borrow the machine and check it.

Yes, for higher thread counts I agree flush merging should mitigate the
impact. But note that there is still some overhead of additional flushes
because the block layer will merge only with flushes that are queued and
not yet issued to the device. If there is flush in progress, new flush will
be queued and will get submitted once the first one completes. It is only
the third flush that gets merged to the second one.
