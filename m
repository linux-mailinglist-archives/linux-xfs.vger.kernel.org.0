I am confused about how "noattr2" showed up.

But we do still emit "attr2" in /proc/mounts, and a remount will complain
about /that/, so we do need to stop emitting deprecated options in /proc/mounts.

# mount /dev/pmem0p1 /mnt/test
# grep pmem /proc/mounts 
/dev/pmem0p1 /mnt/test xfs rw,seclabel,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,noquota 0 0
# mount -o remount,ro /mnt/test
# dmesg | tail -n 1
[346311.064017] XFS: attr2 mount option is deprecated.

Pavel, can you fix this up, since your patch did the deprecations? I guess we
missed this on review.

Ideally the xfs(5) man page in xfsprogs should be updated as well to reflect the
deprecated items.
