I think this assertion is incorrect.

Recycling can occur on any inode that has been evicted from the VFS
cache. i.e. while the inode is sitting in XFS_IRECLAIMABLE state
waiting for the background inodegc to run (every ~5s by default) a
->lookup from the VFS can occur and we find that same inode sitting
there in XFS_IRECLAIMABLE state. This lookup then hits the recycle
path.

In this case, even though we re-instantiate the inode into the same
identity, it goes through a transient state where the inode has it's
identity returned to the default initial "just allocated" VFS state
and this transient state can be visible from RCU lookups within the
RCU grace period the inode was evicted from. This means the RCU
lookup could see the inode with i_ops having been reset to
&empty_ops, which means any method called on the inode at this time
(e.g. ->get_link) will hit a NULL pointer dereference.

This requires multiple concurrent lookups on the same inode that
just got evicted, some which the RCU pathwalk finds the old stale
dentry/inode pair, and others that don't find that old pair. This is
much harder to trip over but, IIRC, we used to see this quite a lot
with NFS server workloads when multiple operations on a single inode
could come in from multiple clients and be processed in parallel by
knfsd threads. This was quite a hot path before the NFS server had an
open-file cache added to it, and it probably still is if the NFS
server OFC is not large enough for the working set of files being
accessed...

Hence we have to ensure that RCU lookups can't find an evicted inode
through anything other than xfs_iget() while we are re-instantiating
the VFS inode state in xfs_iget_recycle().  Hence the RCU state
sampling needs to be done unconditionally for all inodes going
through ->destroy_inode so we can ensure grace periods expire for
all inodes being recycled, not just those that required
inactivation...

Cheers,

Dave.
