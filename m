xfs_db is an interactive operation.If a lock is added, the lock may be held
for too long. xfs_repair only repairs the data inside the file system ,so it's
unlikely to conflict with systemd. So these two commands aren't locked.

Systemd normally uses "watch" to monitor disks, only in special cases
will the monitoring be released. During the time from the release of
monitoring to the re-opening of monitoring, the flock is used to
ensure that the disk won't be written to by others.
So if the disk isn't modified or the modified content won't trigger
the udev rule, then it should be OK not to lock.

There is still a problem with this solution, systemd only lock the main
block device, not the partition device. So if we're operating on a
partitioned device, the lock won't work. Currently we are still
communicating with systemd.
