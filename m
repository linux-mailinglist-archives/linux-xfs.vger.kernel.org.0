Use a switch statement on cur->bc_btnum and a function call to free
the cursor? That's about the same CPU cost as a cacheline miss
when looking up the global array for the cache pointer.

The other obvious way of doing it is putting the cache pointer in
the cursor itself. Cost is 8 bytes per cursor, but you've just
reduced the size of most cursors by more than that so I see no big
deal in using some of that space. It also means we don't take a
cacheline miss just to look up the array that contains the pointer -
the cursor will be hot at this point in time....

<looks at kmem cache code>

Huh.

Both slab and slub keep the cache pointer in page->slab_cache. They
don't actually need (or use!) the cache pointer to be supplied -
kfree() would work just fine on kmem_cache allocated objects.

The problem is SLOB - it doesn't do this, and the kmem_cache
implementation is subtly different to the kmalloc implementation
and it doesn't store the slab cache on page->slab_cache. So to
support SLOB, we have to use kmem_cache_free().

How's this for a triple negative that makes you scratch your head,
but demonstrates that SLAB/SLUB can handle null cache pointers
correctly:

/*
 * Caller must not use kfree_bulk() on memory not originally allocated
 * by kmalloc(), because the SLOB allocator cannot handle this.
 */
static __always_inline void kfree_bulk(size_t size, void **p)
{
        kmem_cache_free_bulk(NULL, size, p);
}

Ok, so we can't completely optimise the cache pointer way (which
would be the best solution), so I'd be leaning towards a pointer
within the cursor..

I'm not trying to hide anything, just trying to keep the
implementation modular and not reliant on an explosion of one-off
global constructs that have to be repeatedly looked up on every
operation. Just keep a pointer to the zone in the cursor....

Please err on the side of verbosity in commit messages - it's better
to document the obvious than it is to omit important design
criteria.  Anyone reading the code is not going to know what your
design constraints were if you don't document them. Making sure
everyone knows you've created lots of little functions to build a
global table in the kernel code "because userspace" needs to know
of that "because userspace" requirement...

I still don't like global tables like this we have to look up on
every cursor del operation. I'd much prefer the object carries the
state needed for generic code to perform operations on it
efficiently...

Cheers,

Dave.
