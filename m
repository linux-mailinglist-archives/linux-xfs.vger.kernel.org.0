Indeed, This is a KVM guest on a ppc64le machine. The guest has 8 vcpus
allocated to it. Also, Linux on ppc64le is by default configured to be
non-preemptable.

Btw, the issue is still re-creatable after adding,

+               if ((log->l_flags & XLOG_RECOVERY_NEEDED)
+                       && !xfs_ail_min(tp->t_mountp->m_ail))
+                       tp->t_flags |= XFS_TRANS_SYNC;

... to xfs_trans_reserve(). I didn't get a chance to debug it yet. I will try
to find the root cause now.
