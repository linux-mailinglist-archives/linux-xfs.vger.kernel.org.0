We already have that tool that exercises stepwise flush/fua aware
write recovery for filesystem testing: dm-logwrites was written and
integrated into fstests years ago (2016?) by Josef Bacik for testing
btrfs recovery, but it was a generic solution that all filesystems
can use to test failure recovery....

See, for example, common/dmlogwrites and tests/generic/482 - g/482
uses fsstress to randomly modify the filesystem while dm-logwrites
records all the writes made by the filesystem. It then replays them
one flush/fua at a time, mounting the filesystem to ensure that it
can recover the filesystem, then runs filesystem checkers to ensure
that the filesystem does not have any corrupt metadata. Then it
replays to the next flush/fua and repeats.

tools/dm-logwrite-replay provides a script and documents the
methodology to run step by step through replay of g/482 failures to
be able to reliably reproduce and diagnose the cause of the failure.

There's no need to re-invent the wheel if we've already got a
perfectly good one...

Yes.

Of course, there are software bugs, so mounts, recovery and
subsequent repair testing can still fail.

Yes, and they may even prevent the filesystem from being mounted
because recovery trips over them (e.g. processing pending unlinked
inodes or replaying incomplete intents).

Good luck with that - storage hardware fails in ways that no
existing filesystem can recover automatically from 100% of the time.
And very few even attempt to do so because it is largely an
impossible requirement to fulfil. Torn writes are just the tip of
the iceberg....

Cheers,

Dave.
