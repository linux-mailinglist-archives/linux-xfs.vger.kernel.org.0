Oh, I just meant that the caller has to know and tell the blockgc scan
if it is ok to take locks and whatnot (sync) or if it has to trylock
(async).

I think it makes sense that the background scanner won't nuke the cow
fork if the file's open for write.  I guess this is a bit racy in that
someone could open a nondirty file for write *right here* and nuke
speculative preallocations... but it still sounds like a reasonable
advance over what we have now.

Apparently I dropped it. :(

The idea sounds good to me.
