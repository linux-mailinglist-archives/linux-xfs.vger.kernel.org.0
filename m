Sorry, I didn't realise Eric had pulled it in. I'm not keep a close
eye on exactly what non-libxfs-sync stuff going into xfsprogs right
now - I've had to filter that stuff out to concentrate on the kernel
cycle stuff...

As it is, it's fine however we reject this case, isn't? it doesn't
have to be the root inode error message that causes it to abort, as
long as we get a non-zero exit value. Hence the above method would
fail with both old and new mkfs binaries, even if they are detecting
the issue differently.

Worth checking, because ISTM that if it doesn't fail on old mkfs,
then we'd still the non "-N" version or the targetted log size
variant like above. Of course, I could still be misunderstanding
what you're trying to exercise here...

Cheers,
