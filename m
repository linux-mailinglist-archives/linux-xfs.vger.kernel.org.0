There are flaky tests which can cause a crash, and that is why I started
to expunge these. Not all flaky tests cause a crash though. And so, this
is why in the format I suggested you can specify metadata such as if a
test caused a crash.

At this point I agree that the way kdevops simply skips flaky test which
does not cause a crash should be changed, and if the test is just known
to fail though non deterministically but without a crash it would be
good then at the end to simply not treat that failure as fatal. If
however the failure rate does change it would be useful to update that
information. Without metadata one cannot process that sort of stuff.

The way the expunge list is process could simply be modified in kdevops
so that non-deterministic tests are not expunged but also not treated as
fatal at the end. But think about it, the exception is if the non-deterministic
failure does not lead to a crash, no?

Here's the thing though. Not all developers have incentives to share.
For a while SLE didn't have public expunges, that changed after OpenSUSE
Leap 15.3 as it has binary compatibility with SLE15.3 and so the same
failures on workflows/fstests/expunges/opensuse-leap/15.3/ are applicable/.
It is up to each distro if they wish to share and without a public
vehicle to do so why would they, or how would they?

For upstream and stable I would hope there is more incentives to share.
But again, no shared home ever had existed before. And I don't think
there was ever before dialog about sharing a home for these.

This effort is valuable and thanks for doing all this.

As you are witness to it, running fstests against any fs takes a lot of
time and patience, and as I have noted, not many have incentives to
share. So the best I could do is provide the solution to enable folks to
reproduce testing as fast and as easy as possible and let folks who are
interested to share, to do so. And obvioulsy at least I did get a major
enterprise distro to share some results. Hope others could follow.

So I expect the format for sharing then to be lead by those who have a
clear incentive to do so. Folks working on upstream or stable stakeholders
seem like an obvious candidates. And then it is just volunteer work.
