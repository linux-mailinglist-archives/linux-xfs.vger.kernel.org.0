Yes, that's exactly what I was referring to.

Which is a pretty good definition of "harmless warning".

In retrospect, next time you might first inquire as to what the
issue being referred to is. If you are going to assume anything,
assume good intentions and that the engineer sending the pull
request has done what they have done for a good reason. Once you
know what that reason is you've got the right context to then
educate the OP about the correct procedure in an amicable manner.
