From: Darrick J. Wong <darrick.wong@oracle.com>

The V4 filesystem format contains known weaknesses in the on-disk format
that make metadata verification diffiult.  In addition, the format will
does not support dates past 2038 and will not be upgraded to do so.
Therefore, we should start the process of retiring the old format to
close off attack surfaces and to encourage users to migrate onto V5.

Therefore, make XFS V4 support a configurable option.  For the first
period it will be default Y in case some distributors want to withdraw
support early; for the second period it will be default N so that anyone
who wishes to continue support can do so; and after that, support will
be removed from the kernel.

+Deprecation of V4 Format
+========================
+
+The V4 filesystem format lacks certain features that are supported by
+the V5 format, such as metadata checksumming, strengthened metadata
+verification, and the ability to store timestamps past the year 2038.
+Because of this, the V4 format is deprecated.  All users should upgrade
+by backing up their files, reformatting, and restoring from the backup.
+
+Administrators and users can detect a V4 filesystem by running xfs_info
+against a filesystem mountpoint and checking for a string beginning with
+"crc=".  If the string "crc=0" is found, or no "crc=" string is found,
+the filesystem is a V4 filesystem.
+
+The deprecation will take place in two parts.  Support for mounting V4
+filesystems can now be disabled at kernel build time via Kconfig option.
+The option will default to yes until September 2025, at which time it
+will be changed to default to no.  In September 2030, support will be
+removed from the codebase entirely.
