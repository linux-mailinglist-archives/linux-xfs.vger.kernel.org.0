Sorry, what? This should be a straight factoring - the place we do
the ordering check must not change because that'll break shit.

Ngggh.

Yeah, thanks git. When I rebased the patch, it's merged the hunk
into the wrong place. It gets fixed up later when I move the ordering
inside the xlog_cil_write_commit_record() function, but this patch
by itself was silently broken by the tooling.
