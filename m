(cont.)

ok, thanks for this. anyway, I will cover such case in the next version.

I found the first patch of this patchset has been merged into for-next,
so some new idea about this? (split delta into 2 variables or some else
way you'd prefer? so I could update in the next version as a whole...)

I tried to use it as a global context structure for shrinking the whole AGs
and the tail AG since I'm not sure we need to introduce another new structure
to make it more complex, but yeah the naming is somewhat confusing now.

I didn't notice such trick before, will find some clue about this as well.

Also as Brian mentioned, I'm not sure why xfs_ag_resv_free() the last AG
and xfs_fs_reserve_ag_blocks() after AGF/AGI are unlocked for growfs...
I think there could be some race window if some other fs allocation
operations in parellel?
