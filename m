No need to be sorry ;) And in any case, you're corrrect here.

and eventually:

	fc->s_fs_info = mp;

Ok, yup, I see.  so I guess we kind of have:

*parsing_mp = fc->s_fs_info;

and 

*current_mp = XFS_M(fc->root->d_sb);

(variable names not actually in the code, just used for example)

Sorry for the noise, my mistake!
