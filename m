Didn't this involve custom functionality? I thought they had posted
something at one point that wasn't seen through to merge, but I could be
misremembering (or maybe that was something else RT related). It doesn't
matter that much as there are probably other users out there, but I'm
not sure this serves as a great example use case if it did require
downstream customizations that aren't going to be generalized/supported
for the community.. Richard..?
