Let me take it for a short spin in out xfs stable test environment, since
this env has caught one regression with an allegedly safe fix.
This env has also VMs with old xfsprogs, which is kind of important to
test since those LTS patches may end up in distros with old xfsprogs.

If all is well, I'll send your patch later today to stable maintainers
with this first for-5.10 series.

Damn! this patch slipped through my process (even though I did see
the correspondence on the list).

My (human) process has eliminated the entire 38 patch series
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20210603052240.171998-1-david@fromorbit.com/
without noticing the fix that was inside it.

I did read every cover letter carefully for optimization series that I
eliminated
to look for important fixes and more than once I did pick singular fix patches
from optimization/cleanup series.

In this case, I guess Dave was not aware of the severity of the bug fixed
when he wrote the cover letter(?), but the fact that the series is not only
an improvement was not mentioned.

It's good that we have many vectors to find stable fixes :)

Cheers,
Amir.
