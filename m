The wrappers were a necessary part of the conversion. They should
have been merged with the rest of XFS_IOC_FSGEOMETRY changes. How
did this get broken up?

Don't need to care about dump/restore:

$ git grep FSGEOM
common/fs.c:    if (ioctl(fd, XFS_IOC_FSGEOMETRY_V1, &geo)) {
doc/CHANGES:      XFS_IOC_FSGEOMETRY instead of XFS_IOC_GETFSUUID ioctl, so
$

It only uses teh V1 ioctl.

As it is, the correct thing to do here is to put the fallback into
the xfsctl() function. This is actually an exported and documented
interface to use xfs ioctls by external problems - it's part of
libhandle(), and that should be obvious by the fact the man page
that describes all this is xfsctl(3).

i.e. any app using XFS ioctls should be using the xfsctl()
interface, not calling ioctl directly. The whole reason for that it
because it allows us to handle things like this in application
independent code....
 
So I'd suggest that the fallback code should be in the xfsctl
handler and then userspace will pick this up and won't care about
which kernel it is running on...

I suspect the bigger picture is to convert all the open ioctl()
calls in xfsprogs for XFS specific ioctls to xfsctl(). We've kinda
screwed this pooch since we stopped having to support multiple
platforms.

Or you should be linked against libhandle and using xfsctl() to
be isolated from these sorts of things.

Cheers,

Dave.
