I think it's not difficult to implement this behavior in xfstests. Generally if
a case covers a known bug, we record the patch commit in case description.

As my habit, if a test case fails, I'd like to read the case source code
directly, to get more details about the failure, and check if there's a known
issue(commit id) covered by that. If there is, check if the kernel I'm testing
contains this commit.

From my experience, if a case fails as it's expect, that's easy to find out,
if the comments is good. Print a hint will help, but won't help much I think,
due to the hint is just a guess, we still need to read source code or do more
testing to make sure that, when we hit a failure first time. But most of time
we always hit unexpected failures, that takes longer time to check.

In my testing on RHEL (downstream), I record and update known issues, include known
failures and panic/hang issues (need to skip) for each RHEL release. Before running
xfstests, I try to get a skip list for a specified RHEL/kernel version. Then compare
with its known failures after testing done, to decide if a failure is known/unknown.
Also I created version tags for my redhat internal xfstests repo, for some downstream
of downstream kernel testing (likes Z-stream testing) can use fixed xfstests version.

Some known issue format I record as below[1], a bash script will help to parse it and
compare with testing results. It's only for our internal use, due to I think it's too
crude to be shared :-P

$ cat known_results/$distro/xfs/145.json 
[
    {
        "DESCRIPTION": "bz19483*** XFS: Assertion failed: dqp->q_res_bcount >= be64_to_cpu(dqp->q_core.d_bcount)",
        "FS": ["xfs"],
        "DMESG": "Assertion failed: dqp->q_res_bcount >= be64_to_cpu\\(dqp->q_core.d_bcount\\)",
        "FIXED": true
    }
]
$ cat known_results/$distro/generic/417.json 
[
    {
        "DESCRIPTION": "bz16255*** (<1%): XFS corruption attribute entry #0 in attr block 0, inode 674 is INCOMPLETE",

I prefer generic testing too :)

I'm not sure what other filesystems think about this behavior. If this's a standard
or most common behavior, I hope it can be a generic test (then let other fs maintainers
worry about their new testing failure:-P). Likes generic/673 was written for XFS,
then btrfs found failure, then btrfs said XFS should follow VFS as btrfs does :)
