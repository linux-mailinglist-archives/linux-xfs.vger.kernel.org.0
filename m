I just put an #ifdef __KERNEL__ in the userspace code, like we
have in userspace libxfs/xfs_btree.c for the btree split hand-off
code.

You mean tools/libxfs-diff? I'm not sure that's a simple thing to do
because of the #else cases that go along with define in
xfs_btree.c. Is there really enough noise from libxfs-diff at the
moment that this is actually a problem?

As it is, my longer term plan it to actually properly support things
like spinlocks, atomics, rcu, etc in xfsprogs via pthread and
liburcu wrappers defined in include/<foo.h> that are xfsprogs wide.
At that point, the wrappers in libxfs/libxfs_priv.h then simply
disappear.

I'd prefer we move towards proper support for these primitives
rather than just rearranging how we mock them up...

Cheers,

Dave.
