What is this "atomic block size" going to be, and how is it going to
be advertised to the block layer and filesystems?

So, as I said, your agreeing that an atomic write is essentially a
variant of a data integrity write but has more strict size and
alignment requirements and a normal RWF_DSYNC write?

I really don't care what the impact on the SSD firmware size or
speed is - if the hardware can't guarantee atomic writes right down
to the physical media with full data integrity guarantees, and/or
doesn't advertise it's atomic write limits to the OS and filesystem
then it's simply not usable.

Please focus on correctness of behaviour first - speed is completely
irrelevant if we don't have correctness guarantees from the
hardware.

Atomic writes have nothing to do with individual files. Either the
device under the filesystem can do atomic writes or it can't. What
files we do atomic writes to is irrelevant; What we need to know at
the filesystem level is the alignment and size restrictions on
atomic writes so we can allocate space appropriately and/or reject
user IO as out of bounds.

i.e. we already have size and alignment restrictions for direct IO
(typically single logical sector size). For atomic direct IO we will
have a different set of size and alignment restrictions, and like
the logical sector size, we need to get that from the hardware
somehow, and then make use of it in the filesystem appropriately.

Ideally the hardware would supply us with a minimum atomic IO size
and alignment and a maximum size. e.g. minimum might be the
physical sector size (we can always do atomic physical sector
size/aligned IOs) but the maximum is likely going to be some device
internal limit. If we require a minimum and maximum from the device
and the device only supports one atomic IO size can simply set
min = max.

Then it will be up to the filesystem to align extents to those
limits, and prevent user IOs that don't match the device
size/alignment restrictions placed on atomic writes...

But, first, you're going to need to get sane atomic write behaviour
standardised in the NVMe spec, yes? Otherwise nobody can use it
because we aren't guaranteed the same behaviour from device to
device...

Cheers,

Dave.
