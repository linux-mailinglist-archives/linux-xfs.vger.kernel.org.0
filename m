Which I didn't see any callers do, so I ignored that possibility.
Regardless, it's the use of "|" to do an additive mask match that
makes it look wierd. i.e.  the normal way of writing a multi-biti
mask match is to apply the mask and check that the returned value
matches the mask, like so:

	if ((cur->bc_levels[lev].ra & lr) == lr)
		return 0;

Really, though, this was just another "ObHuh" comment, and you don't
need to "fix" it now...

Nice. Thanks!

Yup, true, long ptrs and inodes are currently interchangable so it
works, but that's a landmine waiting to pounce....

*nod*.
