Nope, the transactions all hit the CIL throttle within a couple of
hundred microseconds of each other, then the CIL push schedules, and
then a couple of hundred microseconds later they are unblocked
because the CIL push has started.

I don't think it will create any new contention points - the
contention I described above can be triggered without the CIL
throttle in place, too. It just requires enough concurrent
transactions to exhaust the entire log reservation, and then we go
from a lockless grant head reservation algorithm to a spinlock
serialised waiting algorithm.  i.e. the contention starts when we
have enough concurrency to fall off the lockless fast path.

So with a 2GB log and fast storage, we likely need a sustained
workload of tens of thousands of concurrent transaction reservations
to exhaust log space and drive us into this situation. We generally
don't have applications that have this sort of concurrency
capability...

Cheers,

Dave.
