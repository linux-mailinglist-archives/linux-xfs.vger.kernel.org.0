Hmmm so if I'm understanding you correctly: you want to define
"capacity" to mean "maximum number of blocks available to userspace"?

Does that available block count depend on privilege level (ala ext4
which always hides 5% of the blocks for root)?  I think the answer to
that is 'no' because you're really just reporting the number of LBAs in
that zone that are available to /any/ application program, and there's a
direct mapping from 'available LBAs in a zone' to 'rgblocks available in
a rtgroup'.

But yeah, I agree that it might be nice to know total blocks available
in a particular rtgroup.  Is it useful to track and report the number of
unwritten blocks remaining in that group?

For example, if the rtgroup size is 1024 fsblocks, the zns zone actually
only has 8000 lba == 1000 fsblocks, and you've already written to 200
fsblocks of it, then we'd report:

rg_length: 1024
rg_capacity: 1000
rg_avail: 800

Here the program knows that every 1000*4k bytes it writes will result in
a jump to a new rtgroup; and that the next time this will happen is
after it writes 800*4k bytes more?  (Assume the usual frictionless
system with no other writers :P)
