They tend to just run in a loop until either no more inodes are to
be found or an error occurs. bulkstat loops don't expect errors to
be reported - it's hard to do something based on all inodes if you
get errors reading then inodes part way through. There's no way for
the application to tell where it should restart scanning - the
bulkstat iteration cookie is controlled by the kernel, and I don't
think we update it on error.

e.g. see fstests src/bstat.c and src/bulkstat_unlink_test*.c - they
simply abort if bulkstat fails. Same goes for xfsdump common/util.c
and dump/content.c - they just error out and return and don't try to
continue further.

Hence returning -EOVERFLOW because the extent count is greater than
what can be held in the struct bstat will stop those programs from
running properly to completion.

Cheers,

Dave.
