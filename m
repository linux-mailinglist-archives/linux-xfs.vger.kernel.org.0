Let me just mark this regression as resolved in the tracking then; this
is, well, clearly not your typical every day regression and at the same
time something your clearly work on resolving, hence not really worth
tracking, as there are bigger fish to fry.

#regzbot inconclusive: pretty special regression; fix for part of it now
in -next, work ongoing to solve other parts (see discussion)

Definitely; don't worry, I noticed that, otherwise I'd have made more
noise early. :-D

Yeah, and many other developers are good as this as well; that's why I
don't even add some regressions to the tracking I notice. And I'm also
well aware that I only notice some regressions once Linus mainlines a fix.

But nevertheless my tracking helps in quite a few cases, as developers
sometimes are humans and let things fall through the cracks. And there
always have and still are developers and subsystems are not as good as
XFS and don't handle regressions like Linus wants them to be handled. I
also help reporters to reach the right developers and improve their bug
reports (e.g. by telling them to bisect and things like that). Guess all
that is why Linus and Greg apparently seem happy about my work.

That being said: there still a lot of room for improvements, but it's a
start.

Then you lost your bet. ;) I can even prove that I saw the "[PATCH,
STABLE 6.3.x] xfs: fix livelock in delayed allocation at ENOSPC" mail
https://fosstodon.org/@kernellogger/110446215848501171

But I'm pretty sure I was aware of it earlier already and decided to not
interfere, as you clearly were working on it with the required priority
(thx for that, btw).

I'm not getting into that discussion. Convince Linus and Greg that my
work is not worth it at all; if it hear it from them I'll stop.

Ciao, Thorsten
