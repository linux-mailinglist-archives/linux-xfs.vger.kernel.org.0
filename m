OK, if you persist, my personal opinion is: at least don't change the
original test logic of other fs especially when they're not wrong but
the change is a little tricky.

For example (not tested):

  shutdown_cmd="shutdown"
  # shutdown the underlying fs if there is
  shutdown_handle="$(_scratch_shutdown_handle)"
  if [ "$shutdown_handle" != "$SCRATCH_MNT" ];then
          shutdown_cmd="\"open $shutdown_handle\" -c shutdown -c close"
  fi
  $XFS_IO_PROG -x -c "mmap 0 4k" -c "mwrite 0 4k" -c ${shutdown_cmd}
          -c fsync -c "mwrite 0 4k" $file | _filter_xfs_io
