Right.

I was about to say that we need freeze protection to prevent fsfreeze
and inumbers/bulkstat stalling each other out on the buffer LRU, but
then I remembered that Brian changed freeze to wait for IO to complete
without dumping the buffer cache this cycle.  So, I don't think freeze
protection is necessary anymore.

How does that sound?

I'm merely playing whackamole with tree walks here.  I would guess that
quotacheck will be next for evaluation.

It also occurs to me that inumbers/bulkstat should probably not be
calling copy_to_user() separately for every single record.
