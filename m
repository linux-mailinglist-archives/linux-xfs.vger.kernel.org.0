Same.. I agree with Christoph on not just ino_discovery, but the various
boolean parameters to some of the common scanning functions that are
reused across multiple phases. It's confusing to track when reading the
code as well as to identify intent and whether certain hunks of
idempotent code are running multiple times, etc.

That said, I'm not necessarily convinced that replacing the booleans
with a phase enum is a huge benefit. That just changes the interface so
it's easier to determine what phase we're in vs. why certain bits of
logic are executed. I.e., 'if (ino_discovery) { do_discovery_stuff(); }'
confuses what phase we're in when reading the lower level code, but 'if
(phase == PHASE_3) { do_discovery_stuff() }' doesn't really clarify how
do_discovery_stuff() might interact with other behaviors that are part
of the same phase.

I'm not sure what the right answer is but if we're going to look at
refactoring things, I'd rather see us start with considering something
more fundamental. For example, could we perhaps factor out the the phase
specific functionality into phase specific functions via an approach
like Darrick's recent log recovery rework?  That way it might be easier
to read through each phase and understand the core repair logic vs.
having to troll through scanning infrastructure multiple times trying to
keep track of where you are in the grand scheme of things. Of course if
that is too much of a mess then perhaps the phase enum thing makes more
sense..
