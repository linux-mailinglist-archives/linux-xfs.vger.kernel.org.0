Not sure I follow. Does this mean we're basically looking at sparse
files as "suspect" because we'd expect them to have extents? Why are we
looking at i_size here instead of fork size like for the attr fork, for
example? Either way it sounds like we're getting into some twisty repair
logic so perhaps this is beyond the scope of Christoph's patches..
