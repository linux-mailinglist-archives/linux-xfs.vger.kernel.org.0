Hmm, /me wonders about the other xfs_bmapi_write cases (remote attrs,
dir/attr allocations, and symlinks) which pass in a nonzero @total?  I
guess those are metadata so we have no alignment requirements and
over-reserving isn't a huge deal?

I also wonder if the xfs_bmapi_write call in xfs_iomap_write_unwritten
needs the same treatment, but the resblks calculation inexplicably(?)
doubles itself.  Not sure why, since in the "splitting the middle of an
extent" case we hold the ilock across both insertions, and one split
should leave us with two half-full leaves, right?  (Maybe this is its
own investigate-and-fix patch...)

<shrug> In the mean time, this part looks ok.
