Subject: [PATCH v2 00/54] fs: rework inode reference counting

v1: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/cover.1755806649.git.josef@toxicpanda.com/

v1->v2:
- Fixed all the things that Christian pointed out.
- Re-ordered some of the patches to the front in case Christian wants to take
  those first.
- Added a new patch for reading the current i_count and propagated that
  everywhere.
- Fixed the cifs build breakage.
- Removed I_REFERENCED since it's no longer needed.
- Remove I_LRU_ISOLATING since it's no longer needed.
- Reworked the drop_nlink/clear_nlink part to simply remove the inode from the
  LRU in the unlink path, and made this its own patch to make the behavior
  change clear.
- NOTE: I'm re-running fstests on this now, there was a slight issue with
  removing the drop_nlink/clear_nlink patch and so I had to add the unlink/rmdir
  patch to resolve it. I assume everything will be fine but just an FYI.
- NOTE #2: I reordered stuff, and I did a rebase and rebuild at every step, but
  I noticed this morning I still missed an odd rebase artifact, so by all means
  validate I didn't make any silly mistakes on the in-between patches.

Hello,

This series is the first part of a larger body of work geared towards solving a
variety of scalability issues in the VFS.

We have historically had a variety of foot-guns related to inode freeing.  We
have I_WILL_FREE and I_FREEING flags that indicated when the inode was in the
different stages of being reclaimed.  This lead to confusion, and bugs in cases
where one was checked but the other wasn't.  Additionally, it's frankly
confusing to have both of these flags and to deal with them in practice.

However, this exists because we have an odd behavior with inodes, we allow them
to have a 0 reference count and still be usable. This again is a pretty unfun
footgun, because generally speaking we want reference counts to be meaningful.

The problem with the way we reference inodes is the final iput(). The majority
of file systems do their final truncate of a unlinked inode in their
->evict_inode() callback, which happens when the inode is actually being
evicted. This can be a long process for large inodes, and thus isn't safe to
happen in a variety of contexts. Btrfs, for example, has an entire delayed iput
infrastructure to make sure that we do not do the final iput() in a dangerous
context. We cannot expand the use of this reference count to all the places the
inode is used, because there are cases where we would need to iput() in an IRQ
context  (end folio writeback) or other unsafe context, which is not allowed.

To that end, resolve this by introducing a new i_obj_count reference count. This
will be used to control when we can actually free the inode. We then can use
this reference count in all the places where we may reference the inode. This
removes another huge footgun, having ways to access the inode itself without
having an actual reference to it. The writeback code is one of the main places
where we see this. Inodes end up on all sorts of lists here without a proper
reference count. This allows us to protect the inode from being freed by giving
this an other code mechanisms to protect their access to the inode.

With this we can separate the concept of the inode being usable, and the inode
being freed.  The next part of the patch series is to stop allowing for inodes
to have an i_count of 0 and still be viable.  This comes with some warts. The
biggest wart is now if we choose to cache inodes in the LRU list we have to
remove the inode from the LRU list if we access it once it's on the LRU list.
This will result in more contention on the lru list lock, but in practice we
rarely have inodes that do not have a dentry, and if we do that inode is not
long for this world.

With not allowing inodes to hit a refcount of 0, we can take advantage of that
common pattern of using refcount_inc_not_zero() in all of the lockless places
where we do inode lookup in cache.  From there we can change all the users who
check I_WILL_FREE or I_FREEING to simply check the i_count. If it is 0 then they
aren't allowed to do their work, othrwise they can proceed as normal.

With all of that in place we can finally remove these two flags.

This is a large series, but it is mostly mechanical. I've kept the patches very
small, to make it easy to review and logic about each change. I have run this
through fstests for btrfs and ext4, xfs is currently going. I wanted to get this
out for review to make sure this big design changes are reasonable to everybody.

The series is based on vfs/vfs.all branch, which is based on 6.9-rc1. Thanks,

Josef
