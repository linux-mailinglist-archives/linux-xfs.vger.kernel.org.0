Yup.

It is not a legal ichange if it moves the root inode to a new
location. IOWs, if the alignment mods will result in the root inode
changing location, then it should be rejected by the kernel.

Anyway, we need more details about your test environment, because
the example you gave:

| # mkfs
| mkfs.xfs -f -K -p /etc/zadara/xfs.protofile -d sunit=64,swidth=64 -l sunit=32 /dev/vda
| 
| #mount with a different sunit/swidth:
| mount -onoatime,sync,nouuid,sunit=32,swidth=32 /dev/vda /mnt/xfs
| 
| #umount
| umount /mnt/xfs
| 
| #xfs_repair
| xfs_repair -n /dev/vda
| # reports false corruption and eventually segfaults[1]

Does not reproduce the reported failure on my workstation running
v5.3.0 kernel and a v5.0.0 xfsprogs:

$ sudo mkfs.xfs -f -d file,name=1t.img,size=1t,sunit=64,swidth=64 -l sunit=32

         =                       sunit=4      swidth=4 blks
....
$

So reducing the sunit doesn't necessarily change the root inode
location, and so in some cases reducing the sunit doesn't change
the root inode location, either.

From the above, it's not clear where the problem lies - it may be
that there's a bug in repair we've fixed since whatever version you
are using....

... hence I'd suggest that more investigation needs to be done
before you do anything permanent...

Cheers,
