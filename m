Heh, sorry, this is another erroneous comment based on me thinking that
xfs_metadump_header would be followed by an array of xfs_meta_extent,
like how v1 does things.  Question withdrawn.

Yes, please.

<nod> I get that, but I'm asking about declaring in the
xfs_metadump_header that eventually there will be an xfs_meta_extent
with XME_ADDR_LOG_DEVICE in it.

The scenario that I'm thinking about is on the mdrestore side of things.
mdrestore reads its CLI arguments, but it doesn't know if the log device
argument is actually required until it reads the metadump header.

Once it has read the metadump header, it ought to be able to tell the
user "This metadump has external log contents but you didn't pass in
--log-device=/dev/XXX" and error out before actually writing anything.

What I think we ought to avoid is the situation where mid-stream we
discover a meta_extent with XME_ADDR_LOG_DEVICE set and only /then/
error out, having already written a bunch of stuff to the data device.
