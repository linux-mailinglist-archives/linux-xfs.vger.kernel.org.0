I just found that reserving an extra XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT(mp) extent count,
when performing a directory insert operation, would not prevent us from ending
up with a directory which can never be deleted.

Let x be a directory's data fork extent count and lets assume its value to be,

x = MAX_EXT_COUNT - XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT(mp)

So in this case we do have sufficient "extent count" to be able to perform a
directory entry remove operation. But the directory remove operation itself
can cause extent count to increase by XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT(mp) units in the
worst case. This happens when freeing 5 dabtree blocks, one data block and one
free block causes file extents to be split for each of the above mentioned
blocks.

If on the other hand, the current value of 'x' were,

x = MAX_EXT_COUNT - (2 * XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT(mp))

'x' can still reach MAX_EXT_COUNT if two consecutive directory remove
operations can each cause extent count to increase by
XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT(mp).

IMHO there is no way to prevent a directory from becoming un-deletable
once its data fork extent count reaches close to MAX_EXT_COUNT. The other
choice of not checking for extent overflow would mean silent data
corruption. Hence maybe the former result is better one to go with.

W.r.t xattrs, not reserving an extra XFS_IEXT_ATTR_MANIP_CNT(mp) extent count
units would prevent the user from removing xattrs when the inode's attr fork
extent count value is close to MAX_EXT_COUNT. However, the file and the
associated extents will be removed during file deletion operation.
