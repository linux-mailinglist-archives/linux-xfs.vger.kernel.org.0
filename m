Heh. "can't" was intended there, but after reading it back it is poorly
worded as a double negative. :P Basically it's just saying that
args.total is what restricts AG selection in this corner case.

Yeah, but this branch also (potentially) changes the allocation type.
IIRC, this wasn't relevant to the corner case I was trying to address
with this patch. I basically just wanted to get minlen dropped before
tossing alignment and at the same time didn't want to screw around with
the existing logic that was unrelated (hence the separation of the
minlen update into a new retry as opposed to just reordering code).

That said, the other subthread suggests this patch can be replaced with
more localized fixes to bma.minlen alignment handling code. My original
reproducer of this problem was based on some of the extent allocation
rework bits that have been deferred (rework of the size allocation
mode). I wasn't aware of the bma.minlen alignment logic at the time, so
I may have misanalyzed the problem and my current development tree
doesn't reproduce. I'll make the tweaks to this patch locally in the
event that I run into the problem again when I get back to that work and
if there still happens to be corner cases not covered by the minlen
fixup patch that Carlos has posted..
