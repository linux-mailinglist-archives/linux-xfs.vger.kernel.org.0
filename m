I've taken this, but I hate how the patches apparently got duplicated.
It feels like they should have been a cleanly separated branch that
was just pulled into whoever needed them when they were ready, rather
than applied in two different places.

So this is just a note for future work - duplicating the patches like
this can cause annoyances down the line. No merge issues this time
(they often happen when duplicate patches then have other work done on
top of them), but things like "git bisect" now don't have quite as
black-and-white a situation etc etc.,

("git bisect" will still find _one_ of the duplicate commits if it
introduced a problem, so it's usually not a huge deal, but it can
cause the bug to be then repeated if people revert that one, but
nobody ever notices that the other commit that did the same thing is
still around and it gets back-ported to stable or whatever..)

So part of this is just in general about confusing duplicate history,
and part of it is that the duplication can then cause later confusion.
