Hi Ted,

Now we provide two ways to help to customize testing in fstests:

1)
https://lore.kernel.org/fstests/20230727030529.r4ivp6dmtrht5zo2@zlang-mailbox/T/#mc5cdb59344f4cd681515bf0fab501d7f30f1e263

2)
https://lore.kernel.org/fstests/169033660570.3222210.3010411210438664310.stgit@frogsfrogsfrogs/T/#u

Which one do you like to use? I'd like to hear more review points before I
choose one to merge.

Thanks,
Zorro
