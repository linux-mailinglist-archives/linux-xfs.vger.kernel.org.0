The card claims Mfg. Date or 01/26/20, which is not too old. The last
time the cache protection was tested? No idea.
The BBU status for the card reports battery state optimal.

I'm not exactly sure how long power was out for, but probably less
than an hour. The data center is supposed to have UPS power and
generator power, but a breaker tripped, and we lost power. My guess is
that power was out for less than an hour, and probably more like a few
minutes.

You may be asking questions I'm not sure how to answer. Most of the
settings are default settings. RAID controller was operating in WB
mode. No MD or LVM, just 24 disks in MegaRAID RAID-6 configuration,
then seen by the OS as one device, which was formatted as XFS.

The controller is reporting everything as working, all disks are
Online and Spun Up, and no errors reported as far as I can tell. I did
get ufsexplorer, and it seems to be recovering data, but it will take
days or weeks to recover all of the data. Still would like to know
more of what happened and how to prevent it from happening in the
future, and what would have been the correct sequence of steps I
should have done when encountering a problem like this.

Thanks for all your help!
