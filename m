Or half an hour with sed.

Indeed, not all of them are problematic:

$ git grep "= snprintf" |wc -l
1744
$ git grep "return snprintf"|wc -l
1306

Less than half of them use the return value.

Anything that calls snprintf() without checking the return
value (just to prevent formatting overruning the buffer) can be
converted by search and replace because the behaviour is the
same for both functions in this case.

Further, code written properly to catch a snprintf overrun will also
correctly pick up scnprintf filling the buffer. However, code that
overruns with snprintf()s return value is much more likely to work
correctly with scnprintf as the calculated buffer length won't
overrun into memory beyond the buffer.

And that's likely all of the snprintf() calls dealt with in half an
hour. Now snprintf can be removed.

What's more scary is this:

$ git grep "+= sprintf"  |wc -l
1834

which is indicative of string formatting iterating over buffers with
no protection against the formatting overwriting the end of the
buffer.  Those are much more dangerous (i.e. potential buffer
overflows) than the snprintf problem being fixed here, and those
will need to be checked and fixed manually to use scnprintf().
That's where the really nasty technical debt lies, not snprintf...

Cheers,

Dave.
