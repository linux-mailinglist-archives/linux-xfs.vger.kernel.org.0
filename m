Which leaves the question about when we need to actually do the
accounting needed to fix the bug Brian is trying to fix. Can that be
delayed until we read the AGFs or have an ENOSPC event occur? Or
maybe some other "we are near ENOSPC and haven't read all AGFs yet"
threshold/trigger?

If that's the case, then I'm happy to have this patchset proceed as
it stands under the understanding that there will be follow up to
make the clean, lots of space free mount case avoid reading the the
AG headers.

If it can't be made constrained, then I think we probably need to
come up with a different approach that doesn't require reading every
AG header on every mount...

Cheers,

Dave.
