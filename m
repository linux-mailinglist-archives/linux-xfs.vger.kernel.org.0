Hi, Dave

I realized there may be a problem with my email so you may not receive my
previous reply. So I'm replying to you with another email address, and if
you received my previous reply, you can ignore this email. Thank you very much!

The problem is hard to reproduce, so I added some print and delay
which affects the function line number, so what you pointed out is
right. I will try to avoid these small mistakes.

Yes, I now understand that you are talking about filesystem level context
and log level context, this is the difference between transaction commit
and transaction cancel.

Yes, xfs_inode_item_release() does nothing with XFS_LI_ABORTED inode items.
So it will have the same result as 3c4cb76bce43. when filesystem is shutdown
but log is still running, after transaction cancel, dirty and unlogged inode
item that has been added to bp->b_li_list but isn't in the AIL, would be
flushed to disk via writeback clustering, it will trigger ASSERT above.

If check log shutdown in xfs_trans_cancel(), xfs_trans_free_items() called
must be latter than log shutdown,  dirty and unlogged inode item that isn't
in the AIL can not be flushed to disk via writeback clustering. As far as
context level you said above is concerned, check log shutdown is not a good
solution. As you said xfs_inode_item_release() may need to do more processing
with XFS_LI_ABORTED inode items.
