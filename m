Interesting.. do you recall how much of a difference it made? I don't
see much more than a second or two difference on my test vm, but I
haven't tried any slow arm or 64k page boxes.

Even then, that could be accomplished with a simple calculation of the
2^32 block requirement multiplied against the block size plus some slop
value like 1GB without significantly changing timing. I.e., the whole
big hunk above could be reduced to something like:

# Calculate the fs size based on block size and the number of delalloc blocks we
# must be able to reserve to overflow. Add some room to account for fs
# metadata overhead and round to 512b so losetup doesn't complain.
nr_cows="$(( ( (2 ** 32) / MAXEXTLEN ) + 100 ))"
loop_file_sz=$(( (nr_cows * MAXEXTLEN * blksz * 12 / 10) / 512 * 512 ))

From there, we could either push the _require_fs_space() down after the
mkfs:

# Now that we've formatted the filesystem, make sure the scratch fs has enough
# room for $nr_cows blocks in two files, again allowing for some overhead.
_require_fs_space $SCRATCH_MNT $(( ( 2 * nr_cows * blksz * 12 / 10 ) / 1024 ))

Or if that's too hacky, just enforce a worst case value for the fs
metadata portion of the required space. As mentioned, the difference I
see between 20T and 300T on a 4k scratch dev is ~6MB. fiemap shows most
of that made up as 40 512b extents, which is 20kb. Extrapolate that out
to a 64k scratch fs and we come in under 20MB. ISTM we could just take
add something like 500MB/1GB to the _require_fs_space() calculation
above to account for the 256MB log + all other fs structure and still
allow the test to run in most cases.

Hmmmm.. unless I'm miscalculating, even the nr_cows portion of the
required space only comes out to ~320MB with a 64k scratch dev. Perhaps
we could skip all of this (except for the sizing of the loop file) and
just '_require_fs_space <1GB>' at the top of the test with a couple
lines of comment to document the worst case calculation. That leaves
plenty of extra space and is still small enough that it likely won't
filter out in most test envs. I also don't think we need to push
anything more than the resulting mkfs output to the $seqres.full file,
so altogether that allows us to remove almost a screen full of
calculation cruft from the test (if you account for the huge comment
required to document the calculations).

Ok, I guess I'd just tweak the one liner comments to explain the purpose
of each of these checks rather than reiterate the code. E.g., for the
check above:

# did cow speculative prealloc reserve enough to overflow?

# detect delalloc count overflow via the stat data
