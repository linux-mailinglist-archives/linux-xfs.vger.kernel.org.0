Isn't this already the case today with EX vs. SH iolock?
I guess the answer depends whether or not i_rwsem
starves existing writers in the face of ongoing new readers.
If my memory serves me right, this exact behavior of i_rwsem
is what sparked the original regression report when xfs
moved from i_iolock to i_rwsem [1].

I won't object to getting the best of all worlds, but I have to say,
upfront, this sounds a bit like premature optimization and for
a workload (mixed buffered/dio write) that I don't think anybody
does in practice and nobody should care how it performs.
Am I wrong?

For all practical purposes, we could maintain a counter in inode
not for submitted DIO, but for files opened O_DIRECT.

The first open O_DIRECT could serialize with in-flight
buffered writes holding a shared iolock and then buffered writes
could take SH vs. EX iolock depending on folio state and on
i_dio_open_count.

I would personally prefer a simple solution that is good enough
and has a higher likelihood for allocating the development, review
and testing resources that are needed to bring it to the finish line.

Thanks,
Amir.
