The tool I was using tried to find the latest reference in lore
to have the closest reference to what was eventually merged
under the assumption that the last cover letter revision is the
best place to look at for overview.

In this case, however, there was an actual pull request for
the final version, but my tool wasn't aware of this practice yet,
so wasnt look for it.

Yes, as a human I was aware of this correspondence.
As a human I also forgot about it, so having the tool search
the lists for followup by commit id sounds like a good idea.

I will make a note of that.
I wasn't trying to pass judgement on you.
I was trying to analyse what needed fixing in my process as this is
the first time I employed it and this was a case study of something
that went wrong in my process.
forgive me if I got carried away with trying to read your thoughts
about the bug.

Understood.

In the future, if you are writing a cover letter for an improvement
series or internal pull request and you know there is a backport
candidate inside, if you happen to remember to mention it, it would
be of great help to me.

Thanks!
Amir.
