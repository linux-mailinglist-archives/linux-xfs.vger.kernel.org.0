/me stumbles around trying to remember under what circumstances do we
actually scan all the rmaps to make sure there's a corresponding bmap.
I think we're trying to avoid doing it for every file in the filesystem
because it's very slow...

Oh right -- we do that for btree format forks because there are a lot of
extent records and therefore a high(er) chance of something getting
lost; or

We scan all the rmaps for files that have nonzero size but zero extents,
because the (forthcoming) inode fork repair will reset damaged forks
back to extents format with zero extents, and this is how we will
trigger the bmap repair to get the extents mapped back into the file.
