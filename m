The first two times it was in much smaller patch series (5 and 8
patches total).


Also, you probably need to search for commit IDs on the list, too,
because this discussion was held in November about backporting the
fix to 5.10 stable kernels:

Subject: Help deciding about backported patch (kernel bug 214767, 19f4e7cc8197 xfs: Fix CIL throttle hang when CIL space used going backwards)
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/C1EC87A2-15B4-45B1-ACE2-F225E9E30DA9@flyingcircus.io/

I was very aware of the severity of the problem, and I don't need
anyone trying to tell me what I should have been doing 18 months
ago.

It simply wasn't a severe bug. We had one user reporting it, and the
when I found the bug I realised that it was a zero-day thinko in
delayed logging accounting I made back in 2010 (~2.6.38 timeframe,
IIRC).  IOWs, it took 10 years before we got the first indication
there was a deep, dark corner case bug lurking in that code.

The time between first post of the bug fix and merge was about 6
months, so it also wasn't considered serious by anyone at the time
as it missed 2 whole kernel releases before it was reviewed and
merged...

There's been a small handful of user reports of this bug since (e.g
the bz above and the backport discussions), but it's pretty clear
that this bug is not (and never has been) a widespread issue.  It
just doesn't fit any of the criteria for a severe bug.

Backport candidate: yes. Severe: absolutely not.

-Dave.
