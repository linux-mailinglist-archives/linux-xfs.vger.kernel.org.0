Hi all,

In preparation for landing the online fs repair feature, it was
necessary to design a generic btree bulk loading module that it could
use.  Fortunately, xfs_repair has four of these (for the four btree
types), so I synthesized one generic version and pushed it into the
kernel libxfs in 5.7.

That being done, port xfs_repair to use the generic btree bulk loader.
In addition to dropping a lot of code from xfs_repair, this also enables
us to control the fullness of the tree nodes in the rebuilt indices for
testing.

For v5 I rebased the support code from my kernel tree, and fixed some
of the more obvious warts that Brian found in v4.

If you're going to start using this mess, you probably ought to just
pull from my git trees, which are linked below.

This is an extraordinary way to destroy everything.  Enjoy!
Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
