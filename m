This seems like all good information for a commit log description or
perhaps to land in a common header where some of these fs context bits
are declared, but overly broad for a function header comment for an XFS
callback. I'd more expect some information around the fundamental
difference between 'mp' and 'new_mp,' where those come from, what they
mean, etc. From the code, it seems like new_mp is transient and reflects
changes that we need to incorporate in the original mp..?
