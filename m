Just merge what we've already got, then do an audit to check for
anything that is missing and then commit them.

So long as it is converted before the release point it doesn't
matter. We don't have extent counts of > 2*32 out in the wild yet,
so as long as the conversions are all sorted by the time 5.19 is
done then it just doesn't matter how many commits it takes because
users won't be using the dev tree to repair filesystems with extent
counts that could overflow a 32 bit counter....

Cheers,

Dave.
