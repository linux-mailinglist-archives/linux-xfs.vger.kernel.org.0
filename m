Hi Chandan,

Please pull this branch with changes for xfs for 6.8-rc1.

As usual, I did a test-merge with the main upstream branch as of a few
minutes ago, and didn't see any conflicts.  Please let me know if you
encounter any problems.

xfs: don't allow overly small or large realtime volumes (2023-12-06 18:45:17 -0800)

----------------------------------------------------------------
xfs: fix realtime geometry integer overflows [v2]

While reading through the realtime geometry support code in xfsprogs, I
noticed a discrepancy between the sb_rextslog computation used when
writing out the superblock during mkfs and the validation code used in
xfs_repair.  This discrepancy would lead to system failure for a runt rt
volume having more than 1 rt block but zero rt extents in length.  Most
people aren't going to configure a 1M extent size for their 360k rt
floppy disk volume, but I did!

In the process of studying that code, it occurred to me that there is a
second bug in the computation -- the use of highbit32 for a 64-bit
value means that the upper 32 bits are not considered in the search for
a high bit.  This causes the creation of a realtime summary file that is
the wrong length.  If rextents is a multiple of U32_MAX then this will
appear to work fine because highbit32 returns -1 for an input of 0; but
for all other cases the rt summary is undersized, leading to failures.

Fix the first problem by standardizing the computation with a helper in
libxfs; and the second problem by correcting the computation.  This will
cause any existing rt volumes larger than 2^32 blocks to fail validation
but they probably were already crashing anyway.

v2: pick up review tags

This has been lightly tested with fstests.  Enjoy!
