Histograms are probably the best way to demonstrate the general
distribution of the data set. Average/median don't really convey
much other than whether the dataset is skewed to one end or another,
while histograms will give us a good indication in the change of
"distance from target" over a wide range of the filesystem. It can
even incorporate "skipped AG" as a bucket to indicate how often
thatis occurring and whether the change in algorithms
increase/decreases the occurence of that.

FWIW, I suspect a histogram that describes "extent size vs locality
of next extent" will give us an idea of whether small or large
allocations have worse locality. I'd also expect a measure like this
to give insight into how badly free space fragmentation is affecting
the filesystem, as it will tend to push the extent size distribution
towards the smaller end of the scale....

See how the freesp commands work in xfs_db - they just generate a
set of {offset, size} tuples that are then bucketted appropriately.
This is probably the best way to do this at the moment - have xfs_db
walk the inode BMBTs outputting something like {extent size,
distance to next extent} tuples and everything else falls out from
how we bucket that information.

The nullfb case isn't the problem here - I think the problem comes
when we fail the THIS_BNO/NEAR_BNO allocation attempts in
xfs_bmap_btalloc() and then fall back to XFS_ALLOCTYPE_START_BNO
with the same fsbno target.

Hmmm. I think you just pointed out a bug in this code. The initial
NEARBNO alloc sets ->min_agbno and ->max_agbno based on the
args->agbno, which xfs_alloc_compute_aligned then uses to determine
if the found free extent can be used. When we immediately fall back
to XFS_ALLOCTYPE_THIS_AG allocation, we don't reset
min_agbno/max_agbno, and so even though we ignore the args->agbno
target that is set when selecting a free extent, we still call
xfs_alloc_compute_aligned() to determine if it is appropriate to
use.

I think the bug here is that xfs_alloc_compute_aligned() applies the
NEARBNO args->min_agbno to the free extent found by the THIS_AG
allocation, and so if the large free extent in the new AG overlaps
min_agbno it selects the higher up part of the free extent that
starts at min_agbno, rather than using the start of the free
extent...

Of course, I could be missing something obvious (still haven't
finished my morning coffee!), so it's worth checking I read the code
properly....

Cheers,

Dave.
