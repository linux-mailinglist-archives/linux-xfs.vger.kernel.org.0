IOWs letting the wrong threads run ahead, to see if the author got the
locking right.

Admittedly there are some fun things that you can do in the kernel that
you can't do from userspace, like create a secret unlinked file that you
can map freespace into, and turn EFIs into a bmapi operation, and
reflink file blocks into without having to deal with eof blocks, and
turning on alwayscow for files you're actively trying to move around.
But that's a fun thing to think about now that I have far fewer patches
to juggle in my head, for which I am grateful. :)
