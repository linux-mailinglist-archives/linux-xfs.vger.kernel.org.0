Confirmed that it made it into 5.10.y and that
2719c7160dcf ("vfs: make freeze_super abort when sync_filesystem returns error")
also made it to both 5.10.y and 5.15.y

That's not all.
There are also Christian's vfstest tests that also check SGID with
and without idmapped mounts.
This is especially important for 5.15.y which has idmapped mounts
support.

Anyway, as agreed, we are dropping this patch for this round.
So let's talk procedure -
You got Acked-by from Darrick for the entire series minus this one patch,
so according to earlier request, please post the v3 diminished series
of the 5.15 CANDIDATE to xfs list with Darrick's Acked-by on all patches,
to allow developers to see the series in its final form before posting
to stable.

The cover letter should list the Changes since v2 to express the dropped
patch.

I don't know what's the customary time to wait for "last notice before merge"
but I would say you can send your series to stable in a day or two if there
are no last minute comments.

Anyway, the post to stable is also public (don't forget to cc xfs list) and
after patches are queued to stable there is also time for developers
to object. (stable process sends emails to patch authors and reviewers
before merging them).

I suggest for convention, that the post to stable be tagged as v4
with CANDIDATE prefix removed and the changelog looking
something like this:

Changes since v3:
- Post to stable

Changes from v2:
- Drop SGID fix
- Added Acks from Darrick

Changes from v1:
(https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220603184701.3117780-1-leah.rumancik@gmail.com/):
- Increased testing
- Reduced patch set to overlap with 5.10 patches

I will follow the same procedure for 5.10 series as soon as all
of Darrick's concerns will be addressed.

Thanks,
Amir.
