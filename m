The two cases in that bug look very similar, and are on similar 
hardware, and they also look (to me) like different problems than the 
one reported here.

Those reporters are reading garbage data from disk, this one seems to be 
in-memory corruption of an inode down a xfs_free_eofblocks() path...

I could be wrong, but I'm not seeing a connection between this report 
and the bugzilla report, at first glance.

Thanks,
