The flush that occurs just before xfs_truncate_page() during a
non-extending truncate exists to avoid potential stale data exposure
problems when iomap zeroing might be racing with buffered writes
over unwritten extents. However, we've had reports of this causing
significant performance regressions on overwrite workloads where the
flush serves no correctness purpose. For example, the uuidd
mechanism stores time metadata to a file on every generation
sequence. This involves a buffered (over)write followed by a
truncate of the file to its current size. If these uuids are used as
transaction IDs for a database application, then overall performance
can suffer tremendously by the repeated flushing on every truncate.

To avoid this problem, update the truncate path to only flush in
scenarios that are known to conflict with iomap zeroing. iomap skips
zeroing when it sees a hole or unwritten extent, so this essentially
means the filesystem should flush if either of those scenarios have
outstanding dirty pagecache and can skip the flush otherwise.

The ideal longer term solution here is to avoid the need to flush
entirely and allow the zeroing to detect a dirty page and zero it
accordingly, but this is a bit more involved in that it may involve
the iomap interface. The purpose of this change is therefore to
prioritize addressing the performance regression in a straightfoward
enough manner that it can be separated from further improvements.
