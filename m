This really makes the semantics clearer. So the assignment condition for
rec_daddr = info->end_daddr also needs to be changed.

A more detailed explanation, indeed. As for my previous description, I
simply explained that it would be missed, but did not say the specific
reason. I will adopt it in the next patch, thanks.

I actually have a question here. We set info->low.rm_blockcount with
keys[0].fmr_length to indicate if this is the first fsmap query. But I'm
not sure what keys[1].fmr_length does. When fsmap is invoked in user
mode, keys[1].fmr_physical is only set. In view of this, I hope to get
your answer.

Anyway, I will send the next patch as soon as possible, thanks for your
comments.

Thanks,
