Hi all,

Back in 2021, I amended the xfs create-a-filesystem helper code to
support the generation of compressed metadumps.  Unfortunately, I
neglected to submit the other half of that code which detects a
*compressed* metadump file and uses it, which means that the metadump
caching used by all the xfs fuzz tests have been broken ever since, but
only if DUMP_COMPRESSOR is set by the user.

Fast-forward to 2022, and I noticed that fuzz tests runs would
occasionally complain about POPULATE_METADUMP not pointing to a valid
file if DUMP_COMPRESSOR is set, and no dump file exists, compressed or
uncompressed.  After some curious looks from Zorro, I finally realized
that POPULATE_METADUMP points to the uncompressed file, so checking for
its existence is not correct.

Hence port all the code that fixed mdrestore of compressed metadumps
further down the patch stack, and fix the broken conditional to get
things running again.

This is an extraordinary way to destroy everything.  Enjoy!
Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
