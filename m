About 20 instructions when the value is zero. The number of racers
will be dependent on how many threads are blocked in commit on the
xc_ctx_lock while a CIL push is in progress. The unit reservation
stolen here for the CIL is:

	xfs_log_calc_unit_res(mp, 0)
		~= 4 * sizeof(xlog_op_header) +
		   sizeof(xlog_trans_header) +
		   sizeof(sector) +
		   log stripe unit roundoff

So for a typical 4k log sector, we are talking about ~6kB of unit
reservation per thread that races here. For a 256k log stripe unit,
then it's going to be about 520kB per racing thread.

That said, every thread that races has this reservation available,
and the amount reserved adds to the space used in the CIL. Hence the
only downside of racing here is that the CIL background pushes
earlier because it hits the threshold sooner. That isn't a huge
issue - if we can't push immediately then the CIL will
run to the hard limit and block commits there; that overrun space is
larger than amount of space "wasted" by racing commits here.

Not really. We need a thundering herd to cause issues, and this
occurs after formatting an item so we won't get a huge thundering
herd even when lots of threads block on the xc_ctx_lock waiting for
a push to complete.

I haven't been able to come up with any adverse side effects except
for "performance might drop a bit if we reserve too much and push
early", but that is tempered by the fact that performance goes up
much more than we might lose by getting rid of the xc_cil_lock
bottleneck.

No, I changed it to apply to any vector length longer than a single
iclog except for transactions that have taken the unit reservation
above.

Sampling the space used isn't accurate here, and we do not want to
be doing an accurate sum across all CPUs, hence trying to detect a
reservation crossing an iclog boundary is difficult. Hence I just
took the reservation for anything that is guaranteed to cross an
iclog boundary.

The len used in the split_res calc guarantees that we always have at
least 1 log and op header accounted for by a split, and if the
vector length is greater than a single iclog it will include a
header for every iclog that the vector may span. i.e. if len >
iclog_space, it will reserve 2 extra iclog headers and op headers as
it may split across 3 iclogs....

Definitely. :)
