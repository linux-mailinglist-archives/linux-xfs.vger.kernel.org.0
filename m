It's checking the required v4 feature flags for v5 filesystems are
set. I'll clarify it on commit, something like:

/*
 * Check that all the V4 feature flags that V5 filesystems
 * require are correctly set.
 */

*nod*. I was just pissed off at having to waste an entire day on
unplanned fuzzer whack-a-mole for yet more "cannot happen in the
real world without malicious tampering" issues.

This one was caused by a fuzzer setting the version number to 5 and
then clearing the dirv2 bit and recalculating the CRC causing the
xfs_da_mount() to fire an assert that the dirv2 bit wasn't set. The
other fuzzed filesystems also had other v4 features bits cleared.
