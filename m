Yes, by all means. I don't want to make it harder to get stuff done,
so moving stuff around at the end of the series is fine...

Ok, that context is missing from the patch series. :/

Yeah, can be difficult. I prefer to err on the side of "complete
change" rather than splitting two parts of a larger work
arbitrarily...

You've got a branch with the full series in it somewhere, I'm
