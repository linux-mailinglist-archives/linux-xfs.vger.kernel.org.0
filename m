Hi folks (mostly Dave),

The scrub-strengthen-rmap-checking branch of the xfs-linux repository at:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/djwong/xfs-linux.git

has just been updated for your review.  These are all the accumulated
fixes for online scrub, as well as the design document for the entire
online fsck effort.

This code snapshot has been rebased against recent upstream, freshly
QA'd, and is ready for people to examine.  For veteran readers, the new
snapshot can be diffed against the previous snapshot; and for new
readers, this is a reasonable place to begin reading.  For the best
experience, it is recommended to pull this branch and walk the commits
instead of trying to read any patch deluge.  Mostly it's tweaks to
naming and APIs that Dave mentioned last week.

The new head of the scrub-strengthen-rmap-checking branch is commit:

d95b1fa39fab xfs: cross-reference rmap records with refcount btrees
