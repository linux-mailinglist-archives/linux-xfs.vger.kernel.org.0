Heh.  I guess question marks seems a bit better, but the general idea
of having new names / different pointing locations show up in the
name space scare me a little.  I wonder if something like the classic
lost+found directory might be the right thing for anything we're not
sure about as people know about it.

Yeah.  But maybe expand the comment a bit - having spent a fair amout
of time with the reflink code this was obvious to me, but for someone
new the above might be a bit too cryptic.

Heh.  Just wanted an explanation for the check.  So a commnt is fine,
or finding a way to use the uid_valid and co helpers to make it
self-explanatory.
