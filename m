Code looks good, so

Reviewed-by: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

But it makes me wonder...

That is, we already elide the call to generic_write_sync() in direct
IO in the case that the device supports FUA and it's a pure
overwrite with no dirty metadata on the inode. Hence for a lot of
storage and AIO/io_uring+DIO w/ O_DSYNC workloads we're already
eliding this fsync-based lock cycle.

In the case where we can't do a REQ_FUA IO because it is not
supported by the device, then don't we really only need a cache
flush at IO completion rather than the full generic_write_sync()
call path? That would provide this optimisation to all the
filesystems using iomap_dio_rw(), not just XFS....

In fact, I wonder if we need to do anything other than just use
REQ_FUA unconditionally in iomap for this situation, as the block
layer will translate REQ_FUA to a write+post-flush if the device
doesn't support FUA writes directly.

You're thoughts on that, Christoph?

Cheers,

Dave.
