There's the bug. The patch I wrote needs to ensure that the quotas
are enabled when attaching the dquot to the dqinfo. The code
currently checks for global "quota on" state, but it doesn't check
individual quota state...

Right, the reservation functions need to do the same thing as
xfs_trans_mod_dquot_byino(). I simply missed that for the
reservation functions. i.e. Adding the same style of check like:

	if (XFS_IS_UQUOTA_ON(mp) && udq)

before doing anything with user quota will avoid this problem as
we are already in transaction context and the UQUOTA on or off state
will not change until the transaction ends.

I can't think of anything that is missing - the quota off barrier
gives us an atomic quota state change w.r.t. running transactions,
so we just need to make sure we check the quota state before joining
anything quota related to a transaction rather than assume that the
presence of a dquot attached to an inode means that quotas are on.

Cheers,

Dave.
