This series is basically ready, but I can't apply it because it depends on the
other patch series
"[PATCH v4 0/9] ensure bios aren't split in middle of crypto data unit"
(https://lkml.kernel.org/linux-block/20210707052943.3960-1-satyaprateek2357@gmail.com/T/#u).
I will be re-reviewing that other patch series soon, but it primary needs review
by the people who work more regularly with the block layer, and it will have to
go in through the block tree (I can't apply it to the fscrypt tree).

The original version of this series didn't require so many block layer changes,
but it would have only allowed direct I/O with user buffer pointers aligned to
the filesystem block size, which was too controversial with other filesystem
developers; see the long discussion at
https://lkml.kernel.org/linux-fscrypt/20200720233739.824943-1-satyat@google.com/T/#u.

In addition, it was requested that we not add features to the "legacy" direct
I/O implementation (fs/direct-io.c), so I have a patch series in progress
"[PATCH 0/9] f2fs: use iomap for direct I/O"
(https://lkml.kernel.org/linux-f2fs-devel/20210716143919.44373-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/T/#u)
which will change f2fs to use iomap.

Also please understand that Satya has left Google, so any further work from him
on this is happening on a personal capacity in his free time.
