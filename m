Ok, I'll add a new private icwalk flag for reclaim callers to indicate
that it's ok to reclaim sick inodes:

	/* Don't reclaim a sick inode unless the caller asked for it. */
	if (ip->i_sick && icw &&
	    (icw->icw_flags & XFS_ICWALK_FLAG_RECLAIM_SICK)) {
		spin_unlock(&ip->i_flags_lock);
		return false;
	}

And then xfs_reclaim_inodes becomes:

void
xfs_reclaim_inodes(
	struct xfs_mount	*mp)
{
	struct xfs_icwalk	icw = {
		.icw_flags	= 0,
	};

	if (xfs_want_reclaim_sick(mp))
		icw.icw_flags |= XFS_ICWALK_FLAG_RECLAIM_SICK;

	while (radix_tree_tagged(&mp->m_perag_tree, XFS_ICI_RECLAIM_TAG)) {
		xfs_ail_push_all_sync(mp->m_ail);
		xfs_icwalk(mp, XFS_ICWALK_RECLAIM, &icw);
	}
}

Similar changes apply to xfs_reclaim_inodes_nr.

Yes.  The subsequent health reporting patchset that I linked a few
responses ago is intended to help with the pinning behavior.  With it,
we'll be able to save the fact that inodes within a given AG were sick
even if we're forced to give back the memory.  At a later time, the
sysadmin can download the health report and initiate a scan that will
recover the specific sick info and schedule downtime or perform repairs.

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/djwong/xfs-linux.git/log/?h=indirect-health-reporting

The trouble is, this is a user ABI change, so I'm trying to keep it out
of the landing path of deferred inactivation.

It already can.  As an example, "xfs_scrub -a 1000 -e shutdown" will
shut down the filesystem after 1,000 errors.

This might be the case anyway.  Remember how I was working on some code
to set sick flags any time we saw a corruption anywhere in the
filesystem?  If that ever gets fully implemented, we could very well end
up pinning tons of memory that will cause the system (probably) to swap
itself to death because we won't let go of the bad inodes.

Done.
