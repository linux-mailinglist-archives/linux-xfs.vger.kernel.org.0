Hmm, so you want to go from:

	union xfs_rtword_ondisk *start, *end, *b;

	start = b = xfs_rbmblock_wordptr(bp, startword);
	end = xfs_rbmblock_wordptr(bp, endword);

	while (b < end) {
		somevalue = xfs_rtbitmap_getword(mp, b);
		somevalue |= somemask;
		xfs_rtbitmap_setword(mp, b, somevalue);
		b++;
	}

	xfs_trans_log_buf(tp, bp, start - bp->b_addr, b - bp->b_addr);

to something like:

	for (word = startword; word <= endword; word++) {
		somevalue = xfs_rtbitmap_getword(mp, b);
		somevalue |= somemask;
		xfs_rtbitmap_setword(mp, bp, word, somevalue);
	}
	xfs_rtbitmap_log_buf(tp, bp, startword, endword);

I think that could be done with relatively little churn, though it's
unfortunate that the second version does 2x(shift + addition) each time
it goes through the loop instead of the pointer increment that the first
version does.
