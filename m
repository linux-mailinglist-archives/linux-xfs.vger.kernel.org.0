Not surprising - the scheduler will select a sibling cores that
share caches when the previous CPU the task was running on is busy
running CPU affine tasks (i.e. the per-cpu inactive kworker thread).

But how many CPUs it bounces the workload around over a long period
is not important. What is important is the cache residency between
the inodes when they are queued and when they are then inactivated.
That's measured in microseconds to single digit milliseconds (i.e.
within a single scheduling tick), and this is the metric that
matters the most. It doesn't matter if the first batch is unlinked
on CPU 1 and then inactived on CPU 1 while the scheduler moves the
unlink task to CPU 2 where it queues the next batch to be
inactivated on CPU 2, and so on. What matters is the data set in
each batch remains on the same CPU for inactivation processing.

The tracing I've done indicates taht the majority of the time that
the scehduler bounces the tasks between two or three sibling CPUs
repeatedly. This occurs when the inactivation is keeping up with the
unlink queueing side. When we have lots of extents to remove in
inactivation, the amount of inactivation work is much greater than
the unlink() work, and so we see inactivation batch processing
taking longer and the CPU spread of the unlink task gets larger
because there are more CPUs running CPU-affine tasks doing
background inactivation.

IOWs, having the number of CPUs the unlink task is scheduled on
grow over the long term is not at all unexpected - this is exactly
what we'd expect to see when we move towards async background
processing of complex operations...

The scheduler will select the next CPU based on phsyical machine
topology - core latencies, shared caches, numa distances, whether
the target CPU has affinity bound tasks already queued, etc.

As long as the context switch rate does not substantially increase,
having tasks migrate between sibling cores every so often isn't a
huge problem.

WE probably could do this, but I'm not sure the complexity is
justified by the rarity of the problem it is trying to avoid.
Freezes are not long term, nor are they particularly common for
performance sensitive workloads. Hence I'm just not this corner case
is important enough to justify doing the work given that we've had
similar freeze-will-delay-some-stuff-indefinitely behaviour for a
long time...

Dave.
