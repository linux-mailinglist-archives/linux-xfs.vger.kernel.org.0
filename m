I think it's important to note that you're calling `blockdev --setro` 
here, which sets the device RO at the block layer...

As mentioned in the commit message, the SSDs we work with are ATA 
devices and there is no such mechanism in the ATA spec to report to the 
block layer that the device is RO. What we run into is this:

xfs_log_mount
     xfs_log_recover
         xfs_find_tail
             xfs_clear_stale_blocks
                 xlog_write_log_records
                     xlog_bwrite

the xlog_bwrite fails and triggers the call to xfs_force_shutdown. In 
this specific scenario, we know the log is clean as XFS_MOUNT_WAS_CLEAN 
is set in the log flags, however the stale blocks cannot be removed due 
to the device being write-protected. the call to xfs_clear_stale_blocks 
cannot be obviated because, as mentioned before, ATA devices do not have 
a mechanism to report that they're read-only.
