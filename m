Yes, it's certainly possible.  I don't want to go opencoding more vfs
methods (like some e4 filesystems do) so I'll propose that as a second
patch for 5.9.

On second thought, I wonder if I should just drop the flush entirely?
It's not a huge burden to skip past the delalloc reservations.

Hmmm.  Any preferences?
