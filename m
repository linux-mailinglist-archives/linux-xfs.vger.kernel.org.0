It's fine, so long as you document it properly in commit message.
See, we are so bad in this review process, that we rely on humans
to verify that logic preserving re-factoring patches are indeed logic
preserving. This is so lame to begin with, because there are static
checker bots out there that would gladly do that work for us :) ...
if we only annotated the logic preserving patches as such.
In the mean while, while we are substituting the review robots,
the least a developer could do is not call out a patch "re-factoring"
and sneak in a logic change without due notice to reviewers.

Thanks,
Amir.
