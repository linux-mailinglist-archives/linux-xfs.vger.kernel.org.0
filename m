IOWs,
xfs_defer_drain_init
      "        _free
      "        _grab
      "        _rele
      "        _busy
      "        _wait
      "        _wait_disable
      "        _wait_enable

?

Should be easy enough to fix.

<nod> That makes sense.  I think newbt.c (in part2) is the only caller
that needs to xfs_perag_intent_hold having already gotten its own perag
reference.

I'll do this afterwards so I can contain the pain of dealing with the
ftrace macro hell to a single patch.

I like how that worked out too. :D

Eventually I think I'd like it even more if we could pass perag ref from
one intent to another instead of yet another xfs_perag_get call, but
that can come later.  I think the only place we need to do that are for
bmap updates and the swapext code.

trace-cmd -e printk to capture the dmesg contents?

Or do you want a specific tracepoint to dump the bad record as an ftrace
thing?

Yes, although I'd like to come up with a better name for ->key_diff at
the same time.

Done.

<nod> I'm hoping the interval trees are fairly bulletproof to off by one
errors.  If nothing else, I haven't found any bugs in here in months.

Yes, that's a much better name.

<nod> I'll paste a version of that into xchk_iget_agi().

I'll think about this tomorrow when my brain is less tired.  These two
functions are nearly the same, but I think the key difference is:

xchk_iget_for_scrubbing passes up -EFSCORRUPTED if the inode cluster
buffer fails the verifier; the incore verifiers (e.g. attr shortform)
fail to load; or the inobt search under the xfs_imap call fails
buffer verifiers.

xchk_setup_inode, on the other hand, ignores EFSCORRUPTED to try to fix
anything that's wrong with the icluster buffer that prevents the inode
cache from loading the inode.

I think those two could be combined, though that would require a flags
argument to switch the behaviors.

I tried to use the filldir code, but it drops the directory ILOCK after
taking the dirent buffer.  This is great for dir_emit since that means
we don't hold ILOCKs while copying things to userspace, but bad for
online fsck because now it has to deal with metadata changing because of
that lock cycling.

I initially thought I could deal with it, but my experiences (especially
with the parent pointers repair code) is that it's /much/ easier to
understand what's going on in repair if we keep the ILOCK for as long as
we possibly can, and document heavily the places where we pick back up
the ILOCK.

You might notice that I did the same thing for listxattr.  There's no
ILOCK cycling going on there, but we don't have to deal with the attr
cursor and whatnot there.  bfoster and I encountered a lot of confusion
trying to make sure all that worked right.
