If only I had a dollar for every time I've deleted a similar rant...

Yup, this seems like a right thing to do given the lack of action
from the userspace side of the fence.

[ The argument that "prompting the user to ask if they trust the
device teaches them to ignore security prompts" is just stupid. We
have persistent identifiers in filesystems - keep a database of
known trusted identifiers and only prompt for "is this a trusted
device" when an unknown device is inserted. Other desktop OS's have
been doing this for years.... ]

Yeah, I turned off all the DE level automount stuff years ago, too.
It's the first thing I do when setting up a new machine for anyone,
too.

I think this is correct, but the lack of documentation on how
udev rules and overrides are supposed to work doesn't help
me one bit.

Ok, just tracked it through - only gvfs and clevis actually look at
udisks_block_get_hint_auto() from udisks, so at least the gnome and
lxde/lxqt desktop environments will no longer automount XFS
filesystems.  Who knows what magic is needed for other DEs, but this
is a good start.
