That implies that a extent tree modification is being made whilst
the delalloc function is holding the ILOCK_EXCL. Either rwsems on
ARM are broken (entirely possible given the subtle memory ordering
of the slow paths has caused this sort of problem on x64-64 multiple
times in the past), or something else isn't holding the ILOCK_EXCL
while modifying the iext tree.

That implies multiple operations occurred - the single leaf won't
split until it is full - that's when we add the 15th record to the
tree. We're nowhere near that. And it won't attempt a rebalance that
may merge the the two leaf nodes until a remove occurs and the
number of entries in that leaf drops to half full (7 entries) and
the combined total is less that a full leaf.

Further, this is the left-most leaf, so any split will allocate a
new right sibling and move the entries right in to the new node. If
either the new right or the left node then rebalance, they will
always merge to the left-most leaf and free the right leaf. IOWs,
a grow-split-shrink-merge on the left most leaf in the tree will not
change the address of that left-most leaf - the right leave will get
allocated then freed...

So I'm not sure that even a grow-split-shrink-merge has occurred
concurrently here.....

Oh.... inserting into the root block of the tree results in
xfs_iext_realloc_root() being called, and krealloc() is called to
grow the root leaf block. that points cur->leaf at the newly
reallocated chunk of memory.

Ok, so the change in cursor is to be expected. There's nothing wrong
with the cursor, or that we have a reallocated the root leaf.

That leaves something not holding the right lock when inserting
a new extent,, or rwsems are broken on ARM.

And there's no such thing a FIEXCHANGE in the upstream current code
base, so that would be a good place to look for shenanigans.... :)
