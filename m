The only thing the unmount record really does is ensure that the
head and tail of the log point to the unmount record. that's what
marks the log clean, not the unmount record itself. We use a special
record here because we're not actually modifying anything - it's not
a transaction, just a marker to get the log head + tail to point to
the same LSN in the log.

Log covering does the same thing via logging and flushing the
superblock multiple times - it makes sure that the only item in the
commit at the head of the journal has a tail pointer that also
points to the same checkpoint. The fact that it's got a "dirty"
unmodified superblock in rather than being an unmount record is
largely irrelevant - the rest of the log has been marked as clean by
this checkpoint and the replay of the SB from this checkpoint is
effectively a no-op.

In fact, I think it's a "no-op" we can take advantage of.....

It's a bit more complex than that - if the log is not dirty, then
the second log force does nothing, and the tail of the log does not
get updated. Hence you have to log, commit and writeback the
superblock twice to ensure that the log tail has been updated in the
journal to after the point in time where the superblock was *first
logged*.

The log covering state machine handles this all correctly, and it
does it using the superblock as the mechanism that moves the tail of
the log forward. I suspect that we could use the second logging of
the superblock in that state machine to clear/set log incompat
flags, as that is the commit that marks the log "empty". If we crash
before the sb write at this point, log recovery will only see the
superblock to recover, so it doesn't matter that there's a change in
log incompat bits here because after recovery we're going to clear
them, right?

I'd like to avoid re-inventing the wheel here if we can :)

Cheers,

Dave.
