I agree, but....

... I'm not prepared to fight this battle to get this initial fix
into the code. Get the fix merged, then we can

It does make things worse - it turns multi-bio chaining loops like
the one xfs_rw_bdev() into an endless loop as they don't make
progress - they just keep allocating a new bio and retrying the same
badly aligned buffer and failing. So if we want an alignment failure
to error out, callers need to handle the failure, not treat it like
a full bio.

Dave.
