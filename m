xfs_inode_item_format() logs the inode core regardless of whether
XFS_ILOG_CORE flag is set in xfs_inode_log_item->ili_fields. Hence, setting
the NREXT64 bit in xfs_dinode->di_flags2 just after reading an inode from disk
should not result in a scenario where the corresponding
xfs_log_dinode->di_flags2 will not have NREXT64 bit set.

If log recovery comes across a log inode with NREXT64 bit set in its di_flags2
field, then we can safely conclude that the ondisk inode has to be updated to
reflect this change i.e. there is no need to compare LSNs of the checkpoint
transaction being replayed and that of the disk inode.

The two structures above result in padding and hence result in a hole being
introduced. The entire union above can be replaced with the following,

        union {
                __be32  di_big_aextcnt; /* NREXT64 attr extents */
                __be32  di_nextents;    /* !NREXT64 data extents */
        };
        union {
                __be16  di_nrext64_pad; /* NREXT64 unused, zero */
                __be16  di_anextents;   /* !NREXT64 attr extents */
        };

To summarize the design,

- We need both the per-inode flag (for satisfying the requirement of
  self-describing metadata) and superblock flag (since an older kernel should
  not be allowed to mount an fs containing inodes with large extent counters).

- When an allocated inode is read from disk, the incore inode's NREXT64 bit in
  di_flags2 field should be set if the superblock has NREXT64 feature enabled.

- Any modification to an inode is guaranteed to cause logging of its di_flags2
  field. Hence xfs_iext_max_nextents() can depend on an inode's di_flags2
  field's NREXT64 bit to determine the maximum extent count.

- Newly allocated inodes will have NREXT64 bit set in di_flags2 field by
  default due to xfs_ino_geometry->new_diflags2 having XFS_DIFLAG2_NREXT64 bit
  set.

Apart from the regular fs operations, the on-disk format changes introduced
above seems to work well with Log replay, Scrub and xfs_repair.
