Heh, ok, more explanation is needed.  How about this?

	/*
	 * If writeback hits EIO or ENOSPC, reflect it back into the
	 * address space mapping so that a writer program calling fsync
	 * to look for errors will still capture the error.
	 *
	 * However, we continue into the extent mapping checks because
	 * write failures do not necessarily imply anything about the
	 * correctness of the file metadata.  The metadata and the file
	 * data could be on completely separate devices; a media failure
	 * might only affect a subset of the disk, etc.
