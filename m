Yes, it is, but that is forced on file systems by the VFS.

I'm not certain this design is needed to support the new
fsopen()/fsconfig()/fsmount() system calls though I think it is
due to the way in which they are called.

For example I don't think the VFS has enough information to obtain
the super block at the time fsconfig() is being called so it must
be deferred until fsmount() and fsconfig() is about parameter parsing.

Yes, but the xfs logging is probably the most important thing that
would be needed prior to calling get_tree_bdev() and that's currently
ok except for the missing block device name.

There may be ways to change this but I'm pretty sure they would cause
fairly significant challenges for the overall design and support of
those new system calls and that's one of the key elements of the new
mount-api.
