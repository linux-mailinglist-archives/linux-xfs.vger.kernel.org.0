Quite frankly, I don't think waiting longer for more review is going
to do much to improve the code further. It's largely unchanged since
the last merge cycle went by when I was already waiting for reviews
and it was considered "not enough time to review in this cycle".
It's got enough reviews now to pass the merge bar, and the only way
we are going to shake any remaining problems with this code out is
to merge it and get it out to a wider testing base....

Indeed, if it is merged now it is going to sit another 3 months in
for-next+rc kernels before it is released to users, so I don't think
having it sit for another 3 months only in my test tree before it
gets wider testing benefits anyone. All it does is slow me down and
start pushing me towards having an entirely unmanageable review
backlog like you already have, Darrick.

Given that our rate-of-merge limitations are largely caused by a
lack of review bandwidth, putting off merging code that has already
met the review bar so it can have "more review" seems like a big
step backwards in terms of working through our review backlog. We
need to review and merge stuff faster, not block more stuff by
trying to make review capture every possible problem before we merge
the code.

So, yeah, if I were maintainer and I saw every patch had a RVB on
it, I'd be merging it straight away. But I'm not the maintainer, so
I'll do whatever you want...

I've fixed the little issues with the last posting, and it ran
through fstests just fine last night, so I'm just about ready to
send you a pull request for this series.

Cheers,

Dave.
