Seems reasonable to me...

Should we not have a (oneshot?) warning for systems that choose to
continue to support and use v4 filesystems? ISTM that's the best way to
ensure there's feedback on this change earlier rather than later, or
otherwise encourage such users to reformat with v5 at the next available
opportunity...

BTW, any reason this is in xfs_readsb() vs. xfs_fc_fill_super() where we
have various other version/feature checks and warnings?
