Until the sysfs code changes. Then it's a landmine that explodes.

Right, we have technical debt here, and lots of it. scnprintf() is
the right thing to use here.

So, after seeing the technical debt the kernel has accumulated, it's
been given a "somebody else's problem to solve" label, rather than
putting in the effort to fix it.

Basically you are saying "we know our software sucks and we don't
care enough to fix it", yes?

That's a truly awful way of handling out of bounds accesses: not
only are we saying we know our software sucks, we're telling the
user and making it their problem. It's a cop-out.

Obviously, but slapping band-aids around like this not a fix for
all the other existing (and future) buggy snprintf code.

I'm annoyed that every time a fundamental failing or technical debt
is uncovered in the kernel, nobody takes responsibility to fix the
problem completely, for everyone, for ever.

As Thomas said recently: correctness first.

https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/87v9nc63io.fsf@nanos.tec.linutronix.de/

This is not "good enough" - get rid of snprintf() altogether.
