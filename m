Sorry for bothering... After reading the previous discussion for a while,
I'm fine with the trivial cleanups. Yet, it seems that there are mainly 2
remaining open discussions unsolved yet...

1 is magic number 1000,
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20201029172045.GP1061252@magnolia

while I also don't have better ideas of this (and have no idea why queue
depth 1000 is optimal compared with other configurations), so it'd be better
to get your thoughts about this in advance (e.g. just leave it as-is, or...
plus, I don't have such test setting with such many cpus)

2 is the hash size modificiation,
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20201029162922.GM1061252@magnolia/

it seems previously hash entires are limited to 64k, and this patch relaxes
such limitation, but for huge directories I'm not sure the hash table
utilization but from the previous commit message it seems the extra memory
usage can be ignored.

Anyway, I'm fine with just leave them as-is if agreed on these.

Thanks,
Gao Xiang
