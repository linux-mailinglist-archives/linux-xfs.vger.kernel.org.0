Confused about the naming here -- we're assigning from a variable named
"async" to a variable named "sync"?

Oh, I see.  This is the mechanism by which the CIL figures out that the
AIL asked us to perform an async push of the current iclog to unpin some
items, so we want to move on to the next iclog so that we can flush
commit_iclog to disk, which will (eventually) help out the AIL?

This underscores the need for a quick comment explaining all this
cleverness, I think...
