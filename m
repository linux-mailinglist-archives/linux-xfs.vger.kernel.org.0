No, please don't layer additional meanings onto daxinherit=1.

I actually /do/ want to have a -d dax=1 option for "set up this
filesystem for DAX" that will configure the geometry for that device to
play nicely with the things that (some) DAX users want.

IOWs, you say "-d dax=1" and that means that mkfs sniffs out the
DAXiness of the underlying device and the PMD size.  Then it turns off
reflink by default, sets the daxinherit=1 hint, and configures the
extent size and su/sw hints to match the PMD size.

Or, you say "-r dax=1" for the realtime device, and now it sets the
allocation unit to the PMD size for people running huge databases and
want only huge pages to back their table data<cough>.

Zooming out a bit, maybe we should instead introduce a new "tuning"
parameter for -d and -r so that administrators could tune the filesystem
for specific purposes:

	-d tune=dax: Reject if device not dax, set daxinherit=1, set
	extsize/su/sw to match PMD

	-d tune=ssd: Set agcount to match the number of CPUs if
	possible, make the log larger to support a large number of
	threads and iops.

	-d tune=rotational: Probably does nothing. ;)

	-d tune=auto: Query blkid to guess which of the above three
	profiles we should use.

	-d tune=none: No tuning.

And then you'd do the same for the realtime device.

This would help us get rid of the seeeekret mkfs wrapper that we use to
make it easier for our internal customers to use DAX since mkfs.xfs
doesn't support config files.
