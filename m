Overall a good cleanup, comments inline.

FWIW, what does ic_sema protect?  It looks to me like it just
replaces the xfs_buf_lock(), and the only reason we were using that
is to allow unmount to wait for iclogbuf IO completion. Can we just
use a completion for this now?

Do we need to invalidate here for write only operation?  It's only
when we are bringing new data into memory we have to invalidate the
range, right?  e.g. xfs_buf_bio_end_io() only does invalidation on
read IO.

Fix the whitespace while you are touching this code?

That's a bit of a mess - hard to read. It's times like this that I
think generic helpers make the code worse rather than bettter.
Perhaps some slightly different indenting to indicate that the
howmany() function is actually a parameter of the struct_size()
macro?

		*iclogp = kmem_zalloc(struct_size(*iclogp, ic_bvec,
					howmany(log->l_iclog_size, PAGE_SIZE)),
				      KM_MAYFAIL);

Can we just put a pointer to the wq in the iclog? It only needs to
be set up at init time, then this only needs to be

	queue_work(iclog->ic_wq, &iclog->ic_end_io_work);

Aren't we're always going to be mapping the same pages to the same
bio at the same offsets. The only thing that changes is the length
of the bio and the sector it is addressed to. It seems kind of odd
to have an inline data buffer, bio and biovec all pre-allocated, but
then have to map them into exactly the same state for every IO we do
with them...

Hmmm - this open codes the end io error completion. Might be wroth a
comment indicating that this needs to be kept in sync with the io
completion processing?

Can we get a couple of comments here describing the difference
between ic_size, ic_io_size and log->l_iclog_size so I don't have to
go read all the code to find out what they are again in 6 months
time?

Cheers,

Dave.
