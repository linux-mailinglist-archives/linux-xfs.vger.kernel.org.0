Hi Pavel,

I don't know what this patch does from reading the subject line,
and the commit message doesn't tell me, either. :)

IOWs, please don't use abbreviations in the subject line because not
everyone understands what the abbreviation you used means. This
makes it hard to read the git history once the patch is committed.
Similarly, subjects that say "Fix the frobnozzle" can be better
written as something like:

xfs: clean up whitespace in xfs_isilocked() calls

So that the output of 'git log --oneline fs/xfs' it's totally
obvious what the commit is doing from the summary.  "Fix the
frobnozzle" is ambiguous because "fix" can mean many things, hence
to find out you need to look at the specific commit in more detail
and that slows down code and history searches....

Cheers,

Dave.
