That's because we are!

So .... I would like to do that refactoring.  I'd also like to fix this
with some expediency, TBH...

Refactoring is going to be a little more complicated, I fear, because sanity
on "what came straight from blkid" is a little different from "what came from
cmdline" and has slightly different checks than "how does it fit into the
superblock we just read?"

This (swidth-vs-sunit-is-borken) is common enough that I wanted to just kill
it with fire, and um ... make it all better/cohesive at some later date.

I don't like arguing for expediency over beauty but well... here I am.
