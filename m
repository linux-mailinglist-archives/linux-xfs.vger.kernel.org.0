FWIW, overlayfs also uses s_uuid in a similar manner to nfsd
as a persistent reference to the origin lower file after copy up.

Like nfsd, the overlayfs persistent origin handle (fsuuid+filehandle) will =
break
when changing lower fs uuid offline, but I don't see much difference from
changing s_uuid online - worse case that I can think of is that an overlayf=
s
inode will change its st_ino after evict/lookup on a mounted overlayfs.

Thanks,
Amir.
