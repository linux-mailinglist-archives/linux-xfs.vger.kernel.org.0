I thought about that a bit, but if we decided synchronous polled I/O
is not in major user anymore (which I think) and we think it is enough
of a burden to support (which I'm not sure of, but this patch points to)
then it might be time to remove it.

I think the point is that we need to offer sensible APIs for I/O
methods we want to support.

The loop driver still calls through the read/write iter method, and
the swap code ->direct_IO path is not used for block devices (and
completley broken right now, see the patch series from Neil).

But the loop driver is a good point, even for the iomap case as the
blk_finish_plug would only flush the plug that is on-stack in
__iomap_dio_rw, it would not help you with any plug holder by caller
higher in the stack.
