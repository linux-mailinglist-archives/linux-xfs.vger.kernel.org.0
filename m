Yes, that's my recollection too -- performing a logwrite replay of an
old mark means that you can end up with blocks with the correct fs uuid
but an LSN that's higher than anything in the log.  Recovery will then
skip the block replay, which is not correct.

I suppose we could fix log recovery to treat incoming block LSNs that
are higher than the log head as if there were no block contents at all.
OTOH going backwards in time isn't usually a concern...right?

Yep.  The test needs to reset the block device to a zeroed state.
Discards get us there quickly, but only if discard_zeroes_data==1.
Hence bolting dm-thinp (where this is guaranteed) onto the logwrites
tests.

Not sure -- I think BLKZEROOUT will cause allocations and real disk
writes if we're not careful.
