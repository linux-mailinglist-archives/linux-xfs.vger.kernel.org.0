From the filesystem side, that should not be an issue at all.

From the storage side, you really want to expand the storage with
chunks that have the same geometry (stripe unit and stripe width)
so that it doesn't screw up the alignment of the filesystem to the
new storage.

And that's where the difficultly may lie. If the existing storage
volume the filesystem sits on doesn't end exactly on a stripe width
boundary, you're going to have to offset the start of the new
storage volumes part way into the first stripe width in the volumes
to ensure that when the filesystem expands, then end of the first
stripe width in the new volume is exactly where the filesystem
expects it to be.

Other than that, there shouldn't be any filesystem level concerns
about doubling the size of the filesystem capacity via growfs.

Cheers,

Dave.
