Initially I did just store the inode numbers, but that made the code
more clunky due to needing more _iget and _irele calls, and a bunch of
error handling for that.  Dave suggested on irc that I should retain the
reference to the incore inode to simplify the initial patch, and if we
run into ENOMEM then we can fix it later.

I wasn't 100% convinced of that, but Dave or Brian or someone (memory
foggy, don't remember who) countered that the system recovering the fs
is usually the system that crashed in the first place, and it certainly
had enough RAM to hold the inodes.

I think the link you're looking for is[1].
