To be able to always guarantee the removal of an existing directory entry, we
reserve inode fork extent count required for removing a directory entry in
addition to that required for the directory entry add operation.

A bug was discovered when executing the following sequence of
operations,
1. Keep inserting directory entries until the pseudo max extent count limit is
   reached.
2. At this stage, a directory entry remove operation will fail because it
   tries to reserve XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT(mp) worth of extent count. This
   reservation fails since the extent count would go over the pseudo max
   extent count limit as it did in step 1.

We would end up with a directory which can never be deleted.

Hence V11 doubles the extent count reservation for "directory entry insert"
operations. The first XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT(mp) instance is for "insert"
operation while the second XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT(mp) instance is for
guaranteeing a possible future "remove" operation to succeed.

Creating a new hard link involves adding a new directory entry. Hence apart
from reserving extent count for directory entry addition we will have to
reserve extent count for a future directory entry removal as well.

Extent count is doubled since this is essentially a directory insert operation
w.r.t target_dp directory. One instance of XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT(mp) is for
the directory entry being added to target_dp directory and another instance of
XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT(mp) is for guaranteeing a future directory entry
removal from target_dp directory to succeed.

Extent count check is doubled since this is a directory insert operation w.r.t
target_dp directory ... One instance of XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT(mp) is for the
directory entry being added to target_dp directory and another instance of
XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT(mp) is for guaranteeing a future directory entry
removal from target_dp directory to succeed.

Since a directory entry is being removed from src_dp, reserving only a single
instance of XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT(mp) would suffice.

Here again we have to reserve two instances of XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT(mp) for
target_name insertion and one instance of XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT(mp) for
src_name removal. This is because insertion and removal of src_name may each
end up consuming XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT(mp) extent counts in the worst case. A
future directory entry remove operation will require
XFS_IEXT_DIR_MANIP_CNT(mp) extent counts to be reserved.

Also, You are right about "target name does not exist" being synonymous with
target_ip == NULL.

Yes, you are right.

You are right. Sorry, I missed this. I will move the extent count reservation
logic to come after the invocation of xfs_cross_rename().

I will also add appropriate comments into xfs_rename() describing the
scenarios that have been discussed above.

PS: I have swapped the order of two comments from your original reply since I
think it is easier to explain the scenarios with the order of
comments/questions swapped.

This is again similar to adding a new directory entry. Hence, apart from
reserving extent count for directory entry addition we will have to reserve
extent count for a future directory entry removal as well.
