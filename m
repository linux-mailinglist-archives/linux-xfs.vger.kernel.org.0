Yup, ISTR in the past it didn't even take inode references, but I
may be misremembering...

I'm pretty sure that we only need to avoid INEW and IRECLAIM.
Anything else that has dquots attached needs to be locked and have
them removed. Those that are marked INEW will not have dquots
attached, and those marked IRECLAIM are in the process of being torn
down so their dquots will be released in short order.

Cheers,

Dave.
