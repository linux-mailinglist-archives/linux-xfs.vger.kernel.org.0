Which applications?  Name them.

We *really* don't want to encourage applications to make decisions
only based on the mount options.  For example, it could be that the
application's files will have the S_DAX flag set.

It would be a real shame if we are actively encourage applications to
use a broken configuration mechanism which was only used as a hack
while DAX was in experimental status.
