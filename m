The biggest issue was how it was presented.

Normally I see reports from the kernel robot for specific
uncommitted patches like this as a threaded reply to the specific
patch that was identified as having a problem.  And normally this
sort of standalone test failure report comes from a failure bisected
to a commit already in an upstream tree. 

So my confusion here is largely because a bug in an uncommitted
patch was reported in the same manner as an upstream regression
would be reported - as a standalone bug report...

Yes, commit ID by itself is not sufficient to identify the issue,
nor is a pointer to the CI tree the robot built. For a patch pulled
from a list, it should not be reported as a "commit that failed".
It should be reported as "uncommitted patch that failed", with:

- a lore link to the patch that was identified as having an issue;
- a pointer to the base tree the patch(es) were applied to (e.g.
  linus-v5.19-rc7, linux-next-2022-25-09, etc)
- a pointer to the CI integration tree (that doesn't) the patch was
  applied to and tested.

For an upstream commit that failed, reporting "<commit id> failed"
is a good start, but it really needs to include the tree as the
robot might be testing dev trees or linux-next rather than Linus's
tree. i.e. report as "<tree, commit id> failed <test>".

> 2) do not send such report, if the patch has already been NACKed

That's not so much a problem. The real problem that needs solving is
ensuring that the recipients of the bug report are able to quickly
and obviously identify what was being tested when the issue was hit.

Cheers,

Dave.
