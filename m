Fair enough.  I'm not a paragon of correctness wrt. boolean logic either.
I'm ok if you leave it as is.

OTOH it's an opportunity to make the asserts more useful, because right
now they just say:

XFS (sda): Assertion failed: counter >= 0, file: xfs_trans.c, line XXX

*Which* counter just tripped the assert?  At least it could say:

XFS (sda): Assertion failed: mp->m_sb.sb_dblocks >= 0, file: xfs_trans.c, line XXX

<nod> I have, but only after seriously fubaring some code. :)
