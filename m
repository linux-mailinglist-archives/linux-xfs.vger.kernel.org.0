Where "regular transactions" means data I/O, yes.  All normal metadata
I/O eventually ends up on a delwri list.  And we want it on that delwri
list after actually updating the contents.

I think it is misnamed and not clearly defined, and we should probably
fix that.  Note that least the current list_empty() usage isn't quite
correct either without a lock held by the delwri list owner.  We at
least need a list_empty_careful for a racey but still save check.

Thinking out loud I wonder if we can just kill XBF_DELWRI_Q entirely.
Except for various asserts we mostly use it in reverse polarity, that is
to cancel delwri writeout for stale buffers.  How about just skipping
XBF_STALE buffers on the delwri list directly and not bother with
DELWRI_Q?  With that we can then support multiple delwri lists that
don't get into each others way using say an allocating xarray instead
of the invase list and avoid this whole mess.

Let me try to prototype this..

Right now yes.  But I think the delwri behavior is a land mine, and
this just happens to be the first user to trigger it.  Edit: while
looking through the DELWRI_Q usage I noticed xfs_qm_flush_one, which
seems to deal with what is at least a somewhat related issue based
on the comments there.

Yes, that makes sense.  Would be great to document such details in the
commit message..
