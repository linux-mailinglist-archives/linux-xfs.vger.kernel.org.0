Yes, I agree all of this, this field can be handled by the inode
verifier. The only concern I can think out might be fs freeze
with a directory inode that is empty and unlinked but held open,
and then recovery on a unpatched old kernels, not sure if such
case can be handled properly by old kernel verifier.

Otherwise, it's also ok I think.

Thanks,
