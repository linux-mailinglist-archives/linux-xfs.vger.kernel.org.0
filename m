How complicated would it be to keep supporting using the page bit when
merkle_tree_block_size == page_size and the filesystem supports it?  It's an
efficient solution, so it would be a shame to lose it.  Also it doesn't have the
max file size limit that the bitmap has.

The spinlock is needed when there are multiple Merkle tree blocks per page and
the filesystem is using the page-based caching.  So I don't think you can remove
it.  Can you elaborate on why you feel it can be removed?

Note that the above comment explains why the spinlock is needed.

It's not clear what block_cached is supposed to mean here.
