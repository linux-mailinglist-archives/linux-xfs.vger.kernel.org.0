I really didn't want to remove the code that used the "head_agino"
for verification until I had moved all the list traversal
functionality to use the in memory unlinked list and had verified
that was correct....

I think merging them it could be done, but it will most likely
result in having to rebase and retest every subsequent patch...

Cheers,

Dave.
