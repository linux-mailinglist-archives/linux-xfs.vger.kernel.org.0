First off, I was not aware of these two proposed solutions so apologies for submitting a third (are there more) one.

The common problem I see with both proposed patches is that they specifically tackle io/mmap.c when really any inclusion order of linux.h and sys/mman.h could and would lead to the the same problem to re-surface somewhere else in a different file. So sure enough there is only mmap.c now, but it has been identified that this specific include order is problematic so we ought to address it in a general way.

Fabrice's patch is only a few months old, and but "info@mobile-stream.com"'s is nearly 4 years old...

Sure that would work too, but we will still end up with some MAP_SYNC conditional code, so the original intent of always defining it seemed laudable.
