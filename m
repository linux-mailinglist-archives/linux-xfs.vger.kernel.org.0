I was going from the comment:

        /* Unserialized, strictly 'current' */
(which you can't see from the context of the diff, but is above the block)

The situation with ->flags is a little more ambiguous:

/*
 * Only the _current_ task can read/write to tsk->flags, but other
 * tasks can access tsk->flags in readonly mode for example
 * with tsk_used_math (like during threaded core dumping).
 * There is however an exception to this rule during ptrace
 * or during fork: the ptracer task is allowed to write to the
 * child->flags of its traced child (same goes for fork, the parent
 * can write to the child->flags), because we're guaranteed the
 * child is not running and in turn not changing child->flags
 * at the same time the parent does it.
 */

but it wasn't unsafe to use the PF_ flags in the way that you were.
It's just crowded.

If in_memstall is set on other tasks, then it should be moved to the
PFA flags, which there are plenty of.

But a quick grep shows it only being read on other tasks and always
set on current:

kernel/sched/psi.c:     *flags = current->in_memstall;
kernel/sched/psi.c:      * in_memstall setting & accounting needs to be atomic wrt
kernel/sched/psi.c:     current->in_memstall = 1;
kernel/sched/psi.c:      * in_memstall clearing & accounting needs to be atomic wrt
kernel/sched/psi.c:     current->in_memstall = 0;
kernel/sched/psi.c:     if (task->in_memstall)
kernel/sched/stats.h:           if (p->in_memstall)
kernel/sched/stats.h:           if (p->in_memstall)
kernel/sched/stats.h:   if (unlikely(p->in_iowait || p->in_memstall)) {
kernel/sched/stats.h:           if (p->in_memstall)
kernel/sched/stats.h:   if (unlikely(rq->curr->in_memstall))

so I think everything is fine.
