IIUC, what you are saying is that this debug code is simply not
exercised in normal testing and hasn't been for the past decade?
And it still won't be exercised on anything other than realtime
device testing?

I don't really consider !lazycount worth investing time and
effort into because deprecated and default for over a decade, so if
this is the case, then why not just remove it?

Cheers,

Dave.
