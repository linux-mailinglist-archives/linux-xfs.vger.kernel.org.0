I'd suggest that a comment be added here along the lines of:

This interface exposes an internal implementation detail of XFS, and
as such is explicitly not part of any userspace API/ABI guarantee
the kernel may give userspace. These are undocumented features of
the generic workqueue implementation XFS uses for concurrency, and
they are provided here purely for diagnostic and tuning purposes and
may change at any time in the future.

Otherwise looks ok.

Cheers,

Dave.
