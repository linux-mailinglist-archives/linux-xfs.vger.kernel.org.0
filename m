Yes!  Finally a better set of names!  I've been stuck on that for a

Ok, I'll move these two functions to xfs_defer.c.

Um, this function doesn't cancel the list at all.  Are you asking why it
is that "reattach captured dfops to transaction" and "free the capture
structure" are separate steps?

> dfc->dfc_dfops already be empty here? And if it isn't, shouldn't

Yes, dfc_dfops should be empty at this point.  In the BUI recovery UAF
patch, this xfs_defer_capture_free call is used to unlock and release
the captured inode(s) after the transaction commits.

An alternate way to design this would have been that xfs_defer_continue
totally consumes the *dfc (and frees it) as part of reattaching the
dfops list to the transaction; and in the later patch that adds inodes
to the capture structure, we'd pass out any inode pointers and
let xlog_finish_defer_ops unlock and release it directly.

Hmm, maybe that /would/ be more clear than this setup...

Overly compact code, I suppose.  If xlog_finish_defer_ops succeeds, the
call is a nop since the list is empty; but if there was an error, then
we still need to walk the list and free the remaining capture
structures.

This probably would have been clearer had I ended the function like
this:

	xfs_trans_ail_cursor_done(&cur);
	spin_unlock(&ailp->ail_lock);
	if (error)
		goto err;

	error = xlog_finish_defer_ops(log->l_mp, &capture_list);
	if (error)
		goto err;

	return 0;
err:
	xfs_defer_ops_release_all(log->l_mp, &capture_list);
	return error;
}
