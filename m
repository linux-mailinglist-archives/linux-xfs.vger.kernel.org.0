Same reason the returned buffer has always been 8 byte aligned -
because we cast ixit  to on-disk structures that assume 8 byte
memory alignment of the structure. e.g. when formatting inodes,
intents, etc.

We don't care about the ophdr itself, because it only contains
4 byte aligned variables (32 bit) and the log only requires them to
be 4 byte alignment of regions (asserts in xlog_write() that it
casts to ophdrs to update them...

Nothign wrong here with the old or the new code. The old code *adds*
the unaccounted ophdr space for each region here, but now everything
has an embedded opheader it's accounted directly to the region size.
Hence the size of the regions we summed in the above loop already
accounts for the ophdr space and we no longer need to account for
opheaders individually here.

Right. We don't know ahead of time when a region is going to be
split across two iclogs, so we still have to handle the case of
adding a ophdr for a split region. This gets much simpler later on
in the series as the xlog_write() code is factored.

This code is completely reworked later in the series and these
whacky corner cases largely go away. There's not much point in
making this "robust" because of this...

The ophdr doesn't need to be 64 bit aligned, just the
buffer that is returned from xlog_prepare_iovec(). That means we
still have to guarantee space in the buffer for that to be rounded
to 64 bits if it's not already aligned. All of the iovecs might
require padding to align them, so the presence of the ophdr doesn't
really change anything at all here...

Dave.
