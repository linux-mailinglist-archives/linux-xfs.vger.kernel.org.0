Yes, but the INCOMPLETE flag is not indicating a user specified
attribute namespace type like user.*, system.* or secure.*. We're just using
the flag to store that prefix in as little space as possible.

Indeed, we can have incomplete attributes in all the namespaces, so
what we are really using this field and it's flags for is search
filtering.

If it's filtering, then attr_filter might be appropriate. We only
return attributes that match the filter mask....

*nod*

I don't think we need all that jazz (waves jazz hands in the air) if
we look at it from the point of view of it being a filter mask
rather than a namespace specifier....

Cheers,
