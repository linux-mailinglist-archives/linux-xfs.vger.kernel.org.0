It can, but now it will fail to get the buffer lock because we
currently hold it and so can't do anything writeback related with
the inode item regardless of whether this bit is set or not.  i.e.
This patch actually fixes the race you are refering to....

I thought I killed that comment - you noted it was incorrect in
the previous iteration. I'll kill it properly when I update the
spulling misteaks above.
