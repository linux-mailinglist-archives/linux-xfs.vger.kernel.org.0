So you make other changes to mkfs that aren't yet upstream that
check whether the log causes the root inode to change position?
I mean, '-l size=8180b' results in a log that fits perfectly fine in
an empty AG, and so you must have added more checks to detect this
moves the root inode somehow?

> That said... -d agcount=3200,size=6366g -lagnum=0 -N seems to work?

On a new mkfs binary with those checks that you mention above?  If
so, it seems to me that those new checks trigger for this case, too,
before we write anything?

IOWs, this won't fail on older mkfs.xfs binaries that don't have
these new log size checks because we never get around to allocating
the root inode and checking it's location, right?  Yet what we
really want here is for it to fail on an old mkfs binary?

Cheers,

Dave.
