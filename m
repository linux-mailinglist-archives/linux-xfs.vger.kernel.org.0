I have no strong opinion either way, just trying to explore avenues we
may already have.

When I do mkfs.xfs -f /dev/vdb this is what I get from:

udevadm monitor --environment


monitor will print the received events for:
UDEV - the event which udev sends out after rule processing
KERNEL - the kernel uevent
