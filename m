(try to cc Dave...)

I'm not quite familiar with filestream as well. After several days random
glance about the constraint of shrink feature in XFS, I found such comment
and try to understand such constraint.

Finally, I think it was useful only when perag was once an array and need
to be reallocated (before 1c1c6ebcf52). So need to close the race by the
m_peraglock (which is now deleted) and drain out in-flight AG filestream
by xfs_filestream_flush() in growfs code (I think due to pag array
reallocation). 

For now, m_peraglock and xfs_filestream_flush() in xfs_growfs_data_private()
no longer exist... and we don't need to reallocate perag array but rather
to use radix tree instead.

but IMO, shrink an AG might need to restore to drain in-flight filestream,
I couldn't tell much more of it... Overall, the current comment is quite
confusing. I'd suggest it'd be better with some more reasonable comment
about this at least...

Thanks,
Gao Xiang
