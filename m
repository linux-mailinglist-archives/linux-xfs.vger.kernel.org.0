Have you still been unable to reproduce (assuming you've been attempting
to)? How many iterations were required before you reproduced the first
time?

I'm wondering if the XLOG_STATE_IOERROR check in xfs_log_release_iclog()
is racy with respect to filesystem shutdown. There's an ASSERT_ALWAYS()
earlier in this (xlog_cil_push()) codepath that checks for ACTIVE ||
WANT_SYNC and it doesn't appear that has failed from your output
snippet. The aforementioned IOERROR check occurs before we acquire
->l_icloglock, however, which I think means xfs_log_force_umount() could
jump in if called from another task and reset all of the iclogs while
the release path waits on the lock.
