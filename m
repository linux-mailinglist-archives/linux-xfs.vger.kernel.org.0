I'm not sure if there's a good way to automate this.  But let's go
through the grep output?

009F;<control>;Cc;0;BN;;;;;N;APPLICATION PROGRAM COMMAND;;;;

This one seems to render as Ÿ (Y with two dots above it) so I didn't put
this in the case statement.

034F;COMBINING GRAPHEME JOINER;Mn;0;NSM;;;;;N;;;;;

Doesn't seem to have any sort of rendering (i.e. if I type them into a
web browser, it doesn't render any glyph at all), so I put it in the
case statement.

200B;ZERO WIDTH SPACE;Cf;0;BN;;;;;N;;;;;
200C;ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER;Cf;0;BN;;;;;N;;;;;
200D;ZERO WIDTH JOINER;Cf;0;BN;;;;;N;;;;;

These ones have 'zero-width' in the name, so I put these in the
denylist.

2060;WORD JOINER;Cf;0;BN;;;;;N;;;;;

https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/ says that this doesn't have
any rendering, nor does my web browser try one.

Come to think of it, I should probably add these two:

2028;LINE SEPARATOR;Zl;0;WS;;;;;N;;;;;
2029;PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR;Zp;0;B;;;;;N;;;;;

because it doesn't render either.

2061;FUNCTION APPLICATION;Cf;0;BN;;;;;N;;;;;

https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr25/tr25-6.html says this is a
metacharacter and doesn't have its own rendering.  It seems to be there
to indicate that this:

f(x + y)

is a function taking "x + y" as a parameter, and not shorthand for:

f*x + f+y

2062;INVISIBLE TIMES;Cf;0;BN;;;;;N;;;;;
2063;INVISIBLE SEPARATOR;Cf;0;BN;;;;;N;;;;;
2064;INVISIBLE PLUS;Cf;0;BN;;;;;N;;;;;

These have 'invisible' in the name, that seems pretty obvious to me.

2D7F;TIFINAGH CONSONANT JOINER;Mn;9;NSM;;;;;N;;;;;

This one doesn't seem to render either.  Unicode 15.1 says it isn't
visible rendered.

FEFF;ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE;Cf;0;BN;;;;;N;BYTE ORDER MARK;;;;

Another 'zero-width' one, same as the others.

1107F;BRAHMI NUMBER JOINER;Mn;9;NSM;;;;;N;;;;;
11A47;ZANABAZAR SQUARE SUBJOINER;Mn;9;NSM;;;;;N;;;;;
11A99;SOYOMBO SUBJOINER;Mn;9;NSM;;;;;N;;;;;
13430;EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPH VERTICAL JOINER;Cf;0;L;;;;;N;;;;;
13431;EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPH HORIZONTAL JOINER;Cf;0;L;;;;;N;;;;;

When I typed these into a browser, I got *some* kind of rendering.  I
doubt I'm using them correctly, since they're likely supposed to be
surrounded by other codepoints from the same chart.

11F42;KAWI CONJOINER;Mn;9;NSM;;;;;N;;;;;

I don't even know about this one; it generated "tofu" (aka those horrid
rectangular boxes with the byte representation in them).  On the other
hand, https://www.unicode.org/notes/tn48/UTN48-Implementing-Kawi-1.pdf
says it's not visible by itself.  But paired with Kawi script, it's
supposed to affect the formatting.

I'm not sure how exactly to write a classifier here -- the 'invisible'
and 'zero width' ones are obvious, but the 'joiner' code points don't
seem to have any obvious trend to them.

For now I think I'll take the "conservative" approach and only flag
things that sound like they're supposed to be general metacharacters,
and leave out the modifier codepoints that are ok if they're surrounded
by certain codepoints.  But this is a rather manual process.
