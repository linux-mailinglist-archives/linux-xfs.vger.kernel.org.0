Ok.

That sounds like a reasonable description of behavior to me. Personally,
I also think the commit log description is fine because I read it
generically as just pointing out the logic is backwards. Your
description above is more detailed and probably more technically
accurate, but I'm not sure if/why it matters at this point for anything
beyond just attempting to understand a historical bug (for stable
backport purposes?).
