No reason in particular that I'm aware of...

Hmmm I think it might, but I'm not totally sure. What is slightly
interesting is that xfs_attr_shortform_to_leaf() makes an attempt to put
the shortform format back into place on error. I briefly thought about
doing this for the dir code but figured it wasn't worth it given the
other dir conversions and operations are likely to have dirtied the tx
by that point. That said, the attr variant skips the recovery attempt in
the event of -EIO for some reason, which happens to be the error here.

So I suppose we could either stuff it in
xfs_bmap_local_to_extents_empty() since it's only called in these two
places, or we could do something similar in xfs_attr_shortform_to_leaf()
and perhaps remove the "recovery" attempt since we'll definitely abort
there as well. Hm?
