I am fine with your changes. Few notes below.

I believe this is an important part because it shows that new people
coming to the existing code shouldn't take it as correct and rather
question it. Also having a clear indication that overuse is causing real
problems that might be not immediately visible to subsystems outside of
MM.

The above text has mentioned the transaction context nesting as well and
that was a hint by Dave IIRC. It is imho good to have an example of
other reentrant points than just locks. I believe another useful example
would be something like loop device which is mixing IO and FS layers but
I am not familiar with all the details to give you an useful text.

I would reiterate "Do not just wrap vmalloc by the scope api but rather
rely on the real scope for the NOFS/NOIO context". Maybe we want to
stress out that once a scope is defined it is sticky to _all_
allocations and all allocators within that scope. The text is already
saying that but maybe we want to make it explicit and make it stand out.

I dunno. I wouldn't make nowait implicitly NOWARN as well. At least not
with the initial implementation. Maybe we will learn later that there is
just too much unhelpful noise in the kernel log and will reconsider but
I wouldn't just start with that. Also we might learn that there will be
other modifiers for atomic (or should I say non-sleeping) scopes to be
defined. E.g. access to memory reserves but let's just wait for real
usecases.


Thanks a lot Matthew!
