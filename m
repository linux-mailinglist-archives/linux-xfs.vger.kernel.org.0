Maybe, but we do already have the versionnum command that dumps the
feature bits in text/human readable format....

Yeah, you've probably never cleared just the dirv2 bit. That one has
an assert on it these days because the kernel only supports v2-based

probably don't do the right thing for v5 formats :)
