Ok, but the things I suggested below don't require deep knowledge
of xfs - just looking at the POC and understanding/describing what
it is doing, simplifying it to the fewest syscalls to provoke the
problem, what privileges are required to form a general assessment
of a possible threat, etc.

I did not construct a new reproducer, I ran your exact set of steps
using your kernel version, your config, and your repro.c, and while
it triggered a bug in XFS, it did not trigger any KASAN errors.

As I originally asked - does it do so for you? Looking at the logs,
it seems very possible that tests that ran prior to the xfs test
may have corrupted memory, which the xfs repro.c stumbled into during
your run, and won't be reproduced on a fresh run of that reproducer.

Thanks,
-Eric
