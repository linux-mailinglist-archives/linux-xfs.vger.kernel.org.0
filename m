Good day,

  I have a mutual business proposal, which refers to the transfer of a large amount of money to an account abroad, with your help as a foreign partner as a beneficiary of the funds. Everything about this transaction will be legal without any bridge of financial authority both in my country and yours. If you are interested and I will give you more information about the project as soon as I receive your positive response.

Best regards,

Executive Director.
 
ICBC. China
