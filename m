No worries :)

OH, yikes, this is what goes into include/linux.h (which is also
exported as /usr/include/xfs/linux.h):

#ifndef HAVE_MAP_SYNC
#define MAP_SYNC 0
#define MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE 0
#else
#include <asm-generic/mman.h>
#include <asm-generic/mman-common.h>
#endif /* HAVE_MAP_SYNC */

xfsprogs has no business exporting redefinitions of kernel symbols to
userspace.  This innocent looking program on an x64 system:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <xfs/xfs.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	printf("MAP_SYNC 0x%x\n", MAP_SYNC);
}

prints "MAP_SYNC 0x0", not the "MAP_SYNC 0x80000" that you'd expect.

Ok, all this override stuff needs to die.

Exactly.

Yep.

Oh no, if I cleaned up xfs_io mmap command, I'd also get rid of the
override stuff too.  Working on it...
