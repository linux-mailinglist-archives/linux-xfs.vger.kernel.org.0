Hi Chandan,

It would have been useful to get this sort of overview in a cover
letter instead of
having to find it in the last patch.

I suppose it is a coincident that this work ended up in our mailboxes together
with Allison's delayed attr work, but it is interesting to know if the two works
affect each other in any way.

Thanks,
Amir.
