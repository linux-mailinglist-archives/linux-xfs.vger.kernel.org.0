Yes, this came up in one of the other reviews.  I thought about it, but 
then decided against it.  xfs_attr_rmtval_remove disappears across 
patches 13 and 14.  The use of xfs_attr_rmtval_remove is replaced with 
xfs_attr_rmtval_unmap when we finally yank out all the transaction code. 
  The reason I dont want to do it all at once is because that would mean 
patches 12, 13, 14 and 19 would lump together to make the swap 
instantaneous in once patch.

I've been getting feedback that the set is really complicated, so I've 
been trying to find a way to organize it to help make it easier to 
review.  So I thought isolating 13 and 14 to just the state machine 
would help.  Thus I decided to keep patch 12 separate to take as much 
craziness out of 13 and 14 as possible.  Patches 12 and 19 seem like 
otherwise easy things for people to look at.  Let me know your thoughts 
on this. :-)

You are right about the stale comment though, I missed it while going 
back over the commentary at the top.  Will fix.

Allison
