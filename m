Me neither.

Agree, we'd better to give io_uring a test by default. I've found
several regression issues on io_uring by fsstress. If someone feels
io_uring breaks his testing, remove the liburing and liburing-devel
package, then fsstress won't build io_uring things. Or export
FSSTRESS_AVOID="-f uring_read=0 -f uring_write=0". Sometimes, I even
removed the IO_URING kernel config then rebuild kernel, to avoid
the effection of io_uring code totally.

Thanks,
Zorro
