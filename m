Using a virtual machine under the hood to get around these limitations
isn't really an option either. Like I said, this works perfectly fine
if the filesystem's mkfs tool supports populating the filesystem from
a given directory (and btrfs, ext4 already support this with xattrs
and everything). It even works fine with XFS's -p option already,
except when you try to build an image with SELinux enabled as all the
SELinux xattrs are stripped. I would just like to not have to tell my
users to use another filesystem than XFS when they would like to build
images with SELinux enabled unprivileged.

Cheers,

Daan
