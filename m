<repeated many times>

It seems that the only problem w/ the filesystem detected by repair is a 
ridiculously large stripe width, and that's found on every superblock.

dmesg (expectedly) finds the same error when mounting.

Pretty weird, I've never seen this before. And, xfs_repair seems unable 
to fix this type of corruption.

can you do:

dd if=<filesystem device or image> bs=512 count=1 | hexdump -C

and paste that here?

I'd also like to see what xfs_ifo says about other filesystems on the md 
raid.
