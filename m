Yes, it means block available without doing further work.
I can't say _RTNOGC is very descriptive either, but I would not mind
a better name if someone came up with a good one :)

At least if there are no waiters yet, yes.

Yes (In a way modelled after the log grant waits).

Yes.

No other zone to move to.

Posix/Linux semantics for buffered writes require us to implement
short writes.  That is if a single (p)write(v) syscall for say 10MB
only find 512k of space it should write those instead of failing
with ENOSPC.  The XFS_ZR_GREEDY implements that by backing down to
what we can allocate (and the current implementation for that is
a little ugly, I plan to find some time for changes to the core
percpu_counters to improve this after the code is merged).
