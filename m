Well, it /does/ seem to work as intended -- you can create a filesystem
with a 100G agsize even on a 8G filesystem.  We've been over the
drawbacks of this approach vs. Dave's (i.e. explodefs is really only a
one-time event) so I won't rehash that here.

But it does solve the much more constrained problem of disk images
deployed from a gold master image undergoing a massive onetime expansion
during firstboot.  The lack of secondary superblocks and xfs_repair
warnings are concerning, but to that, I have these things to say:

a. If it's a gold master image from a trusted distributor, they should
be installing verity information on all the read-mostly files so that
one can validate the vendor's signatures.  The fs metadata being corrupt
is moot if fsverity fails.

b. We can turn off the xfs_repair hostility to single-AG filesystems
so that people who /do/ want to fsck their goldmaster images don't get
annoying warnings.  We /could/ add a new compat flag to say it's ok to
single-AG, or we could hang that on the fsverity sb flag.

c. Over on our end, we know the minimum cloud boot volume size -- it's
47GB.  My canned OL9 image seems to come with a 36GB root filesystem.
My guess is that most of our users will say yes to the instance creator
asking them if they want more space (a princely 67GB minimum if you're
stingy like I am!) so I think one could tweak the image creator to spit
out a 36GB AG XFS, knowing that only the Ferengi users *won't* end up
with a double-AG rootfs.

IOWs, this more or less works for the usecase that generates the most
internal complaints about xfs sucking.  As I said earlier, I've not
heard about people wanting to 10000x growfs after firstboot; usually
they only grow incrementally as they decide that extra $$$$$ is worth
another 10GB.

I think this is worth prototyping a bit more.  Do you?
