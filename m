Oh, I wouldn't even bother with a Reported-by tag then. It's just
like a reviewer pointing out that there was an issue with the patch
- you don't add "reported-by" for every little thing that someone
points out that you fix, right? You might mention who noticed it
in the changelog for the patch, but this sort of information does
not belong in the commit message for a new feature.

IOWs, reported-by is really only useful for referencing the bug
report for a regression or bug that was found in a released kernel
- it's not useful or meaningful for patches that are being developed
and have not yet been merged...

Cheers,

Dave.
