Since 6.1 isn't out yet, I did a `libxfs-apply <last libxfscommit>..`, my fault
for not spotting you've patches already queued for 6.2. I'm planning to release
xfsprogs-6.1 some time later after linux 6.1 is out, so this patch will already
be in Linus's tree by the time. I can also get this patch out of the tree when I
push the other patches I have queued up, although I'm trying to avoid doing
forced updates to the tree. Is it ok for you to leave it in the tree, or better
remove it by now?
Cheers
