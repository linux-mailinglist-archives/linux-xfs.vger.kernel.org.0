And that could be done oneline...

Other drawbacks are that you've fixed the AG size, so if you don't grow
past the AG size you picked at mkfs time, you've still got only one
superblock in the deployed image.

i.e. if you set it to 100G, you're OK if you're growing to 300-400G.
If you are only growing to 50G, not so much.

(and vice versa - if you optimize for gaining superblocks, you have to
pick a fairly small AG size, then run the risk of growing thousands of them)

In other words, it requires choices at mkfs time, whereas Dave's proposal
lets those choices be made per system, at "expand" time, when the desired
final size is known.

(And, you start right out of the gate with poorly distributed data and inodes,
though I'm not sure how much that'd matter in practice.)

(I'm not sure the ideas are even mutually exclusive; I think you could have
a single AG image with dblocks << agblocks << 2^agblocklog, and a simple
growfs adds agblocks-sized AGs, whereas an "expand" could adjust agblocks,
then growfs to add more?)

And host it on ext4, LOL.
