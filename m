Ok, there's a fundamental flaw in this patch: the AIL doesn't track
the commit record LSN of log items, it tracks the *start record LSN* of the
checkpoint.

l_last_sync_lsn is the highest commit record lsn seen by the log,
whilst ailp->ail_max_seen_lsn tracks the highest start record lsn.
The difference between the two is the size of the checkpoint, and
this means by the end of the patch the grant head space that is
tracked does not have the space used by the last checkpoint
committed removed from it.

i.e. grant head space won't go to zero even when the CIL is
empty and there are no transactions in flight - the log needs to be
covered for it to drop to the size of the last iclog written to the
log during covering operations.

This causes problems with small logs - there may be space in the log
for new reservations, but because the grant space doesn't get
decremented by a log force flushing the CIL correctly,
xlog_space_left() doesn't actually report them as free and so
reservations stall until the log is covered some 30s later. Then the
same thing happens again short while later...

Essentially, this patch needs to be reworked - l_last_sync_lsn needs
to stay, but the location that is updated at needs to change to the
CIL commit callbacks so we can update it while holding the AIL lock
and then it doesn't needs to be an atomic variable....

Cheers,

Dave.
