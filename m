What's the motivation for checking this in userspace?  Programs are
allowed to set up this (admittedly minimally functional) configuration,
or even set it up after the mmap by truncating the file.

OTOH if your goal is to write a test to check the SIGBUS functionality,
you could install a sigbus handler to report the signal to stderr, which
would avoid bash writing junk about the sigbus to the terminal.
