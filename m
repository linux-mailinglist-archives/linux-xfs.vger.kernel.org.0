Looking at this some more, I think it was never clear when the warnings
should get incremented. An old IRIX document[1] says:

"With soft limits, whenever a user logs in with a usage greater than his
soft limit, he or she will be warned (via/bin/login(1))."

Which seems to indicate that perhaps the warning was intended to be
once per login, not once per allocation attempt. Also ...

Ancient XFS code had a "xfs_qm_dqwarn()" function which incremented the
warning count, but it never had any callers until the day it was removed
in 2005, so it's not at all clear what the warning frequency was supposed
to be or what should trigger it, from the code archives.

Hence, my modest proposal would be to just remove the warning limits
infrastructure altogether. It's never worked, nobody has ever asked for it
(?), and its intent is not clear. My only hesitation is that Darrick added
the warning increment, so perhaps he knows of a current use case that
matters?

thanks,
-Eric
