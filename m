Nope, both x517 and g390 still fire this assert, so there's
something else we're missing here.

I keep wondering if we should be wrapping the entire flush mechanism
in a rwsem - read for flush, write for start/stop - so that we
aren't ever still processing a stop while a concurrent start runs or
vice versa...

Cheers,
