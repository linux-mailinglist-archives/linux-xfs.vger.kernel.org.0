Effectively, yes.

Pretty much. I had some difficulty in working out how to break this
large function up sanely because of the 3-4 conditional functions
it performed for error handling, I named the function originally for
handling sync IO errors vs async IO errors which (may) require
retries.

So, yeah, "fail_immediately" is probably a better description, or
"fail_no_retry" sounds like a better name.

I thought I preserved it somewhere... yeah, it's above the
xfs_buf_iodone_error() function now.

I had to break up the IO error handling because the log item error
callbacks for the items attached to the buffer needed to be called
only if we want the higher level to issue retries. Later in this
series we end up with different retry error marking for each type of
buffer, but we only want to do that when the error handling code
itself hasn't done an immediate retry or marked it as a permanent
error.

So I had to break up the function in separate parts so that the
caller could tell exactly what action it needed to take on a
failure.

I can change it to use an enum. I wrote this expecting that this
code will get further factored and moved to xfs_buf.c once all the
mods have been made and everything settles down. That's about 3-4
patch series down the road at this point, though, so <shrug>. At
least changes in this patch largely don't affect the rest of this
patchset....

Cheers,

Dave.
