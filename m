What version and where do I get it?

Hmmm - isn't mdtest a MPI benchmark intended for highly concurrent
metadata workload testing? How representative is it of your actual
production workload? Is that single threaded?

> xfs info:

only 4 AGs, which explains the lack of free inodes - there isn't
enough concurrency in the filesystem layout to push the free inode
count in all AGs beyond the batchsize * num_online_cpus().

i.e. single threaded workloads typically drain the free inode count
all the way down to zero before new inodes are allocated. Workloads
that are highly concurrent allocate from lots of AGs at once,
leaving free inodes in every AG that is not current being actively
allocated out of.

As a test, can you remake that test filesystem with "-d agcount=32"
and see if the overhead you are seeing disappears?

Ok, the threshold is 32 * 128 = ~4000 to get out of the slow
path. 32 AGs may well push the count over this threshold, so it's
definitely worth trying....

Depends.  Sometimes we trade off ultimate single threaded
performance and efficiency for substantially better scalability.
i.e. if we lose 5% on single threaded performance but gain 10x on
concurrent workloads, then that is a good tradeoff to make.

Cheers,

Dave.
