FWIW, this introduces a new mount field that does the same thing as the
m_opstate field I added in my feature flag cleanup series (i.e.
atomic operational state changes).  Personally I much prefer my
opstate stuff because this is state, not flags, and the namespace is
much less verbose...

THere's also conflicts all over the place because of that. All the
RO checks are busted, lots of the quota mods in your tree conflict
with the sb_version_hasfeat -> has_feat conversion, etc.

We're going to have to reconcile this at some point soon...

Cheers,

Dave.
