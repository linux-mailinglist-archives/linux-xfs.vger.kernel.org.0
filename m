Hi all,

The maintainers have been besieged by a /lot/ of complaints recently
from people who format tiny filesystems and growfs them into huge ones,
and others who format small filesystems.  We don't really want people to
have filesystems with no backup superblocks, and there are myriad
performance problems on modern-day filesystems when the log gets too
small.

Empirical evidence shows that increasing the minimum log size to 64MB
eliminates most of the stalling problems and other unwanted behaviors,
so this series makes that change and then disables creation of small
filesystems, which are defined as single-AGs fses, fses with a log size
smaller than 64MB, and fses smaller than 300MB.

v2: rebase to 5.19
v3: disable automatic detection of raid stripes when the device is less
    than 1G to avoid formatting failures
v4: add review tags, update manpages to reflect new minimum sizes

If you're going to start using this mess, you probably ought to just
pull from my git trees, which are linked below.

This is an extraordinary way to destroy everything.  Enjoy!
Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
