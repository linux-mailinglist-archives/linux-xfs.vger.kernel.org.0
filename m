Heh. I started to write that async reclaim would make this go away,
but then I realised it won't because we still do an XFS_ILOCK_EXCL
call in xfs_inode_reclaim() right at the end to synchronise with
anything that was blocked in the ILOCK during a lockless lookup
waiting for reclaim to drop the lock after setting ip->i_ino = 0.

So that patchset doesn't make the lockdep issues go away. I still
need to work out if we can get rid of that ILOCK cycling in
xfs_reclaim_inode() by changing the lockless lookup code, but that's
a separate problem...

Cheers,

Dave.
