Thank you for looking into this - I think you now understand xfsdump &
xfsrestore better than anyone else on the planet.  ;)

One question - what happens if the wrong "root inode" is not a directory?
I think that it is possible from the old "get the first active inode" heuristic
to find any type of file and save it as the root inode.

I think that your approach still works in this case, but wanted to double check
and see what you think.

Thanks,
-Eric
