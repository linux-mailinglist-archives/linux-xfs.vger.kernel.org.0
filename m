AAARRRRGGGGGHHHHH!

That's exactly what I did with the first version and Brian and then
Darrick were both adamant that setting the attr fork had to be done
through xfs_bmap_set_attrforkoff() via formalising "size=0 means use
defaults".

I know, just doing it the way you suggest is simple, obvious and
straight forward and that's exactly the argument I made, but nobody
else wanted it that way.

I don't see any point in splitting it out into a separate patch.
It's dead code, so while I'm touching this exact piece of code. I'll
document it.

We don't pass down the acl/default acl to this function. We have to
pass something down into here for it to do the right thing....

No. I'm not putting a special, targetted one-off
filesystem-implementation specific functions in fs.h even if it only
contain generic checks. There's already way too much crap in fs.h,
and this doesn't improve the situation. If you have need for it in
other filesystems, then pull it up out of the XFS code in that
patchset.

I'll fix that.
