Subject: [PATCH 1/2] xfs: always init fdblocks in mount

Use fuzz(hydra) to test XFS and automatically generate
tmp.img(XFS v5 format, but some metadata is wrong)

xfs_repair information(just one AG):
agf_freeblks 0, counted 3224 in ag 0
agf_longest 0, counted 3224 in ag 0
sb_fdblocks 3228, counted 3224

Test as follows:
mount tmp.img tmpdir
cp file1M tmpdir
sync

In 4.19-stable, sync will stuck, while in linux-next, sync not stuck.
The reason is same to commit d0c7feaf8767
("xfs: add agf freeblocks verify in xfs_agf_verify"), cause agf_longest
is 0, we can not block this in xfs_agf_verify.

Make sure fdblocks is always inited in mount(also init ifree, icount).
