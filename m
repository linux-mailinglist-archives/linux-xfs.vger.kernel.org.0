For this one patch it doesn't matter since the race only happens when
there are multiple threads updating the inode summary counts.  Userspace
doesn't do any concurrent inobt updates, so the fix arriving early ought
to be benign.

(That said, the only thing you have to do if you push -f is let everyone
know that for-next has been **REBASED**, but I agree with the sentiment
of only doing it when it's really important.)
