Ah great to know, thanks!

They share the same problem with fstests when using an alternative log
device, which I pointed out on [0] and [1].

That goes to show that the fstests assumption on a shared data/log device was
not only a thing of the past, its still present, and unless we address
soon, the gap will only get bigger.

OK thanks for the feedback. The situation in terms of testing rtdev or
external logs seems actually worse than I expected given the outlook for
the future and no one seeming to really care too much right now. If the
dax folks didn't care, then the code will likely just bit rot even more.
Is it too nutty for us to consider removing it as a future goal?
