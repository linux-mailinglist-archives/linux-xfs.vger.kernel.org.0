I'm probably missing something, but is this really different?  Either
the mtime update can block or it can't block.  I haven't dug all the
way into exactly what happens in __mark_inode_dirty(), but there is a
lot going on in there even in the I_DIRTY_TIME path.  And Pavel is
saying that AIO and mtime updates don't play along well.

I'm probably doing a bad job explaining myself.

In my series, I move (for page_mkwrite only) the mtime update,
*including dirtying the inode* to the writeback path, which makes it
fully non-blocking / asynchronous / whatever you want to call it at
the time that page_mkwrite is called.  More concretely, my suggestion
is to be a bit lazier than current lazytime and not dirty the inode
*at all* in write_iter, or at least not dirty it for the purpose of
timestamp updates.  Instead set a flag somewhere that it cannot be
forgotten about -- in my series, it's this patch:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/f2ac22142b4634b55ff6858d159b45dac96f81b6.137719=
3658.git.luto@amacapital.net/

and it's a single atomic bit in struct address_space.  The idea is
that there is approximately no additional overhead at the time that
the page cache is dirtied for cmtime-related inode dirtying and that
all such overhead is deferred to the writeback path when it's as
asynchronous as possible from the perspective of whatever user code
dirtied the page cache.  My page_set_cmtime() is completely lockless.

My series is far from perfect, but I did test it with real workloads
12-ish years ago, on overworked HDDs, with latencytop, and it worked.
Performance was vastly improved (using mmap, not write(), obviously).

Maybe that change should be done?  Or not -- it wouldn't be terribly
hard to have a pair of atomic timestamps in struct inode indicating
what timestamps we want to write the next time we get around to it.
(Concretely, page_set_cmtime() would get some new parameters to
specify actual times, and atomic compare exchange would be used to
update the underlying data structure, so it would remain lock-free but
not be wait-free.)
