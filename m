[directly cc the xfs list now because dealing with the debian bug
tracker is just too hard]

No, both configuration directives fail to fix the problem.  I even tried
to selectively disable directives in the service configuration file, but
for whatever reason it still fails even with seemingly unrelated things
like RestrictRealtime=yes turned back on.

The one thing that /does/ work consistently is to add
SupplementalGroups=postdrop, but that makes the whole service fail if
you don't happen to have postfix installed.

Evidently postfix is *really* dependent upon postdrop being a setgid
program and thereby being able to write to /var/spool/postfix/maildrop.
There are some horrifying workarounds like this:

https://github.com/cyberitsolutions/prisonpc-systemd-lockdown/blob/main/systemd/system/0-EXAMPLES/30-allow-mail-postfix-via-msmtp.conf

That advocate for installing msmtp, bindmounting msmtp over sendmail,
and injecting a config file that just relays mail to the localhost MTA.
I guess that works, but YUCK.

I'll play around with this a little more, but maybe email reporting just
isn't worth the trouble.
