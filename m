Yes, I was simply thinking about this while looking at the fsmap-related
code. Since the current for loop always exits after iterating to the
last AG, I thought off the top of my head that the error check for
last_ag might be unnecessary. As you and Darrick mentioned, though,
removing it would increase the difficulty of reading the code and could
also affect future developers.:(

If doing so could bring significant performance benefits, then it might
be worth considering — perhaps with some added comments to clarify? But
in this case, the performance gain is indeed negligible, I admit. Thank
you for pointing that out.
