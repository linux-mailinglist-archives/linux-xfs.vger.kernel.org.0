In my defense, all the "fixes" from me in this series (except for
the one with a fixes tag on it) date back so long ago it was
difficult to identify what commit actually introduced the issue.
Once we're talking about "it's been there for at least a decade" -
espcially for fuzzer issues - identifying the exact commit is time
consuming and often not possible, nor really useful for anything.

I'm also not going to tag a patch with "fixes commit xyz" when
commit xyz isn't actually the cause of the problem just so that
someone can blindly use that as a "it's got a fixes tag on it, we
should back port it" trigger.

That's the whole problem with AUTOSEL - blindly applying anything
with a fixes tag on it that merges cleanly into an older kernel -
and the whole point of having a human actually manage the stable
kernel backports.

The stable XFS kernel maintainer is supposed to be actively looking
at the commits that go into the upstream kernel to determine if they
are relevant or not to the given stable kernel, regardless of
whether they address fstests failures, have fixes/stable tags on
them, etc. If all we needed stable maintainers to do is turn a crank
handle, then we'd be perfectly OK with AUTOSEL and the upstream
stable kernel process....

-Dave.
