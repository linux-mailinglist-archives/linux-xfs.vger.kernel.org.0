I'd say yes - I can think of several scenarios where we make
multiple allocations per transaction (directory and attribute code)
and I think that they don't actually use t_firstblock correctly to
avoid AGF locking issues. i.e. I think that tp->t_firstblock should
actually be tracking the highest locked AGF in the transaction, not
the first AGF we locked...

Right, NEAR_BNO is used because we likely have physical locality
constraints (e.g. seek minimisation by placing related blocks as
close to each other as possible) and potentially other limits, like
the allocations are for per-AG data and therefore must be placed
within the specified AG...

All of the above, and more... :(

yup, I missed commit da781e64b28c ("xfs: don't set bmapi total block
req where minleft is") back in 2019 where that behaviour was
changed, and instead it changes xfs_bmapi_write() to implcitly
manage space for BMBT blocks via args->minleft whilst still
explicitly requiring the caller to reserve those blocks at
transaction allocation time.

Bit of a mess, really, because multi-allocation transactions are
still required to pass both the data blocks + the possible BMBT
blocks that might be needed to xfs_bmapi_write(). I suspect that for
this case the implicit args->minleft reservation is double
accounted...

That one is correct - 4 extra blocks on top of the data extent...

But that one is clearly wrong - we're asking for 16 blocks for the
data extent, and a total block count of the allocation of 4 blocks.
Even though we've reserved 16 blocks during the initial delayed
allocation, we've still got to have 16 + 4 blocks free in the AG for
the allocation to succced. That's one of the bugs the commit I
mentioned above fixed...

Cheers,

Dave.
