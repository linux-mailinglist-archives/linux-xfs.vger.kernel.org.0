At a first glance, I thought about it too, but, there is nothing preventing an
user to mount a filesystem passing sunit=0,swidth=0. So, this means we can't
really rely on the m_dalign/m_swidth values to check an user passed in (or not)
alignment values. Unless we first deny users to pass 0 values into it.

I didn't think about it, thanks for the heads up.

Eh, that was one of the options I considered, and also pointed by Eric when we
talked about it previously. At the end, I thought automatically modifying it
under the hoods was too invasive in regards of changing geometry configuration
without user interaction. Foolish me :P

Thanks for the insights, I'll work on that direction.
