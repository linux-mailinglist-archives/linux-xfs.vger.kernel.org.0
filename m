I think if I found it set on the primary sb I would leave it alone, and
if the bit wasn't set then I'd set it and bwrite the buffer immediately.
Probably we're talking about more or less the same thing...

Clearing the bit has to happen after the bcache purge and disk flush,
because we need to make sure that everything else we wrote actually made
it to stable storage.

Hm, I guess we could export libxfs_flush_mount so that repair could call
that, clear the fields in the sb, and then go ahead with the
libxfs_umount.
