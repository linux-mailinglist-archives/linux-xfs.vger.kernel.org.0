That's not correct - recovery of a set operation has to remove
the INCOMPLETE attr that is was in the process of being built. If
we are in recovery and we don't find an existing entry, we should
just then fall through the state machine to the set operation
as there was nothing to remove.

-ENOATTR/-ENODATA in that case is valid, it just sounds like we
didn't find an incomplete attr to remove and didn't handle the case
correctly.

I think it's the case where we fail immediately after logging the
first SET intent to the journal, and haven't actually logged
any other changes yet. That first intent can only be logged after
the attr fork has been created and logged, so -ENODATA is a case
recovery is supposed to handle for a SET operation.

Ah, so that's likely how we get the situation I suggested above - we
commit the node form expansion without other modifications but
include the SET intent, so if we recover that node form
transformation, we most definitely have a SET intent without an
INCOMPLETE attr to remove...

I'll add it to the list.

Cheers,

Dave.
