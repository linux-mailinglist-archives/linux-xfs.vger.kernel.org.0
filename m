I suppose not.  But why bother setting the fsid at all, then?

Ahh, I wasn't aware of that, beyond a sense that "a lot of
NFS-exportable fses do this, so there's likely a general desire for this
to be wired up."

Noted.

I pondered whether or not we should encode parent info in a regular
file's handle.  Would that result in an invalid handle if the file gets
moved to another directory?  That doesn't seem to fit with the behavior
that fds remain attached to the file even if it gets moved/deleted.

<nod> But does exportfs actually want parent info for a nondirectory?
There aren't any stubs or XXX/FIXME comments, and I've never heard any
calls (at least on fsdevel) for that functionality.
