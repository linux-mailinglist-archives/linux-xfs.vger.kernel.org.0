In xlog_cil_push_work() where we call xlog_state_release_iclog().

Yes.

The subtlety is that we can't issue the wakup on the commit_lsn
until after the callbacks are attached to the commit iclog. When we
set ctx->commit_lsn doesn't really matter - I'm trying to keep the
order of "callbacks attached before we issue the wakeup" so that
when the waiter is woken and then adds it's callbacks to the same
iclog they will be appended to the list after the first commit
record's callbacks and hence they get processed in the correct order
when journal IO completion runs the callbacks on that iclog.

This patch doesn't move the wakeup from after the xlog_write() call
completes, so the ordering of setting
ctx->commit_lsn and attaching the callbacks inside xlog_write()
doesn't really matter. In the next patch, the wakeups move inside
xlog_write()->xlog_cil_set_ctx_write_state(), and so now it has to
ensure that the ordering is correct.

I'll rework the patches so that this one sets up the order the next
patch requires rather than minimal change in this patch and reorder
in the next patch...

Cheers,

Dave.
