I guess that's a set of followup patches at some point. Calling them
'rolling transactions' everywhere would certainly be an improvement.

Yes, in effect that's exactly what it does. The log is at ENOSPC
when we run out of reservation space, and the AIL is the garbage
collector that reclaims used space....

I'll have to remember that next time I play algorithm buzzword
bingo... :P
