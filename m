That's kind of what I was thinking.. set a global flag if/when we come
across the bit set on disk and clear it as a final step.

Yeah, I wouldn't want to have clearing a feature bit depend on such a
significant rework of core functionality. The bit is not going to be set
in most cases, so I'd suspect an extra superblock write at the end of
repair wouldn't be much of a problem. In fact, it looks like main()
already has an unconditional sb write before the final libxfs_unmount()
call. Perhaps we could just hitch onto that for the primary super
update (and continue to clear the secondaries earlier as the current
patch does)..?
