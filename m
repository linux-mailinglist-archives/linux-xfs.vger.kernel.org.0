Yes, /tmp is now private to the test program (e.g. tests/btrfs/001) so
that tests run in parallel cannot interfere with each other.

Expected, yes.  But still broken for you. :(

I can think of a few solutions:

1. Perhaps run_privatens could detect that TEST_DIR/SCRATCH_MNT start
with "/tmp" and bind mount them into the private /tmp before it starts
the test.

2. fstests could take care of defining and mkdir'ing the
TEST_DIR/SCRATCH_MNT directories and users no longer have to create
them.  It might, however, be useful to have them accessible to someone
who has ssh'd in to look around after a failure.

3. Everyone rewrites their fstests configs to choose something outside
of /tmp (e.g. /var/tmp/{test,scratch})?

Any thoughts?  #3 is the least thinking for me, but #1 is the least
thinking for everyone /else/ :)
