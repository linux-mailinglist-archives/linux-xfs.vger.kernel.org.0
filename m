Ah, interesting. I suppose that makes sense if there's tangible benefit.
Would that benefit stand if we created an internal _touch helper or some
such instead of open-coding it everywhere?

Do you mean to leave it in or out?

In general, what's the approach for dealing with dangerous tests that
are no longer dangerous? Leave them indefinitely or remove them after a
period of time? I tend to skip dangerous tests on regression runs just
because I'm not looking for a deadlock or crash to disrupt a long
running test.
