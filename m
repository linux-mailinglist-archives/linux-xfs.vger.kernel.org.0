Hi folks,

In this series are two small changes to debug code that have made
test runs a little more resilient for me over this cycle. One if a
fix to an assert that is popping on an error handling path that
doesn't take into account an error occurring. The other is to
convert a hard ASSERT fail to a XFS_IS_CORRUPT check that will dump
a failure to dmesg and fail tests taht way instead of hanging the
machine by killing an unmount process.

The other patch is a small optimisation to the new btree sibling
pointer checking. This explicitly inlines the new checking function,
reducing the code size significantly and making the code simpler and
faster to execute. This should address the small performance
regressions reported on AIM7 workloads caused by the sibling checks.

Cheers,

Dave.
