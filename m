News to me.

AFAIA, the overall _IO_ that is being built needs to be a multiple
of the logical block size in total size (i.e. bio->bi_iter.size)
because sub sector IO is not allowed. But queue DMA limits are not
defined in sectors - they define the scatter/gather DMA capability
of the hardware, and that's what individual segments (bvecs) need to
align to.  That's what blk_rq_aligned() checks here - that the bvec
segment aligns to what the underlying driver(s) requires, not that
the entire IO is sector sized and aligned.

Also, think about multipage bvecs - the pages we are spanning here
are contiguous pages, so this should end up merging them and turning
it into a single multipage bvec whose length is sector size
aligned...

XFS does, so I just don't care about random users of bio_add_page()
in this patch. Somebody else can run the block layer gauntlet to get
these checks moved into generic code and they've already been
rejected twice as unnecessary.

A slub buffer crossing two _contiguous_ pages should end up merged
as a multipage bvec. But I'm curious, what does adding multiple
contiguous pages to a bio actually break?
