No, any media can report checksum / parity errors. NVME also seems to
do a poor job with multi-bit ECC errors consumed from DRAM. There is
nothing "pmem" or "Intel" specific here.

I would expect this interface to be useful outside of pmem as a
"failfast" or "try harder to recover" flag for reading over media
errors.
