Aha, you have preempt disabled and slub debugging on by default, which
(on the million-extent files produced by generic/175) mean that scrub
takes long enough to trip the soft lockup watchdog while checking the
bmap.  The test eventually finishes, but the obvious(ly stupid) bandaid
of calling touch_softlockup_watchdog merely plunged the VM into
"rcu_sched self-detected stall on CPU" messages and as it's late I'll
set it aside until tomorrow.

IOWs I think I know what's going on but don't yet know how to fix it. :/
