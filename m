Yes, that was one of the intents of this set of changes - to remove
a function pointer that is largely unnecessary. The main point of it
was to clearly separate out the different completions that need to
be run.

That doesn't actually make the code any more compact.

	case _XBF_LOGRCVY:
	       /*
		* If this is a log recovery buffer, we aren't doing
		* transactional IO yet so we need to let it handle IO
		* completions.
		*/
		xlog_recover_iodone(bp);
		return;

Is actually more lines of additional code than just a set of if()
based flag checks. So adding a mask just to make this handling a
switch statement is largely marginal as to it's benefit here.

No. The flag indicates there is a completion to run on the buffer;
having the completion run does not mean the next time the buffer is
written the completion doesn't need to run. i.e. for writes during
log recovery, the flag is a one-shot. It will be set before each
write, and cleared afterwards. For something like inode cluster
buffers, it will be set when the inode is attached to the buffer,
and cleared when there are no more inodes attached to it. There may
be hundreds of IO completions run on the buffer between attach and
detatch, so clearing the _XBF_INODES flag in xfs_buf_ioend_finish()
is completely wrong.

i.e. the flag is not managed by the buffer cache infrastructure; it's
owned by the subsystem that is attaching things to the buffer...

Cheers,

Dave.
