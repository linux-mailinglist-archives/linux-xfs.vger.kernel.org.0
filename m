Yes, I would have thought the second fallocate should be a noop.

That would be an obvious approach. Unfortunately it's not that easy. The 
problem is associated with one specific client which is out of my control 
so I can't experiment in a controlled environment. The app runs for 
several hours in multiple phases, each with multiple threads, and the 
problem typically occurs in the early hours of the morning after several 
hours of running, so attaching to the correct instance is fraught, and the 
strace output will be voluminous.

Cheers,

Chris
