This isn't about writes during the hole punching, this is about writes
once the hole is punched. For example, the test case I've posted
creates the following file layout with 1k blocksize:

  DDDD DDDD DDDD

Then it punches a hole like this:

  DDHH HHHH HHDD

Then it fills the hole again with mwrite:

  DDDD DDDD DDDD

As far as I can tell, that needs to trigger page faults on all three
pages. I did get these on ext4; judging from the fact that xfs works,
the also seem to occur there; but on gfs2, page_mkwrite isn't called
for the two partially mapped pages, only for the page in the middle
that's entirely within the hole. And I don't see where those pages are
marked read-only; it appears like pagecache_isize_extended isn't
called on ext4 or xfs. So how does this work there?

Yes, but that unfortunately doesn't answer my question.
