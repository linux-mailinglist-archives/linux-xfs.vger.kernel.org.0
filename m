From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

Reaping blocks after a repair is a complicated affair involving a lot of
rmap btree lookups and figuring out if we're going to unmap or free old
metadata blocks that might be crosslinked.  Eventually, we will need to
be able to reap per-AG metadata blocks, bmbt blocks from inode forks,
garbage CoW staging extents, and (even later) blocks from btrees rooted
in inodes.  This results in a lot of reaping code, so we might as well
split that off while it's easy.

+ * Disposal of Blocks from Old Metadata
+ *
+ * Now that we've constructed a new btree to replace the damaged one, we want
+ * to dispose of the blocks that (we think) the old btree was using.
+ * Previously, we used the rmapbt to collect the extents (bitmap) with the
+ * rmap owner corresponding to the tree we rebuilt, collected extents for any
+ * blocks with the same rmap owner that are owned by another data structure
+ * (sublist), and subtracted sublist from bitmap.  In theory the extents
+ * remaining in bitmap are the old btree's blocks.
+ *
+ * Unfortunately, it's possible that the btree was crosslinked with other
+ * blocks on disk.  The rmap data can tell us if there are multiple owners, so
+ * if the rmapbt says there is an owner of this block other than @oinfo, then
+ * the block is crosslinked.  Remove the reverse mapping and continue.
+ *
+ * If there is one rmap record, we can free the block, which removes the
+ * reverse mapping but doesn't add the block to the free space.  Our repair
+ * strategy is to hope the other metadata objects crosslinked on this block
+ * will be rebuilt (atop different blocks), thereby removing all the cross
+ * links.
+ *
+ * If there are no rmap records at all, we also free the block.  If the btree
+ * being rebuilt lives in the free space (bnobt/cntbt/rmapbt) then there isn't
+ * supposed to be a rmap record and everything is ok.  For other btrees there
+ * had to have been an rmap entry for the block to have ended up on @bitmap,
+ * so if it's gone now there's something wrong and the fs will shut down.
+ *
+ * Note: If there are multiple rmap records with only the same rmap owner as
+ * the btree we're trying to rebuild and the block is indeed owned by another
+ * data structure with the same rmap owner, then the block will be in sublist
+ * and therefore doesn't need disposal.  If there are multiple rmap records
+ * with only the same rmap owner but the block is not owned by something with
+ * the same rmap owner, the block will be freed.
+ *
+ * The caller is responsible for locking the AG headers for the entire rebuild
+ * operation so that nothing else can sneak in and change the AG state while
+ * we're not looking.  We also assume that the caller already invalidated any
+ * buffers associated with @bitmap.
