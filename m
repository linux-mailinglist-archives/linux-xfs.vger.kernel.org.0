Why not combine these?

if (*sunit != 0 && (*sunit > *swidth || *swidth % *sunit != 0)) {

Aside from that the code looks fine I guess...

Admittedly I wondered if "refactor all these checks" would fall apart
because each tool has its own slightly different reporting and logging
requirements.  You could make a checker function return an enum of what
it's mad about and each caller could either have a message catalogue or
just bail depending on the circumstances, but now I've probably
overengineered the corner case catching code.
