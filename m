Yeah, I'd like to tidy the ./check, include the option names. But change the
check option format will affect many users, cause most of their scripts go
wrong suddently, then they need to check and use new option format. That's
why I still not touch this part.

Sure, you're right. fstests can be used to do a simple test, but for regular
test, a wrapper is needed. Darrick has his wrapper, Dave might has his wrapper
too. My team also has our wrapper, (we also have wrappers to run ltp and others).
Different users might have different testing environment, so they might build
different wrappers to connect fstests with their own environment/requirement.

So I'd like to keep fstests as simple underlying test cases, provide basic
testing functions to anyone who would like to run it, try to not limit much
things. But I'd like to let fstests provides more help to each of your testing
requirement. That's my current crude thought :-P

OK, thanks for your reply. I'll double check with Darrick, then merge
one of them :)

Thanks,
