Except that log recovery might be replaying lots of indoe changes
such as:

log inode
commit A
log inode
commit B
log inode
set NREXT64
commit C
writeback inode
<crash before log tail moves>

Recovery will then replay commit A, B and C, in which case we *must
not recover the log inode* in commit A or B because the LSN in the
on-disk inode points at commit C. Hence replaying A or B will result
in the on-disk inode going backwards in time and hence resulting in
an inconsistent state on disk until commit C is recovered.

Inncorrect: we -always- have to do this, regardless of the change
being made.

We can't assume that. This makes an assumption that NREXT64 is
only ever a one-way transition. There's nothing in the disk format that
prevents us from -removing- NREXT64 for inodes that don't need large
extent counts.

Yes, the -current implementation- does not allow going back to small
extent counts, but the on-disk format design still needs to allow
for such things to be done as we may need such functionality and
flexibility in the on-disk format in the future.

Hence we have to ensure that log recovery handles both set and reset
transistions from the start. If we don't ensure that log recovery
handles reset conditions when we first add the feature bit, then
we are going to have to add a log incompat or another feature bit
to stop older kernels from trying to recover reset operations.

IOWs, the only determining factor as to whether we should replay an
inode is the LSN of the on-disk inode vs the LSN of the transaction
being replayed. Feature bits in either the on-disk ior log inode are
not reliable indicators of whether a dynamically set feature is
active or not at the time the inode item is being replayed...

I don't think this makes sense. This groups by field rather than
by feature layout. It doesn't make it clear at all that these
varaibles both change definition at the same time - they are either
{di_nexts, di_anexts} pair or a {di_big_aexts, pad} pair. That's the
whole point of using anonymous structs here - it defines and
documents the relationship between the layouts when certain features
are set rather than relying on people to parse the comments
correctly to determine the relationship....

Cheers,

Dave.
