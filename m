If the cache is a static variable inside xfs_fubar_btree.c, how do you
know which cache to pass to kmem_cache_free in xfs_btree_del_cursor?
Does this imply adding per-btree del_cursor functions and refactoring
the entire codebase to use them?

I was /trying/ to get a dependent patchset ready so that Chandan could
submit the extent counters patchset for 5.16, not trigger a refactoring
of a whole ton of btree code.  If you want to hide the information that
badly, please take over this patchset and solve both the above problem
and then one below.

Something you couldn't have seen here is that the xfsprogs port contains
an addition to the xfs_db btheight switch to print these absolute maxima
so that we won't have to compute them by hand anymore.

Maybe I should have noted both of these points in the commit message?
Though I've also been chided for submitting excessive comments in the
past, which is why I didn't.
