I would say this is monitoring the state of the system more than it's
controlling it.

TBH I thought the bigger promise of the printk index is the ability to
find where in the source code a message might have come from.

I would like to see the problem statement part of this doc develop
further.  What do you think about reworking the above paragraph like so?

"Often it is useful for developers and support specialists to be able to
trace a kernel log message back to its exact position in source code.
Moreover, there are monitoring tools that filter and take action based
on messages logged.  For both of these use cases, it would be helpful to
provide an index of all possible printk format strings for the running
kernel."

Ok.  You might want to make it explicit here that the format of the
debugfs file itself shouldn't change, unlike the file/line/formatspecificer
*contents* of those files.

If ext4 is built into the kernel (and not as a module), does its format
strings end up in index/vmlinux or index/ext4?

You might just call this "printk() is not a stable KABI".
