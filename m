Fine by me. Something like the following perhaps?

"This verifier historically failed empty leaf buffers because we expect
the fork to be in another format. Empty attr fork format conversions are
possible during xattr set, however, and format conversion is not atomic
with the xattr set that triggers it. We cannot assume leaf blocks are
non-empty until that is addressed."
