Hi all,

A code audit demonstrated that many xfsprogs utilities do not check that
the buffers they write actually make it to disk.  While the userspace
buffer cache has a means to check that a buffer was written (which is to
reread the buffer after the write), most utilities mark a buffer dirty
and release it to the MRU and do not re-check the buffer.

Worse yet, the MRU will retain the buffers for all failed writes until
the buffer cache is torn down, but it in turn has no way to communicate
that writes were lost due to IO errors.  libxfs will flush the device
when it is unmounted, but as there is no return value, we again fail to
notice that writes have been lost.  Most likely this leads to a corrupt
filesystem, which makes it all the more surprising that xfs_repair can
lose writes yet still return 0!

Fix all this by making delwri_submit a synchronous write operation like
its kernel counterpart; teaching the buffer cache to mark the buftarg
when it knows it's losing writes; teaching the device flush functions to
return error codes; and adding a new "flush filesystem" API that user
programs can call to check for lost writes or IO errors.  Then teach all
the userspace programs to flush the fs at exit and report errors.

In v2 we split up some of the patches and make sure we always fsync when
flushing a block device.  In v3 we move the buffer and disk flushing
requests into the libxfs unmount function.

If you're going to start using this mess, you probably ought to just
pull from my git trees, which are linked below.

This is an extraordinary way to destroy everything.  Enjoy!
Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
