Ha, it seems a bit mysterious, but it's actually much simpler
than it appears.

I think not without a fairly significant re-design.

The main difference is the mount-api will allocate the super
block later than the old mount code.

Basically, if file system parameter parsing fails the super
block won't get allocated.

So the super block isn't available during parameter parsing
but the file system private data structure may be needed for
it, so it comes from the file system context at that point.

When the super block is successfully allocated the file system
private data structure is set in the super block (and the field
NULLed in the context) and things progress much the same as
before from that point.

That's the essential difference in the process AFAICS.

By the time fill_super() is called everything is set and you
should be able to proceed almost the same as before.
