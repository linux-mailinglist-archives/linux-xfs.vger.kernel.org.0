So "leaf_mnr" is supposed to be the minimum number of records in
a leaf?

But this gets passed mp->m_rmap_mnr[1], which is the minimum number
of keys/ptrs in a node, not a leaf. I'm confused.

Yup, I'm definitely confused. We also have:

xfs_btree_calc_size(limits, len)
xfs_btree_compute_maxlevels(limits, len)

And they do something similar but subtly different. They aren't
clearly documented, either, so from reading the code:

xfs_btree_calc_size is calculating the btree block usage for a
discrete count of items based on the leaf and node population values
from mp->m_rmap_mnr, etc. It uses a division based algorithm

	recs = limits[0]	// min recs per block
	for (level = 0; len > 1; level++) {
		do_div(len, recs)
		recs = limits[1]	// min ptrs per node
		rval += len;
	}
	return rval

(why does this even calculate level?)

So it returns the number of blocks the btree will consume to
index a given number of discrete blocks.

xfs_btree_compute_maxlevels() is basically:

	len = len / limits[0]		// record blocks in level 0
	for (level = 1; len > 1; level++)
		len = len / limits[1]	// node blocks in level n
	return level

So it returns how many levels are required to index a specific
number of discrete blocks given a specific leaf/node population.

But what does xfs_btree_compute_maxlevels_size do? I'm really not
sure from the desription, the calculation or the parameters passed
to it. Even a table doesn't tell me:

say 10000 records, leaf_mnr = 10

loop		blocks_left	leaf_blocks	max_levels
0 (at init)		9999		10		1
1			9989	       100		2
2			9889	      1000		3
3			8889	     10000		4
Breaks out on (leaf_blocks > blocks_left)

So, after much head scratching, I *think* what this function is
trying to do is take into account the case where we have a single
block shared by reflink N times, such that the entire AG is made up
of rmap records pointing to all the owners.  We're trying to
determine the size is the height of the tree if we index enough leaf
records to consume all the free space in the AG?

Which then means we don't care what the number of records are in the
leaf nodes, we only need to know how many leaf blocks there are and
how many interior nodes we consume to index them?

IOWs, we're counting the number of leaf blocks we can index at each
level based on the _minimum number of pointers_ we can hold in a
_node_?

If so, then the naming leaves a lot to be desired here. The
variables all being named "leaf" even though they are being passed
node limits and are calculating node level indexing limits and not
leaf space consumption completely threw me in the wrong direction.
I just spent the best part of 90 minutes working all this out
from first principles because nothing is obvious about why this code
is correct. Everything screamed "wrong wrong wrong" at me until
I finally understood what was being calculated. And now I know, it
still screams "wrong wrong wrong" at me.

So:

/*
 * Given a number of available blocks for the btree to consume with
 * records and pointers, calculate the height of the tree needed to
 * index all the records that space can hold based on the number of
 * pointers each interior node holds.
 *
 * We start by assuming a single level tree consumes a single block,
 * then track the number of blocks each node level consumes until we
 * no longer have space to store the next node level. At this point,
 * we are indexing all the leaf blocks in the space, and there's no
 * more free space to split the tree any further. That's our maximum
 * btree height.
 */
unsigned int
xfs_btree_space_to_height(
	unsigned int		*limits,
	unsigned long long	leaf_blocks)
{
	unsigned long long	node_blocks = limits[1];
	unsigned long long	blocks_left = leaf_blocks - 1;
	unsigned int		height = 1;

	if (leaf_blocks < 1)
		return 0;

	while (node_blocks < blocks_left) {
		height++;
		blocks_left -= node_blocks;
		node_blocks *= limits[1];
	}

	return height;
}

Oh, yeah, I made the parameters the same as the other btree
height/size functions, too, because....

This just looks weird with the same parameters in reverse order to
these two functions...

Also, this function becomes simpler if it just returns the maxlevels
value and the caller writes it into mp->m_rmap_maxlevels.

Why play games like this? We want the reservations to go down in
size if the btrees don't reach "XFS_OLD_REFLINK_RMAP_MAXLEVELS"
size. The reason isn't mentioned in the commit message...
