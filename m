I think the comment is still relevant for SYNCING|IOERROR state,
so I s/ABORT/ERROR/

Yes, I started cleaning that up (eg. using XLOG_FORCED_SHUTDOWN
instead of checking the IOERROR state of the first iclog for
shutdown) but it's not that simple unfortunately - it's a bit of a
mess - and so I dropped that from the series to get the fixes out.
I have an idea of what is wrong, but it's not ready yet.

Fixed.

FWIW, I started cleaning that up to with xlog_for_each_iclog()
for all the places where we iterate like this. But that's also
dependent on the IOERROR cleanup I shelved for the moment....

Which one if missing?
