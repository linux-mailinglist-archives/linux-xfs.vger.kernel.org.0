I think so, yes. There will also be more tests coming into fstests.

Imho, backporting this patch is useful. It fixes a basic issue.
What Dave mentioned is that if ACLs/umask are in play things become
order dependent I've pointed out on the patch that aims to fix this: If
no ACLs are supported then umask is stripped in vfs and if they are it's
stripped in the fs. So if umask strips S_IXGRP in the vfs then no setgid
bit is inherited. If it's stripped in the fs post inode_init_owner()
setgid bit is tripped and thus not inherited.. The vfs patch unifies
this behavior.
