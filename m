I feel like we're copypasting this sunit/swidth checking logic all over
xfsprogs and yet we're still losing the stripe unit validation whackamole
game.

In the end, we want to check more or less the same things for each pair
of stripe unit and stripe width:

 * integer overflows of either value
 * sunit and swidth alignment wrt sector size
 * if either sunit or swidth are zero, both should be zero
 * swidth must be a multiple of sunit

All four of these rules apply to the blkid_get_toplogy answers for the
data device, the log device, and the realtime device; and any mkfs CLI
overrides of those values.

IOWs, is there some way to refactor those four rules into a single
validation function and call that in the six(ish) places we need it?
Especially since you're the one who played the last round of whackamole,
back in May 2018. :)
