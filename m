I thought about "flushed" but that implies something that has
alerady happened in the past (e.g. XFS_ITRUNCATED) rather than
something that is currently happening. i.e. we are wanting to know
if a flush is in progress right now, not whether a flush has been
done in the past...

Yup, I'll that clean up and the comments the search and replace I
did missed.

Thanks!
