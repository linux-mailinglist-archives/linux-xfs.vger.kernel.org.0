Subject: [PATCH 4/9] xfs: cover the log during log quiesce

The log quiesce mechanism historically terminates by marking the log
clean with an unmount record. The primary objective is to indicate
that log recovery is no longer required after the quiesce has
flushed all in-core changes and written back filesystem metadata.
While this is perfectly fine, it is somewhat hacky as currently used
in certain contexts. For example, filesystem freeze quiesces (i.e.
cleans) the log and immediately redirties it with a dummy superblock
transaction to ensure that log recovery runs in the event of a
crash.

While this functions correctly, cleaning the log from freeze context
is clearly superfluous given the current redirtying behavior.
Instead, the desired behavior can be achieved by simply covering the
log. This effectively retires all on-disk log items from the active
range of the log by issuing two synchronous and sequential dummy
superblock update transactions that serve to update the on-disk log
head and tail. The subtle difference is that the log technically
remains dirty due to the lack of an unmount record, though recovery
is effectively a no-op due to the content of the checkpoints being
clean (i.e. the unmodified on-disk superblock).

Log covering currently runs in the background and only triggers once
the filesystem and log has idled. The purpose of the background
mechanism is to prevent log recovery from replaying the most
recently logged items long after those items may have been written
back. In the quiesce path, the log has been deliberately idled by
forcing the log and pushing the AIL until empty in a context where
no further mutable filesystem operations are allowed. Therefore, we
can cover the log as the final step in the log quiesce codepath to
reflect that all previously active items have been successfully
written back.

This facilitates selective log covering from certain contexts (i.e.
freeze) that only seek to quiesce, but not necessarily clean the
log. Note that as a side effect of this change, log covering now
occurs when cleaning the log as well. This is harmless, facilitates
subsequent cleanups, and is mostly temporary as various operations
switch to use explicit log covering.
