Isn't the branch all new?

Anyway, this fixes skipping the tests when not supported, and runs them
fine when supported:

Reviewed-by: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>
Tested-by: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>

although I wonder a bit if keeping functionality not actually supported
upstream in upstream xfstests is such a good idea.  Keeping it in
a development branch for the feature seems more flexible to me.  I guess
there is no point doing a forth and back for this one now, but maybe
should be more careful in the future.
