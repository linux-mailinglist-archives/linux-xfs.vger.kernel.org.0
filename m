because libxfs sync is automated, and wrappers are not.  Darrick tried, but
despite his best efforts my suckiness prevailed spectacularly this time.

Anyway my worry was about 3rd parties directly using the ioctl definition
but I guess I've been convinced that I don't need to worry about that because
it's not for 3rd party consumption in general.

Yup, thanks for checking that.

Yeah fair.
