Because we pretty much got rid of the buffer/buftarg abstraction
from the log IO code completely by going direct to bios. The async
flush goes direct to bios like the rest of the log code does. And
given that xfs_blkdev_issue_flush() is just a one line wrapper
around the blkdev interface, it just seems totally weird to wrap it
differently to other interfaces that go direct to the bios and block
devices.

Part of the problem here is that we've completely screwed up the
separation/abstraction of the log from the xfs_mount and buftargs.
The log just doesn't use buftargs anymore except as a holder of the
log bdev, and the only other interaction it has with them is when
the metadata device cache needs to be invalidated after log recovery
and during unmount.

It just doesn't make sense to me to have bdev flush interfaces that
the log uses hidden behind an abstraction that the rest of the
log subsystem doesn't use...

Cheers,

Dave.
