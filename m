I am very sorry for introducing a new issue and causing you inconvenience.
The issue fixed by commit 8ee81ed581ff was triggered by doing our syzkaller
testing，and my intention is to fix the issue without any malice and offend.

I fully agree with you that we should be more cautious in modifying the code
that was originally working well. I will do more self code review and 
test before
sending patches to upstream.
