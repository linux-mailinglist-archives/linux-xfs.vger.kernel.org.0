Ok, I think we had a small misunderstanding there. I was trying to
say the asserts that were in the first patch were fine, but we
didn't really need any more because the new asserts mostly matched
an existing pattern.

I wasn't suggesting that we do this everywhere:

.... because we've already checked this in xfs_ialloc_read_agi() a
few lines of code back up the function.

That's the pattern I was refering to - we tend to check
relationships when they are first brought into a context, then we
don't need to check them again in that context.  Hence the asserts
in xfs_ialloc_read_agi() and xfs_alloc_read_agf() effectively cover
all the places where we pull the pag from those buffers, and so
there's no need to validate the correct perag is attached to the
buffer every time we access it....

Cheers,

Dave.
