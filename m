IIRC it was pretty difficult to exercise the bug in the first place,
and it was hit because of another bug that was fixed (referenced in
the above commit). There's no real point in fixing this without
fixing the referenced bug, as the referenced bug was the one that
caused all the actual problems...

Cheers,

Dave.
