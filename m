I think that was an artifact from an earlier stage in development where
it was necessary to wake up the reader to get it to drain the event
queue no matter what.  At this point I'd much rather preallocate the
unmount event because...

...the unmount is important, because the userspace daemon uses that as
the signal to quit immediately.  If userspace misses the event then
it'll just keep running forever with a dead healthmon fd.

xfs_healer_start will restart the whole service if someone mounts
another xfs filesystem at the same mountpoint, but if nobody does that
then we'll be stuck with a defunct daemon forever.

Let's preallocate the unmount event, and then this whole thing becomes:

	/*
	 * Insert the unmount notification at the start of the event
	 * queue so that userspace knows the filesystem went away as
	 * soon as possible.  There's nothing actionable for userspace
	 * after an unmount.  Once we've inserted unmount_event, hm no
	 * longer owns that event.
	 */
	mutex_lock(&hm->lock);
	__xfs_healthmon_insert(hm, hm->unmount_event);
	hm->unmount_event = NULL;
	mutex_unlock(&hm->lock);
