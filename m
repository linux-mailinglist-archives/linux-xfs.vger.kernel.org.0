I really hope there's a fstest case coming for this... :)

Wheee!

Looking at xfs_alloc_ag_vextent_exact, I guess the allocator will go
find a freespace record, call xfs_extent_busy_trim (which could erase
the busy extent entry), decide that it's not interested after all, and
bail out without restoring the busy entry.

Similarly, xfs_alloc_cur_check calls _busy_trim (same side effects) as
we wander around the free space btrees looking for a good chunk of
space... and doesn't restore the busy record if it decides to consider a
different extent.

So I guess this "speculatively remove busy records and forget to restore
them" behavior opens the door to the write allocating blocks that aren't
yet free and nonbusy, right?  And the solution presented here is to
avoid letting go of the busy record for the bmbt allocation, and if the
btree split caller decides it really /must/ have that block for the bmbt
it can force the log and try again, just like we do for a file data
allocation?

Another solution could have been to restore the record if we decide not
to go ahead with the allocation, but as we haven't yet committed to
using the space, there's no sense in thrashing the busy records?

Assuming I got all that right,
