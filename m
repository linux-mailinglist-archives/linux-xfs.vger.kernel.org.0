Yeah, I'll get rid of it.

Hmm.  I suppose I could reduce the comment at the same time that I split
out the code that computes the amount of free space that isn't
available.

It will once I turn that into:


/*
 * Estimate the amount of free space that is not available to userspace
 * and is not explicitly reserved from the incore fdblocks:
 *
 * - Space reserved to ensure that we can always split a bmap btree
 * - Free space btree blocks that are not available for allocation due
 *   to per-AG metadata reservations
 */
static inline uint64_t
xfs_fdblocks_unavailable(
	struct xfs_mount	*mp)
{
	return mp->m_alloc_set_aside + atomic64_read(&mp->m_allocbt_blks);
}

/*
 * Estimate the amount of space that xfs_mod_fdblocks might give us
 * without drawing from any reservation pool.  In other words, estimate
 * the free space that is available to userspace.
 */
static inline int64_t
xfs_fdblocks_available(
	struct xfs_mount	*mp)
{
	return percpu_counter_sum(&mp->m_fdblocks) -
			xfs_fdblocks_unavailable(mp);
}
