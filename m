Hmm, do you think this is a reasonable backport of this patch for
pre-5.5?

From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>
Subject: [PATCH] xfs: properly serialise fallocate against AIO+DIO

AIO+DIO can extend the file size on IO completion, and it holds
no inode locks while the IO is in flight. Therefore, a race
condition exists in file size updates if we do something like this:

aio-thread			fallocate-thread

lock inode
submit IO beyond inode->i_size
unlock inode
.....
				lock inode
				break layouts
				if (off + len > inode->i_size)
					new_size = off + len
				.....
				inode_dio_wait()
				<blocks>
.....
completes
inode->i_size updated
inode_dio_done()
....
				<wakes>
				<does stuff no long beyond EOF>
				if (new_size)
					xfs_vn_setattr(inode, new_size)


Yup, that attempt to extend the file size in the fallocate code
turns into a truncate - it removes the whatever the aio write
allocated and put to disk, and reduced the inode size back down to
where the fallocate operation ends.

Fundamentally, xfs_file_fallocate()  not compatible with racing
AIO+DIO completions, so we need to move the inode_dio_wait() call
up to where the lock the inode and break the layouts.

Secondly, storing the inode size and then using it unchecked without
holding the ILOCK is not safe; we can only do such a thing if we've
locked out and drained all IO and other modification operations,
which we don't do initially in xfs_file_fallocate.

It should be noted that some of the fallocate operations are
compound operations - they are made up of multiple manipulations
that may zero data, and so we may need to flush and invalidate the
file multiple times during an operation. However, we only need to
lock out IO and other space manipulation operations once, as that
lockout is maintained until the entire fallocate operation has been
completed.
