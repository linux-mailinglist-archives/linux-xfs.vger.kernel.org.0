Partly.
My question was like this:
It seems that your work is about implementing:
[intent to set xattr <new parent inode,gen,offset> <new name>]
[intent to remove xattr <old parent inode,gen,offset> <old name>]

While at a high level what the user really *intents* to do is:
[intent to link <inode> to <new parent inode>;<new name>]
[intent to unlink <inode> from <old parent inode>;<old name>]

I guess the log item sizes of the two variants is quite similar, so it
doesn't make much of a difference and deferred xattr ops are more
generic and may be used for other things in the future.

Another thing is that the transaction space required from directory
entry changes is (probably) already taken into account correctly
in the code, so there is no need to worry about deferred namespace
operations from that aspect, but from a pure design perspective,
if namespace operations become complex, *they* are the ones
that should be made into deferred operations.

Or maybe I am not reading the situations correctly at all...

Thanks,
Amir.
