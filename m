I'm trying to do a cumulative restore a directory 
from a multi-file backup w/names:
-rw-rw-r-- 1 1578485336160 Oct  1 06:51 home-211001-0-0437.dump
-rw-rw-r-- 1  262411348256 Oct 23 04:53 home-211023-1-0431.dump
-rw-rw-r-- 1    1881207032 Oct 25 04:31 home-211025-2-0430.dump



At first I tried "-i" but once I got a prompt, no files or directories
were visible.

So I tried restoring the full thing:

I'm getting 1000's of messages like where it doesn't seem to be able
to restore the file and instead places it in the orphanage:

xfsrestore: NOTE: ino 1879669758 salvaging file, placing in orphanage/256.0/tools/libboost/boost_1_64_0/doc/html/boost/accumulators/extract/coherent_tail_mean.html

I've seen this before and was able to restore the file I wanted from
the "orphanage" -- instead of installing into the directory
I gave, it gives the above messages.

xfsdump+restore claim to be from xfsdump-3.1.8-1.3.x86_64
from openSUSE with Build Date  : Tue Jan 29 16:46:13 2019

I have also tried this on an empty partition -- same thing.
Why am I not able to restore my backups?
