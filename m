I was following the whitespace example in the various similar macros
i.e. XFS_ATTR_SF_ENTSIZE but if people want spaces that's fine by me.  :)

ditto for degree of commenting on magical -1's; on the one hand it's a
common usage.  On the other hand, we often get it wrong so a comment
probably would help.

No.  I should do that, good point.  Now I do wonder if

                /*
                 * Check that the variable-length part of the structure is
                 * within the data buffer.  The next entry starts after the
                 * name component, so nextentry is an acceptable test.
                 */
                next_sfep = XFS_ATTR_SF_NEXTENTRY(sfep);
                if ((char *)next_sfep > endp)
                        return __this_address;

should be >= but I'll have to unravel all the macros to see.  In that case
though the missing "=" makes it too lenient not too strict, at least.

In general though, auditing for proper "offset + length [-1] >[=] $THING"

where $THING may be last byte or one-past-last-byte is a few days of work, because
we have no real consistency about how we do these things and it requires lots of
code-reading to get all the context and knowledge of how we're counting.

Not really trying to make excuses but I did want to get the demonstrable
flaw fixed fairly quickly.	

Thanks though, these are good points.
