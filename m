I did try to pull the entire compile time assert machinery from
the kernels compiler_types.h in, especially as atomic.h already uses
a differnet part of it.  After it pulled in two more depdendencies
I gave up, but in principle it should be entirely doable.

I'd much prefer to do it in C code and inside the libxfs we build.
If we can agree on that and on killing off xfs/122 I'll look into
porting the more complex compile time assert.

The other option would be to switch to using static_assert from C11,
which doesn't allow a custom message, but at least the default message
isn't confusing as hell.
