I was just speaking generally that this patch looked quite overloaded. I
don't mean to imply it should be separated from the others.

Understood.

I'm not expecting 30 patches. :) The quick flow I noted above, perhaps
with the addition of pushing refactoring changes towards the end, lands
right around 4 or 5 and seems like it would improve reviewability quite
a bit. Of course things change that might lead to more or less once you
get into the details/context of breaking things down...
