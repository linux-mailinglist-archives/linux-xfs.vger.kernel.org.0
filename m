From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

Ever since we moved to freeing of extents by deferred operations,
we've already freed extents via individual transactions. Hence the
only limitation of how many extents we can mark for freeing in a
single xfs_bunmapi() call bound only by how many deferrals we want
to queue.

That is xfs_bunmapi() doesn't actually do any AG based extent
freeing, so there's no actually transaction reservation used up by
calling bunmapi with a large count of extents to be freed. RT
extents have always been freed directly by bunmapi, but that doesn't
require modification of large number of blocks as there are no
btrees to split.

Some callers of xfs_bunmapi assume that the extent count being freed
is bound by geometry (e.g. directories) and these can ask bunmapi to
free up to 64 extents in a single call. These functions just work as
tehy stand, so there's no reason for truncate to have a limit of
just two extents per bunmapi call anymore.

Increase XFS_ITRUNC_MAX_EXTENTS to 64 to match the number of extents
that can be deferred in a single loop to match what the directory
code already uses.

For realtime inodes, where xfs_bunmapi() directly frees extents,
leave the limit at 2 extents per loop as this is all the space that
the transaction reservation will cover.
