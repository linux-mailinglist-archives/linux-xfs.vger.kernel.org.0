None at all, actually -- xfs_scrub uses bulkstat to find inodes to
scrub.  Bulkstat sets I_DONTCACHE on the files it reads, so the VFS
drops the inode (if there are no dentries or the dentries are also
marked DONTCACHE) as soon as irele drops the refcount to zero.

IOWs, the fuzz test can do this on an idle system:

# xfs_db -x -c 'inode XXX' -c 'fuzz -d core.blah random' /dev/sda
# mount /dev/sda /mnt
# xfs_scrub -d -T -v -n /mnt/
Corruption: inode XXX record
# xfs_spaceman -c 'health -c' /mnt/

and spaceman doesn't report the corruption that we /just/ found.

Right.

I notice /some/ increase in health state lifetime.  With the patch
applied the shell code above works as intended (spaceman reports inode
XXX is broken) so long as inode reclaim doesn't run before spaceman.
Because these days reclaim is triggered by the AIL releasing the inodes,
this means that spaceman only has to be run before the next fsync or the
log force expiration.

Similarly, if a different user program open()s the inode after a scan,
then the health state will stick around as long as there hasn't been
enough memory pressure to push the inode out of memory for real.

My development tree also contains a patchset that adds the ability for
inode reclaim to notice that it's freeing an inode that had health
problems, and record in the per-AG health state that some inode
somewhere in that AG had a problem, but that's for a future submission.
This will close the hole that inode health state perishes rather quickly
under memory pressure.
