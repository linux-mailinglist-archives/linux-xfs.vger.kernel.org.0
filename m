So the lack of OOM kills is the result of not having to do RMW and
ratcheting up the reclaim priority, right?

And, {con|per}versely, can I run fstests with 400MB of RAM now? :D

I'm not familiar with simoops, and ElGoog is not helpful.  What are the
units here?

Looks ok to me, provided my suppositions are correct...
