From: Darrick J. Wong <darrick.wong@oracle.com>

On filesystems that support them, bmap intent log items can be used to
change mappings in inode data or attr forks.  However, if the bmbt must
expand, the enormous block reservations that we make for finishing
chains of deferred log items become a liability because the bmbt block
allocator sets minleft to the transaction reservation and there probably
aren't any AGs in the filesystem that have that much free space.

Whereas previously we would reserve 93% of the free blocks in the
filesystem, now we only want to reserve 7/8ths of the free space in the
least full AG, and no more than half of the usable blocks in an AG.  In
theory we shouldn't run out of space because (prior to the unclean
shutdown) all of the in-progress transactions successfully reserved the
worst case number of disk blocks.
