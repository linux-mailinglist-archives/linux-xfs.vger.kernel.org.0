Could you provide xfs_info of the scratch device that reproduces this
problem? I'm curious because I don't recall seeing this, but I'm also
not sure I've run those iunlink tests on ppc64...

So the inactivation transaction commits should basically start to
populate the CIL. At some point we cross a threshold and a commit
triggers a background CIL push (see xlog_cil_push_background()). I'm
assuming that occurs somewhere in here because otherwise we wouldn't
have started filling iclogs..

Ok, so we've sent a bunch of iclogs to disk and the commit record for
the checkpoint ends up in the current iclog log, which remains active on
return from xlog_commit_record() -> xlog_write() etc.

Ok, so that final (still active) iclog holding the commit record is also
holding the ctx.

Interesting, so I think I follow the issue at least and what the code is
trying to do to fix it. I'm not totally clear on what the ideal approach
is as this code is complex and I'd need to think about it some more. My
first thought was perhaps whether we needed a checkpoint size limit or
to change the background push threshold or some such, but the more I
think about that the less I think that fixes anything.

A follow up thought is that it seems somewhat unfortunate that we can
build up and hold so much reservation on essentially a single commit
record and then just let it sit around in-core waiting for somebody else
to come along and ask for reservation for something unrelated. I think a
background log force should eventually come around and push that last
record out, so we're not in that state indefinitely, but IIUC that's a
lot of log consumption essentially unaccounted for until the associated
items land in the AIL.

I'm wondering if we should have some measure (if we don't already) of
how much reservation is tied into a single iclog and use that as an
additional metric to determine when to switch iclogs a bit more
aggressively (as opposed to only based on how much space is physically
left in the iclog buffer). For example, if we end a huge checkpoint with
a commit record in an active iclog that has a cil context attached
associated with a hundreds of MBs (handwaving) of log data, perhaps we
should just switch out of that iclog before the CIL push returns so that
consumption can be immediately reflected by the AIL.

Anyways, perhaps there are other thoughts/ideas on this..
