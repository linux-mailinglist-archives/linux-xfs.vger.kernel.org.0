Darrick, any comment on this? What did you actually run into that prompted
this change?

Still bugs me a little that a manually-sized log escapes this limit, and if
it's needed for proper functioning, we should probably enforce it everywhere.

I do understand that the existing code only validates auto-sized logs. But
I don't want to sweep this under the rug, even if we choose to not fix it all
right now.

Mostly looking for clarification on the what fails and how, with the current
code.

Thanks,
-Eric
