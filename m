I think so.

If the allocation size spans multiple AGs, we know that we'll need
multiple extents by definition. Given that, I'd argue that if free space
were in a state where we could easily align the same file allocation if
it were broken into multiple smaller (sub-AG sized) requests by
userspace, then we should probably be able to align the larger
allocation when the kernel is the one that actually breaks it up. That's
just my .02 though, there's always tradeoffs. :)
