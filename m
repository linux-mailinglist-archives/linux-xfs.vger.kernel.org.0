ok, thanks for the clarification.

Though I've never heard of streaming video writes that weren't sequential ...
have you actually observed that via strace or whatnot?

What might be happening is that if you are streaming multiple files into a single
directory at the same time, it competes for the allocator, and they will interleave.

XFS has an allocator mode called "filestreams" which was designed just for this
(video ingest).

If you set the "S" attribute on the target directory, IIRC it should enable this
mode.  You can do that with the xfs_io "chattr" command.

Might be worth a test, or wait for dchinner to chime in on whether this is a
reasonable suggestion...
