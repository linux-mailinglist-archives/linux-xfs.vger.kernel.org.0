Oh, I didn't know that, thanks for the information.

Just adding to the information above, UFS (and basically most of the disaster
recovery tools), will ignore IO errors as much as it can, as an attempt to read
as much data as possible from the failing devices.

I did another look into the dmesg output you provided, and:

>     > [52819.637179] Buffer I/O error on dev dm-4, logical block 1610612731, async page read

This is an I/O error even below the vdo driver, so as much as XFS is only the
victim here, I am inclined to say again VDO is also one more victim here of a
failing device, even though I don't know much details about VDO driver.

So you really need to check your storage stack to know where the errors might
be.

The HDD itself, the storage enclosure, usb cable, VMWare hypervisor, etc. I
really can't say, I couldn't spot any errors pointing to anything specific other
than generic I/O errors, which essentially means kernel failed to issue I/O
commands to your device. It will require some investigation to determine where
the error lies, that's why I suggested plugging the usb HDD into a bare-metal
machine, so you can start by better isolating the problem.

But XFS there is just the messenger there of some problem with your device or
storage stack.

Cheers.
