I've bisected a generic/006 failure w/ 5.2 + linux-xfs/for-next down
to this patch. The failure takes several forms:

	a) slab page list corruption and endless console spew
	b) failure to verify log record headers finding the header
	  and asserting:

[  607.977165] XFS (sdf): Mounting V5 Filesystem
[  608.014844] XFS (sdf): Log inconsistent (didn't find previous header)
[  608.016296] XFS: Assertion failed: 0, file: fs/xfs/xfs_log_recover.c, line: 471

	c) record corruption being found when trying to verify
	headers.

It's a completely repeatable failure, running on iscsi block device
with a 4k sector size. Change the sector size to 512 bytes, the
issue _appears_ to go away, probably because the different log
sector sizes result in different IO sizes and shapes and so avoid
the issue I think is occuring....

I suspect the problem is here. This chains bios in a different order
to xfs_chain_bio() in the data writeback path, and it looks to be
mis-behaving.

The tracing I have shows this interesting case right before we hit
the bad state:

    53.622521: bprint:               xlog_find_zeroed: first_cycle 0x1
    53.623277: bprint:               xlog_find_zeroed: last_cycle 0x0
    53.633060: bprint:               xlog_find_zeroed: start_blk 0xf0, last_blk 0x10f0
    53.633320: bprint:               xlog_find_verify_cycle: bufblks 0x2000

And the I/O that is now issued by xlog_find_verify_cycle() is:

    53.633321: bprint:               xfs_rw_bdev: s 0xa00140, c 0x200000, op 0

for 2MB of log space to see if there's any holes in the iclog range
prior to the last cycle change. THis is issued as two bios:

    53.633340: bprint:               xfs_rw_bdev: sb prev s 0xa00140 0xa00d10
    53.633340: block_bio_queue:      8,80 RSM 10486080 + 3024 [mount]

The first is 3024 sectors in length

    53.633350: block_split:          8,80 RSM 10486080 / 10488640 [mount]

which we chain to our next bio and submit it. It is then split
and chained in the block layer

    53.633352: block_getrq:          8,80 RSM 10486080 + 2560 [mount]
    53.633353: block_rq_insert:      8,80 RSM 1310720 () 10486080 + 2560 [mount]
    53.633362: block_rq_issue:       8,80 RSM 1310720 () 10486080 + 2560 [kworker/3:1H]
    53.633418: block_getrq:          8,80 RSM 10488640 + 464 [mount]
    53.633420: block_rq_insert:      8,80 RSM 237568 () 10488640 + 464 [mount]
    53.633426: block_rq_issue:       8,80 RSM 237568 () 10488640 + 464 [kworker/3:1H]

and both bios are issued, and then:

> +
> +		data += len;
> +		left -= len;
> +	} while (left > 0);
> +
> +	error = submit_bio_wait(bio);
> +	bio_put(bio);

    53.633465: bprint:               xfs_rw_bdev: sbw s 0xa00d10 0xa01140
    53.633466: block_bio_queue:      8,80 RSM 10489104 + 1072 [mount]

we submit our second bio and wait on it to complete.

    53.633471: block_getrq:          8,80 RSM 10489104 + 1072 [mount]
    53.633472: block_rq_insert:      8,80 RSM 548864 () 10489104 + 1072 [mount]
    53.633478: block_rq_issue:       8,80 RSM 548864 () 10489104 + 1072 [kworker/3:1H]
    53.636267: block_rq_complete:    8,80 RSM () 10488640 + 464 [0]
    53.640807: block_rq_complete:    8,80 RSM () 10489104 + 1072 [0]

So at this point the smaller split bio has completed, as has the second
bio we called submit_bio_wait() on, but the next trace:

    53.640987: bprint:               xlog_find_zeroed: new_blk 0x10c, last_blk 0x10c

Indicates that submit_bio_wait has completed. The first part of the
split bio hasn't completed yet, so we have undefined contents in the
buffer and it finds a zero cycle in the range we were searching. So,
we call into xlog_find_verify_log_record() which issues new IO at
the start of the range:

    53.640990: bprint:               xfs_rw_bdev: s 0xa00140, c 0x4000, op 0
    53.640992: bprint:               xfs_rw_bdev: sbw s 0xa00140 0xa00160
    53.640993: block_bio_queue:      8,80 RSM 10486080 + 32 [mount]
    53.640997: block_getrq:          8,80 RSM 10486080 + 32 [mount]
    53.640998: block_rq_insert:      8,80 RSM 16384 () 10486080 + 32 [mount]
    53.641010: block_rq_issue:       8,80 RSM 16384 () 10486080 + 32 [kworker/3:1H]

And then we see this happen:

    53.651936: block_rq_complete:    8,80 RSM () 10486080 + 2560 [0]
    53.652033: block_rq_complete:    8,80 RSM () 10486080 + 32 [0]

There's two completions for overlapping IOs, and one of them is the
remaining bio that was split in the block layer. And because when we
actually read that record, we don't find a cycle number change in it
or even a complete log record, we get this:

    53.652058: console:              [   53.491104] XFS (sdf): Log inconsistent (didn't find previous header)
    53.653500: console:              [   53.492547] XFS: Assertion failed: 0, file: fs/xfs/xfs_log_recover.c, line: 474

The assert fires.

It looks like blk_split_request() has corrupted out bio chain by
splitting a bio in the chain and not linking it back together
correctly.

It's not exactly clear to me how nested bio chaining like this is
supposed to work, but it looks to me like it is the source of the
log recovery corruption I'm seeing here...

Cheers,

Dave.
