Any suggestions?  I'll try adding a ratelimit to see if that shuts up
fstests while preventing userspace from pounding too hard on
inactivation.

Ok done.

I refactored xfs_perag_{clear,set}_reclaim_tag into a generic helper
that sets an ICI tag on the inode radix tree and the perag radix tree.
This cleaned up a bunch of redundant code, and enabled me to trim down
the inactivation patch quite a bit.  Now each function that wants to set
inode flags does so directly (after taking the locks) and calls the ICI
helper to deal with the radix trees.

Also, refactoring reclaim to use xfs_inode_walk was pretty simple, and I
even integrated (rather heavily modified) code from the "void *args" ->
"eofb" and the "get rid of iter_flags" patches you posted.

<nod> I /think/ we handle this properly, but it's late...
