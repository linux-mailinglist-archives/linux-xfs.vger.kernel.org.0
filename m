I pinged you as early as I would ping anyone else when it's apparent
I'm probably not looking at a filesystem issue.

The problem is here that io_uring is completely unfamiliar code to
most of the fileystem developers that are going to have to diagnose
problems like this in the field.  That's why I spent the time on it
- nobody else in my team or the upstream people I work with day to
day has even looked at this code or has a clue of how it works.

We need to have people who know how this precarious stack of cards
actually works, otherwise we're completely screwed when a user has a
similar sort of issue.  And right now, all I see are big red flags.

This exercise has lead me to realise that that we really don't
have *any* tools that can be used to diagnose io_uring problems at
all. That's something that clearly needs to be fixed, because fo
some reason this crazy io_uring stuff has suddenly become the
responsibility of distro filesystem people are being asked to
maintain and debug...

So saying "you should have pinged me earlier" is a hugely naive
response. It completely ignores the fact that people are going to
have to triage issues like this on a regular basis. And you don't
scale to having every single user ping you to help debug io_uring
problems they are seeing. IOWs, "you should have pinged me" is not a
solution, nor does it absolve you of the responsibility for making
your subsystem debuggable by the expected user and application
devleoper base.

I didn't find anything even remotely useful in the handful of trace
points in the io_uring code.....

... and now you're assuming that the person trying to debug their
application knows exactly how the whole io_uring thing works inside
the kernel so they can make sense of the tracepoint information.
There's no documentation for the interface, there's no design doc
that describes how the async engine is supposed to work, what
constraints it places on code paths that need to be able to run
async, etc.  If you aren't deep in the guts of io_uring all the
time, then working out what the tracepoints are documenting is no
easy task.

As I said, I think it should be at the top of your list.

Cheers,

Dave.
