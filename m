Thanks for the detailed explaination. I had figured out that multiple
checkpoints can end up having the same LSN because they were written to the
same iclog. The value of cil->xc_push_commit_stable is one of the things that
determine if the iclog is supposed to be flushed or not just after writing the
contents of a CIL context into it.

However the "atomic replay" behaviour had not occured to me.

W.r.t processing per-inode NREXT64 bit status during log recovery, I think we
can depend on the LSN comparison that is already implemented in
xlog_recover_inode_commit_pass2() to skip checkpoint transactions (with
different LSNs) which can make an ondisk inode enter an inconsistent state.

Thanks for the commit ID. I will add this to my list of items to read.
