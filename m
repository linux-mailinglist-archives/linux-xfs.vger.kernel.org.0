I think blaming XFS would be excessive even though the API says it only
attempts to allocate the requested number of pages with no guarantee the ex=
act
number will be returned. A glance at the implementation would show it was
trying to return at least one page and the code flow of XFS hints that the =
XFS
developers expected that some progress would generally be made or kswapd wo=
uld
be woken as appropriate. The original intention was that the caller did not
necessarily need all the pages but that's not true for XFS or NFS. While I
could have altered XFS, it would have encouraged boiler-plate code to be
created for NFS or any other user of the API that requires the exact number=
 of
pages to be returned.

The allocator was working as intended but not necessarily working as desired
for callers.

I don't think your .config is at fault. While I could not reproduce the
problem, I could force the problem to occur by injecting failures. It's
possible that the problem is easier to trigger on your particular machine b=
ut
the corner case existed since 5.13. It's an interesting coincidence that a
similar problem was found on NFS at roughly the same time which might indic=
ate
that something else changed to make this corner case easier to trigger but =
the
corner case was always there.
