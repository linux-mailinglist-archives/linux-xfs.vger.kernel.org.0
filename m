Yes.

Yes.  Note that I've added it to my regular testing routine since I
actually /do/ have users of rt volumes now.

I think I understand [this infrequently exercised code path], which
means I don't understand it, so rather than be one of those idiots who
rips out everything he doesn't understand, I thought I'd at least try to
figure out what it did and patch it back together.

So now that I actually understand what that debug code does having dug
around to see what those fields do, I'd also be just fine ripping it
out.  But I wanted to know what I would be tearing out first...
