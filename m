Right, that's the "allocation cursor" structure. I'd eventually like to
fold that into or with the existing allocation arg structure, but that's
something for after the other allocation modes are converted.

Anyways.. this was all buried in a single patch as well that makes it
harder to dig out. For reference, the original feedback was here:

Ok. It's not quite as simple due to the semantics described above. I'm
not totally convinced the generic "active" state would exactly match the
semantics used by the block allocation code. I'd hate to bury it in
there as is and have it end up being a landmine or wart if it is not
ever reused outside of extent allocation (or replaced with something
cleaner, ideally).
