That's what adding the inode BMBT indirection to point at the log
blocks is - it's virtually mapping the physical block location.

Virtual mapping as in "memory mapping the log" is a different
problem altogether. We've talked about that several times in the
context of DAX to avoid at least one level of memcpy() that the log
writes currently do on PMEM systems.

It would have to be a single contiguous extent and correctly
aligned to sunit/swidth as the original log would have been.
Otherwise stuff like log stripe unit IO optimisations get broken.

So a specialised swap extent operation? Currently we can swap
individual extents between inodes (the rmap extent swap code), but I
don't think we can't swap an inode extent with a bare, unreferenced
"free space" extent right now.

And potentially rmap btree updates because the type and owner of
both extents change. There's also the need to mark the old log
extent as unwritten, because if we crash iand recovery doesn't free
the donor inode, we don't want to risk exposing the old contents of
the log to userspace.

Also, Because rmap updates are deferred, the changes will span
multiple transactions via intents, so this will make use of the CIL
and, potentially, commit to the log and insert items into the AIL.

If we get items in the AIL, we are open to metadata writeback
starting while we are still doing the log changeover.  e.g. memory
pressure occurs, direct reclaim causes xfs_reclaim_inodes_nr() to
run which calls xfs_ail_push_all(mp->m_ail)....

Hence if we end up with new metadata changes in place, we can't go
back to the old log - we've got changes that are only sequenced in
the new log, so we can only recover at this point from the new log.

Yes, we can fix all these things, but we'll end up touching lots of
high level code in subtle ways to make this all work, and I can't
help but think this will end up being a bit fragile as a result.

Noted, but as per above, the potential for metadata writeback to
occur before we've switch logs means we can't just go back to the
old log. hence to make sure this works, we'll need new interlocks to
ensure operations like metadata writeback can't occur while the log
swap transactions are being performed.

Yeah, the moment we write the superblock, we have to be prepared to
recover from the new log. That's why I think that both the old
log and the new log should just have an identical "log change"
record written to them after the unmount record. That simply records
the location/size of both the old log and the new log and we can
recover from that no matter which side of the superblock write we
crash on.

i.e. we have the same change record information in both logs and the
recovery action we need to perform only differs by the old log
having to first:

- update the superblock to point at the new log
- switch to the new log
- restart log recovery on the new log.

I think we could make it work, but it my gut tells me it is the
wrong approach.

*nod*

I'm not doubting it could be done, but I feel that it requires
far more high level filesystem structures to be manipulated in
intricate ways than I'm comfortable with.

My main reservation is that using inodes, BMBT and RMAP updates for
physically swapping the location of the log involves layers of the
filesystem that the log itself should not be interacting with. I'm
just not comfortable to tying low level physical log layout
manipulations to high level transactional filesystem metadata
modifications that rely on writing to the log for recovery.

We can - and IMO should - run the physical location swap the
entirely within the log code itself without involving transactions,
log items, the CIL, AIL, etc. The log is capable of writing it's own
records (example: log unmount records), hence we can implement the
physical swap in a recoverable manner at that level without
involving an high level transactions or log items at all.

If we separate the transactional allocation/freeing of extents from
the exchange of the log location, then we don't have to try to work
out how to run a recoverable transaction that creates a
discontinuity in the mechanism that provides transaction recovery
and is completely recoverable itself.

The high level filesystem operation can provide the log with a new
extent that is already owned by the log and will remain that way
through the quiesce process. With that, the log location swap
doesn't need any other interactions with the transaction subsystem -
We just need to be able to write to the old log directly, to
initialise the new log with the same information, and to write the
superblock directly. The log already writes the superblock directly
as part of log recovery, so doing it as part of a log swap isn't an
issue.

Then we can hand the old extent back to the high level code and it
can free it. Once it is freed, we can queisce the log again and the
new unmount record effectively cancels the log swap record at the
start of the log as it is no longer between the head and tail.

Job done, and at that point the filesystem can be resumed on the new
log.

If you want to work out the high level transactional allocation,
quiesce and freeing side of things, I can write the low level "log
change" record and recovery code taht swaps the location of the log.
I think if we separate the two sets of operations and isolate them
within the appropriate layers, everything becomes a lot easier and
it doesn't need to fall on just one person to do everything...

Cheers,

Dave.
