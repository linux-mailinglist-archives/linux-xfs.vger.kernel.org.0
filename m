I left it there because I did want to keep the two variables up to
date for future use. i.e. I didn't want to leave a landmine later
down the track if I need to use num_iovecs in future changes. I've
also used it a few times for temporary debugging code, so I'd
prefer to keep it even though it isn't used.

But if "not used" is the only reason for people not giving rvbs,
then I can remove it...

Cheers,

Dave.
