Single AG filesystems are not a supported configuration.

And there's your problem. Not enough free space for a inode
allocation transaction to guarantee success. Transaction
reservations need to take worst case reservations to guarantee
forwards progress, so if there's not enough space for a worst case
space usage operation, it will fail up front.

XFS is pretty much the worst choice you could make for this
filesystem.

Plus whatever is needed to update the inobt, the finbot, the 2 free
space btrees, the rmap btree and filling the AGFL just to allocate
and track the new inode cluster. THen we also have to take into
account the directory update, too, whihc means we might need to
allocate blocks for the directory data segment, the dir hash btree,i
the dir free space index, all the free space btree, rmap and AGFL
updates that dir block allocation requires, etc.

When we add up the *worst case* space requirement for a file create
operation, it quickly balloons out to be much larger than just the
space an inode cluster consumes.

Your understanding is flawed - large contiguous extents can be cut
down to smaller aligned allocations.

Regardless, there are very good reasons we do not support such tiny
XFS filesystems nor attmept to use every last block available in the
filesystem.

If you truly need a 16MB filesystem for your application, *do not
use XFS*. Use a filesystem that is optimised for tiny devices.

Cheers,

Dave.
