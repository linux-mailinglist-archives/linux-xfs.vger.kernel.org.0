Yes.  There were a rash of corruption problems that got fixed in 6.2:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/xfs/xfs-linux.git/tag/?h=xfs-6.2-merge-8

My guess with no other information is either the write invalidation
problem in iomap; or maybe COW extent allocations racing with the log.

Most of these haven't been backported to 6.1 because our only choices as
a community were (a) let a dumb bot shovel in patches with zero QA or
(b) try to scare up volunteers to backport things to LTS kernels.  (a)
wasn't acceptable, but then with (b)...

...there isn't really a designated 6.1 LTS backport engineer right now.
A couple folks from Cloudflare; Amir Goldstein; and Ted Ts'o have been
sharing the work when they have spare time.
