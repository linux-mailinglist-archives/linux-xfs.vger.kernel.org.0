I personally use "git grep" to find a given message in the sources.
IMHO, it is much easier than going via printk index.

I could imagine that people might use the printk index when they do
not have the full git repo. But it should not be the main purpose
of this interface. IMHO, it would not be worth it. "grep -R" or
google does similar job.

Or maybe I miss some particular use case.

I did not use this paragraph in the end. But I reworked the text a bit.

I rather made it more explicit that the particular messages are not
KABI.

The stability of the interface is kind of political issue. It depends
if there are any tools using it. I will do my best to keep it stable
as long as I am printk maintainer. But I do not want to promise it at the
moment. The interface is still pretty young and there are just first
users playing with it.

It will be in vmlinux when the module is built-in. I mentioned this in v1.

Thanks a lot for the valuable feedback and suggestions. I used most of
them, see
