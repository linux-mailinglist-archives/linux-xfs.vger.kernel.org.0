To what purpose, though? It's being talked about as a way to run a
blockgc pass during freeze on XFS, but we don't need a blockgc
passes in freeze for XFS for deadlock avoidance or correct freeze
behaviour.

Hence I just don't see what problems this complexity is going to
fix. What am I missing?

We've had that behaviour for 20+ years.  There's no evidence that it
is problematic and, realistically, it's not different to the
filesystem state after a system crash. i.e. crash your system, and
every inode in memory that has preallocated blocks beyond EOF now
has them persistently on disk, and they don't get cleaned up until
the next time they get cycled through the inode cache.

Further, we intentionally disable blockgc on any inode that has been
opend O_APPEND or had fallocate() called to preallocate blocks. So
regardless of anything else, blockgc scans are not a guarantee that
we clean up post-eof blocks during a freeze - they will exist on
disk after a freeze regardless of what we do during the freeze
process.

Also, we use the same quiesce code for remount,ro as we use for
freeze. Hence remount,ro leaves all the inodes in memory with
pending blockgc unchanged. The post-eof blocks are persisted on
disk, and they won't get removed until the filesystem is mounted rw
again and the inode is cycled through cache.

And then there's system crashes. They leave post-eof blocks
persistent on disk, too, and there is no possibility of blockgc
being done on them. Recovery does not run GC on these post-eof
blocks, nor should it.

So given that remount,ro and system crashes result in exactly the
same on-disk state as a freeze and we can't do anything about
crashes resulting in this state, why should we try to avoid
having post-eof blocks on disk during a freeze? They are going to be
on disk before a freeze, and then recreated immediately after a
freeze, so why does a freeze specifically need to remove them?

We know how expensive that is: quotacheck has this exact same
requirement.  i.e. quotacheck has to cycle every inode in the
filesystem through the inode cache, and that will run post-eof block
removal as the inodes cycle out of cache.

And let's not forget that the reason we journal dquots is so that we
don't have to run a quotacheck on every mount because the overhead
is prohibitive on filesystems with millions of inodes.

If a full filesystem inode scan is necessary for blockgc, then do it
from userspace. A simple bulkstat pass will cycle every inode in the
filesystem through the cache, and so problem solved without having
to change a single line of XFS code anywhere.

IMO, freeze *requirements* are unchanged from what they were 25
years ago. Freeze is simply required to bring the filesystem down to
a consistent state on disk that is entirely readable without
requiring the filesytem to perform any more write operations to
perform those read and hold it unchanged in that state until the
filesystem is thawed.

A further desirable runtime characteristic is that it is
fast and has minimal runtime impact on application behaviour.

Yes, the implementaiton has changed over the years as we've found
bugs, changed the way other subsystems work, etc. But the actual
functional requirements of what freeze is supposed to provide have
not changed at all.

Yes, up until 2020 it did do inode reclaim, but that was an
implementation detail. And it wasn't removed because it was "crazy",
it was removed because it was no longer necessary for correct
behaviour.

Back in 2005 we fixed some freeze issues by making it behave like
remount,ro. They both do largely the same thing in terms of bringing
the fs down to a consistent clean state on disk, so sharing the
implementaiton made a lot of sense. At the time, the only way to
prevent reclaimable inodes from running transactions after a
specific point in time was to process them all. i.e. inactivate all
the inodes, write them back and reclaim them. That was the problem
we needed to fix in freeze, and remount,ro already solved it. It was
the obvious, simple fix.

Did it cause problems? No, it didn't, because this "inode reclaim"
doesn't affect the working set of inodes in memory. i.e. the working
set is pinned in memory by cached dentries and so, by definition,
they are not on the inactive inode lists that can be purged by
reclaim during freeze/remount,ro.

To put this in modern context, the old code was essentially:

	xfs_inodegc_flush()
	xfs_ail_push_all_sync()
	xfs_reclaim_inodes()

Note that there is no xfs_blockgc_flush_all() call in there - it
didn't touch inodes in the working set, just processed inodes
already queued for inactivation work. And in kernels since about
3.10, the xfs_reclaim_inodes() call simply expedited the reclaim
that was going to happen in the background within 5 seconds, so it's
not like this actually changed anything material in terms of inode
cache behaviour.

Indeed, the commit that removed the inode reclaim in 2020 says this:

    For xfs_quiesce_attr() we can just remove the inode reclaim calls as
    they are a historic relic that was required to flush dirty inodes
    that contained unlogged changes. We now log all changes to the
    inodes, so the sync AIL push from xfs_log_quiesce() called by
    xfs_quiesce_attr() will do all the required inode writeback for
    freeze.

IOWs, it was removed because we realised it was redundant and no
longer necessary for correct behaviour of the freeze operation.
That's just normal development process, there was nothing "crazy"
about the old code, it just wasn't necessary anymore.

As per above: we have -always done that-. We have never run blockgc
on the current working set of inodes during a freeze. We don't want
to - that will perturb the runtime behaviour of the applications
beyond the freeze operation, and potentially not in a good way.

This is how we've implemented freeze for 20-odd years, and there's
no evidence that it is actually a behaviour that needs changing.
Having a bug in freeze realted to an inode that needs blockgc does
not mean "freeze should leave no inodes in memory that need
blockgc". All it means is that we need to handle inodes that need
blockgc during a freeze in a better way.....

That's what I keep asking: what user problems are these proposed
changes actually trying to solve? Start with use cases, not grand
designs!

It was originally defined by the XFS_IOC_FREEZE API on Irix but we
never used it for anything on Linux. We didn't even validate it was
zero, so it really is just a result of a poor API implementation
done 25 years ago. I can see how this sort of little detail is
easily missed in the bigger "port an entire filesystem to a
different OS" picture....

No idea what the original intent was.  sync() is the filesystem
integrity flush, freeze is the "on-disk consistent" integrity flush,
and there's not much between those two things that is actually
useful to users, admins and/or applications.

The only thing I've seen proposed for the FIFREEZE argument is a
"timeout" variable to indicate the maximum time the filesystem
should stay frozen for before it automatically thaws itself (i.e. an
anti foot-gun mechanism). That went nowhere because it's just not
possible for admins and applications to use a timeout in a reliable
way...
