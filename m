If you're willing to give up reflink and pretty much all the
allocation optimisations for storage locality that make spinning
disks perform OK, then you can do this right now with a realtime
device as the user data store. You still have AGs, but they will
contain metadata only - your bulk data storage device is the
realtime device.

This has downsides. You give up reflink. You give up rmap. You give
up allocation concurrency. You give up btree indexed free space,
which means giving up the ability to find optimal free spaces.
Allocation algorithms are optimised for deterministic, bound
overhead behaviour (the "realtime" aspect of the RT device) so you
give up smart, context aware allocation algorithms. the list goes
on.

reflink and rmap support for the realtime device are in the pipeline
(not likely to be added in the near term), but solutions for any of
the other issues are not. They are intrinsic behaviours that result
from the realtime device architecture.

However, there's no real way to separate data in AGs from metadata
in AGs - they share the same address space and there's no simple way
to keep them separate and map different parts of the AG to different
storage devices. that would require a fair chunk of slicing and
dicing at the DM level, and then we have a whole net set of problems
to deal with when AGs run out of metadata space because reflink
and/or rmap metadata explosions...

Cheers,

Dave.
