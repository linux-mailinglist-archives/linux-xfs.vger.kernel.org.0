The initial check (with the shutdown) was originally associated with the
return from xlog_state_release_iclog(). That covers both state checks,
as they were both originally within that function. My impression was
there isn't a need to shutdown in the second check because the only way
the iclog state changes to IOERROR across that lock cycle is due to a
shutdown already in progress.
