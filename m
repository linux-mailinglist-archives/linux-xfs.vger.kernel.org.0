oh also, you're not changing sb_inprogress anymore, right? ;)

Hm.

So most of xfs_validate_sb_common is doing internal consistency checking
that has nothing at all to do with the host's core capabilities or filesystem
"state" (other than version/features I guess).

You've moved out the PAGE_SIZE check, which depends on the host.

You've also moved the inprogress check, which depends on state.
(and that's not really "kernel-specific" is it?)

You'll later move the NEEDSREPAIR check, which I guess is state.

But you haven't moved the fsb_count-vs-host check, which depends on the host.

(and ... I think that one may actually be kernel-specific,
because it depends on pagecache limitations in the kernel, so maybe it
should be moved out as well?)

So maybe the distinction is internal consistency checks, vs
host-compatibility-and-filesystem-state checks.

How about ultimately:

/*
 * Do host compatibility and filesystem state checks here; these are unique
 * to the kernel, and may differ in userspace.
 */
xfs_validate_sb_host(
	struct xfs_mount	*mp,
	struct xfs_buf		*bp,
	struct xfs_sb		*sbp)
{
	/*
	 * Don't touch the filesystem if a user tool thinks it owns the primary
	 * superblock.  mkfs doesn't clear the flag from secondary supers, so
	 * we don't check them at all.
	 */
	if (XFS_BUF_ADDR(bp) == XFS_SB_DADDR && sbp->sb_inprogress) {
		xfs_warn(mp, "Offline file system operation in progress!");
		return -EFSCORRUPTED;
	}

	/* Filesystem claims it needs repair, so refuse the mount. */
	if (xfs_sb_version_needsrepair(&mp->m_sb)) {
		xfs_warn(mp, "Filesystem needs repair.  Please run xfs_repair.");
		return -EFSCORRUPTED;
	}

	/*
	 * Until this is fixed only page-sized or smaller data blocks work.
	 */
	if (unlikely(sbp->sb_blocksize > PAGE_SIZE)) {
		xfs_warn(mp,
		"File system with blocksize %d bytes. "
		"Only pagesize (%ld) or less will currently work.",
				sbp->sb_blocksize, PAGE_SIZE);
		return -ENOSYS;
	}

	/* Ensure this filesystem fits in the page cache limits */
        if (xfs_sb_validate_fsb_count(sbp, sbp->sb_dblocks) ||
            xfs_sb_validate_fsb_count(sbp, sbp->sb_rblocks)) {
                xfs_warn(mp,
                "file system too large to be mounted on this system.");
                return -EFBIG;
        }

	return 0;
}
