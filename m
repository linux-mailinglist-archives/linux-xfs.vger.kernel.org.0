Ok, but that doesn't really answer my question of why can't you set it
at mkfs time? Presumably you have the same access to the storage at mkfs
time as at mount time? I can't really speak to how your dedup stuff
accounts for dynamic changes in relation to existing data that was
placed based an old stripe unit, etc., so I'll just assume that works
for your purposes in the migration case.

Note that Dave chimed in with some historical context on IRC:

...
14:31 <dchinner_> keep in mind that the sunit/swidth mount options were onl=
y added to work around a CXFS client mount bug that caused the superblock v=
alues on disk to get zeroed
14:31 <sandeen> hah, that rings a bell
14:32 <sandeen> still, it's been there for /years/ now
14:32 <dchinner_> it was never intended as a mechanism to actually change t=
he layout
14:32 <djwong> aha, there's the context i was missing :)
14:32 <dchinner_> it turned out to be kinda useful for the crazy md raid re=
stripers
14:32 <dchinner_> but, really, the use it's being put to here is just .... =
not supportable
14:34 <sandeen> usecase aside, it seems that if the kernel code allows you =
to rewrite it, xfs_repair shouldn't choke on the results =20
14:34 <dchinner_> yes, you can do it, but you get to keep all the broken bi=
ts when your crazy storage changes alignments and layouts dynamically.
14:34 <dchinner_> the kernel doesn't validate it properly
14:34 <sandeen> ok so something  else to fix
14:35 <dchinner_> so if we are going to say "you can change it" then the ke=
rnel must validate that it is compatible with the existing on-disk layout
14:35 <dchinner_> i.e. root inode location, ag header location, inode clust=
er size and alignment, etc
...

My takeaway from that is the behavior of updating the superblock from
the mount options could probably be nuked off (as your patch does), but
I'd suggest to get feedback from Eric and Darrick to see whether they
agree or would prefer to maintain existing behavior with proper
validation...
