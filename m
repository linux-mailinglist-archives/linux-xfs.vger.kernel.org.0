<nod> Well I've already moved the if test to the callsite, so I hope
that'll be less confusing.

Oh, ok.  So you want to check the new agbno and new aglen to make sure
that both are within the filesystem and whatnot *before* we call
XFS_AGB_TO_FSBNO, rather than checking the fsblock after the conversion?

I can do that.
