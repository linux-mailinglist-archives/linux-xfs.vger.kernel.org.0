Not easily, but....

... so had I. The name obfuscation needs a completely different
approach for PP enabled filesystems because of the name also being
embedded in non-user visible structures and potentially changing
attr tree dahash-based indexing.

I apologise for not being able to comment on this earlier. What time
I've had available over the past coule of weeks has been focussed on
the parts of the repair patchset that are ready for merge and I've
had little time to follow the progress of the parts you are
currently developing.
