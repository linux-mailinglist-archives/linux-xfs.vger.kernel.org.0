Yes.

Right - it protects manipulations to the CIL log item tracking and
tracking state.  This spin lock is the first global serialisation
point in the transaction commit path, so it effectively sees unbound
concurrency (reservations allow hundreds of transactions can be
committing simultaneously).

Yes, this one protects the current push state.

Yes.
