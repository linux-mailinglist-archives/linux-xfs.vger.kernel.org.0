Hmm.  The most annoying thing about LOG_INCOMPAT features is that
turning them on requires a synchronous write to the primary sb along
with a transaction to log the sb that is immediately forced to disk.
Every time the log cleans itself it clears the LOG_INCOMPAT features,
and then we have to do that /again/.

Parent pointers, since they require log intent items to guarantee the
dirent and pptr update, cycle the logged xattr LOG_INCOMPAT feature on
and off repeatedly.  A couple of weeks ago I decided to elide all that
LOG_INCOMPAT cycling if parent pointers are enabled, and fstests runtime
went from 4.9 hours back down to 4.4.  (Parent pointers, for whatever
reason, got an INCOMPAT feature bit so it's ok).  I was a little
surprised that xfs_log_clean ran that much, but there we go.

A different way to solve the cycling problem could be to start a timer
after the last caller drops l_incompat_xattrs and only clear the feature
bit after 5 minutes of idleness or unmount, instead of the next time the
log cleans itself.

Alternately, we drop this patch and declare an INCOMPAT_RMAPREFLINKV2
feature that wraps up all the other broken bits that we've found since
2016 (overly large log reservations, incorrect units in xattr block
reservation calculations, etc.)
