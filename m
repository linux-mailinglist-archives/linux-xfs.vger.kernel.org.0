I can feel a "But..." is about to arrive....

... and there's the passive-aggressive blame-shift.

As you just said yourself, all the information you required was in
both the cover letter and the patch, but you missed them both. You
also missed the other 3 times this patch was posted to the list,
too. Hence even if that cover letter said "patch 8: CIL log space
overrun bug fix", it wouldn't have made any difference because of
the process failures on your side.

So what's the point you're trying to make with this comment? What is
the problem it demonstrates that we need to address? We can't be
much more explicit than "patch X is a bug fix" in a cover letter, so
what are you expecting us to do differently?

That's not very fair.  If you are going to hold me to a high bar,
then you need to hold everyone to that same high bar.....

.... because people tend to get defensive when they feel like they
are being singled out repeatedly for things that nobody else is
getting called out for.

Cheers,
