Ok. I get that wrt discard.. I'm saying that's why we inserted dm-thin
into the stack, because it had predictable behavior that fell in line
with this particular design quirk of the higher level test program.

I've no issue with changing it so long as we maintain effectiveness of
the test. I'm not familiar enough with the zeroing offloads in the
drivers you mention to know whether that means this test can still run
quickly in the general case, or only with select hardware..?

It's a hack to facilitate test coverage. It would obviously need to be
revisited if behavior changed sufficiently to break the test.

I'm not really sure what you're asking for wrt documentation. A quick
scan of the git history shows the first such commit is 65cc9a235919
("generic/482: use thin volume as data device"), the commit log for
which seems to explain the reasoning.
