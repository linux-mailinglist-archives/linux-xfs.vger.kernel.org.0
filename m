Maybe not, but as a report of "weird unexpected behaviour on XFS"
it could be an XFS issue....

I think this one contains a smoking gun w.r.t. whatever code is
running. Near the end of the first trace comaprison, there is an
iteration of test/cases via getdents64(). They have different
behaviour, yet the directory structure is the same.

Good:

openat(3, "test/cases", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC|O_DIRECTORY) = 7
lseek(7, 0, SEEK_SET)                   = 0
getdents64(7, 0x7f8d106b69b8 /* 21 entries */, 1024) = 1000
getdents64(7, 0x7f8d106b69b8 /* 21 entries */, 1024) = 1016
getdents64(7, 0x7f8d106b69b8 /* 21 entries */, 1024) = 1000
getdents64(7, 0x7f8d106b69b8 /* 23 entries */, 1024) = 1016
openat(7, "compile_errors", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC|O_DIRECTORY) = 8
getdents64(8, 0x7f8d106b6de0 /* 16 entries */, 1024) = 968
getdents64(8, 0x7f8d106b6de0 /* 17 entries */, 1024) = 1008
getdents64(8, 0x7f8d106b6de0 /* 17 entries */, 1024) = 1016
getdents64(8, 0x7f8d106b6de0 /* 14 entries */, 1024) = 968
openat(8, "async", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC|O_DIRECTORY) = 9
getdents64(9, 0x7f8d106b7208 /* 16 entries */, 1024) = 1000
......


Bad:

openat(3, "test/cases", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC|O_DIRECTORY) = 7
lseek(7, 0, SEEK_SET)                   = 0
getdents64(7, 0x7f2593eb89b8 /* 21 entries */, 1024) = 1000
getdents64(7, 0x7f2593eb89b8 /* 21 entries */, 1024) = 1016
getdents64(7, 0x7f2593eb89b8 /* 21 entries */, 1024) = 1000
getdents64(7, 0x7f2593eb89b8 /* 23 entries */, 1024) = 1016
getdents64(7, 0x7f2593eb89b8 /* 25 entries */, 1024) = 1016
getdents64(7, 0x7f2593eb89b8 /* 20 entries */, 1024) = 1016
getdents64(7, 0x7f2593eb89b8 /* 19 entries */, 1024) = 992
getdents64(7, 0x7f2593eb89b8 /* 22 entries */, 1024) = 1016
getdents64(7, 0x7f2593eb89b8 /* 22 entries */, 1024) = 992
getdents64(7, 0x7f2593eb89b8 /* 17 entries */, 1024) = 760
getdents64(7, 0x7f2593eb89b8 /* 0 entries */, 1024) = 0

In the good case, we see a test/cases being read, and then the first
subdir test/cases/compile_errors being opened and read. And then a
subdir test/cases/compile_errors/async being opened and read.

IOWs, in the good case it's doing a depth first directory traversal.

In the bad case, there's no subdirectories being opened and read.

I see the same difference in other traces that involve directory
traversal.

The reason for this difference seems obvious: there's a distinct
lack of stat() calls in the ftype=0 (bad) case. dirent->d_type in
this situation will be reporting DT_UNKNOWN for all entries except
'.' and '..'. It is the application's responsibility to handle this,
as the only way to determine if a DT_UNKNOWN entry is a directory is
to stat() the pathname and look at the st_mode returned.

The code is clearly not doing this, and so I'm guessing that the zig
people have rolled their own nftw() function and didn't pay
attention to the getdents() man page:

	Currently,  only some filesystems (among them: Btrfs, ext2,
	ext3, and ext4) have full support for returning the file
	type in d_type.  All applications must properly handle a
	return of DT_UNKNOWN.

So, yeah, looks like someone didn't read the getdents man page
completely and it's not a filesystem issue.

-Dave.
