Oh, yeah, I just assumed that from the "we have a real link" part of

It makes no difference where we bump the link count as long as we do
it after the xfs_iunlink_remove() call. At that point, any failure
will result in a shutdown and so it doesn't matter that we've
already bumped the link count because the shutdown with prevent
it from reaching the disk...

Dave.
