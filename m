<ding> lightbulb comes on.  I think I understood this better the last
time I read all these patches. :/

Basically, for each item that can be attached to a transaction, you're
assigning it an "order id" that is a monotonically increasing counter
that (roughly) records the last time the item was committed.  Certain
items (like inodes) can be relogged and committed multiple times in
rapid fire succession, in which case the order_id will get bumped
forward.

In the /next/ patch you'll change the cil item list to be per-cpu and
only splice the mess together at cil push time.  For that to work
properly, you have to re-sort that resulting list in commit order (aka
the order_id) to keep the items in order of commit.

For items *within* a transaction, you take advantage of the property
of list_sort that it won't reorder items with cmp(a, b) == 0, which
means that all the intents logged to a transaction will maintain the
same order that the author of higher level code wrote into the software.

Question: xlog_cil_push_work zeroes the order_id of pushed log items.
Is there any potential problem here when ctx->order_id wraps around to
zero?  I think the answer is that we'll move on to a new cil context
long before we hit 2^32-1 transactions?
