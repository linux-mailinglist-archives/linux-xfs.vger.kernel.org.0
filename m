Hmm.. I don't think we're talking about the same thing. If
xfs_attr_rmtval_remove() was broken down into two functions such that
one of the two looks exactly like the _unmap() variant, can't we just
remove the other half when it becomes unused and allow the _remove()
variant to exist with the implementation of _unmap() proposed here? This
seems fairly mechanical to me..

I think doing as much refactoring of existing code as early as possible
will go a long way towards simplifying the complexity around the
introduction of the state bits.
