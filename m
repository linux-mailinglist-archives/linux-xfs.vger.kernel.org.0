For other readers, here are some references on that:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/vfs.txt section "Handling errors during writeback"
https://lwn.net/Articles/752105/ gives rationale

Having thought about that more, I agree.  While read() gave the intended file
contents in my example, there's no guarantee the pages weren't already
evicted.  If the user wants to trust read(), the user can opt to retry with
--reflink=never.  "cp" shouldn't make that choice on the user's behalf.  "cp"
can still fallback to copy_file_range() or read() after EBADF, EINVAL,
EOPNOTSUPP, ETXTBSY, and EXDEV.  I don't know which is better, "halt on EIO
only" or "halt on all errno except the five known-okay ones".

That reminds me of
https://postgr.es/m//20180427222842.in2e4mibx45zdth5@alap3.anarazel.de.  Its
summary of a LSF/MM 2018 discussion mentioned NFS writeback errors detected
and cleared at close(), which I find similar.  I might favor a uniform policy,
one of:

a. Any syscall with a file descriptor argument might return EIO.  If it does,
   it clears the EIO.
b. Any syscall with a file descriptor argument might return EIO.  Only a
   specific list of syscalls, having writeback-oriented names, clear EIO:
   fsync(), syncfs(), [...].  Others report EIO without clearing it.

One argument for (b) is that, on EIO from FICLONE or copy_file_range(), the
caller can't know whether the broken file is the source or the destination.  A
cautious caller should assume both are broken.  What other considerations
should influence the decision?
