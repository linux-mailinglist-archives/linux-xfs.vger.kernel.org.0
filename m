Ah, I meant that parent pointers are a v5 only feature, and so we
don't need a "v4 only" feature bit for it. As it is, we can't use
that specific bit because SGI shipped a version of parent pointers
on v4 filesystems on IRIX under that feature bit that was broken and
subsequently recalled and killed. Essentially, that means
XFS_SB_VERSION2_PARENTBIT is blacklisted and cannot ever be used by
upstream kernels.

No, it needs to be a v5 feature bit - create a v5 parent pointer
filesystem, create some files on it, and then go an mount it on a
kernel that doesn't have PP support. If you can see the parent
pointer attributes from userspace as "user.<binary garbage>"
attributes, then we need to use an INCOMPAT feature bit rather than
a RO_COMPAT bit.

Cheers,

Dave.
