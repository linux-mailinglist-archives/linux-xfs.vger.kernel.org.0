I've used 16 mount option flags and 26 sb feature flags in this
patch set, so there's still 22 feature flags remaining before we
need to split them. This is all in-memory stuff so it's easy to
modify in future. Given that the flag sets are largely set in only
one place each and the check functions are all macro-ised, splitting
them when we do run out of bits is trivial.

I'm more interested in trying to keep the cache footprint of
frequently accessed read-only data down to a minimum right now,
which is why I aggregated them in the first place...

Cheers,

Dave.
