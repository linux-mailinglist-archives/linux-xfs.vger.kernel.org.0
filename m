1. Fix description
In kernel source tree 'fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_format.h', there defined inode timestamps as 'xfs_legacy_timestamp' if the 'bigtime' feature disabled, and also defined the min and max time constants 'XFS_LEGACY_TIME_MIN' and 'XFS_LEGACY_TIME_MAX':

/* fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_format.h begin */
struct xfs_legacy_timestamp {
        __be32          t_sec;          /* timestamp seconds */
        __be32          t_nsec;         /* timestamp nanoseconds */
};
/* fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_format.h end */
/* include/linux/limits.h begin */
/* include/linux/limits.h end */

When the 't_sec' and 't_nsec' are 0, the time value it represents is 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, the 'XFS_LEGACY_TIME_MIN', that is -(2^31), represents the min
second offset relative to the 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, it can be converted to human-friendly time value by 'date' command:

/* command begin */
[root@DESKTOP-G0RBR07 sources]# date --utc -d "@`echo '-(2^31)'|bc`" +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
1901-12-13 20:45:52
[root@DESKTOP-G0RBR07 sources]#
/* command end */

That is, the min time value is 1901-12-13 20:45:52 UTC, but the 'design/XFS_Filesystem_Structure/timestamps.asciidoc' write the min time value as 'The smalle
st date this format can represent is 20:45:52 UTC on December 31st', there should be a typo, and this patch correct 2 places of wrong min time value, from '3
1st' to '13st'.

2. Question
In the section 'Quota Timers' of 'design/XFS_Filesystem_Structure/timestamps.asciidoc':

/* timestamps.asciidoc begin */
With the introduction of the bigtime feature, the ondisk field now encodes the upper 32 bits of an unsigned 34-bit seconds counter.
...
The smallest quota expiration date is now 00:00:04 UTC on January 1st, 1970;
and the largest is 20:20:24 UTC on July 2nd, 2486.
/* timestamps.asciidoc end */

It seems hard to understand the the relationship among the '32 bits of an unsigned 34-bit seconds counter', '00:00:04 UTC on January 1st, 1970', and 00:00:04 UTC on January 1st, 1970', is it there a typo for '34-bit' and the expected one is '64-bit'?

 With the introduction of the bigtime feature, the format is changed to
 interpret the timestamp as a 64-bit count of nanoseconds since the smallest
 date supported by the old encoding.  This means that the smallest date
-supported is still 20:45:52 UTC on December 31st, 1901; but now the largest
