Yeah, I managed to look through some of this code yesterday but hadn't
got back to this. I suspect the disconnect here is that the buffer list
isn't populated until we process the commit record for the associated
log transaction, and that occurs after the check to submit the buffer
list.

So when the commit record of A is seen, the recovery LSN is updated to
32 and the buffer list is still empty, and then is subsequently
populated based on the content of the transaction. From there, not until
we see a commit record for a transaction with a start LSN != 32 is the
buffer list submitted. This is how recovery knows there are no more
metadata lsn == 32 items, and the buffer list may include any number of
checkpoints that start at the current recovery lsn.

In general, this relies on proper commit record ordering which AFAIA
remains a pretty fundamental rule of XFS logging. It seems the confusion
has been resolved in any event, but something that comes to mind as
possibly beneficial to future readers is to perhaps consider turning
this submit check into a small helper with a proper name and any tweaks
that might help clarify the existing comment.

I think Dave's followup comments to invoke shutdown rather than play
games with cancellation make sense, so I'm particularly wondering if we
could just create an xlog_recovery_process_buffers() or some such helper
that could be reused in both places by conditionally doing the
shutdown/submit on error, and then documents everything nicely in once
place. Just a thought, however. It may not be worth it depending on how
ugly it looks.
