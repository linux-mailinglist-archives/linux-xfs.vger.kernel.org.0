I'll have a look later today, but I think Dave is correct that the
summary recalc force code should bail out of xlog_unmount_write without
writing anything.

It's curious that recovery doesn't complain about this, but at this
point we've potentially been writing out logs with oh_flags == 0...

...though now that I look at xfs_log_recover.c, we don't ever actually
look for XLOG_UNMOUNT_TYPE, do we... heh.
