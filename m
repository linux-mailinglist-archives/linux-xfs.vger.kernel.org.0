Actually, they do need to remain attached nowadays, because COW blocks
are accounted as incore dquot reservations so we can't let the dquots
drop until the COW fork gets cleaned out.

Granted I guess I did have a patch that changed the dquot lifecycle so
that they would stay in memory after the refcount dropped to zero, even
if they had incore reservations.

...and now I finally see the plot twist that turns this into the
*Fourth* part of Yet Another Quota Restructuring.  This time I get to
reimplement quotaoff! :P

Yeah, I had wondered how good an idea it was to replace batch lookups
with a list walk...

...but the current quotaoff behavior has /all/ of these problems too.

I think you and I hashed out on IRC that quotaoff could simply take the
ILOCK and the i_flags lock of every inode that isn't INEW, RECLAIMING,
or INACTIVATING; drop the dquots, and drop the locks, and then dqpurge
would only have to wait for the inodes that are actively being reclaimed
or inactivated.

I'll give that a try ... eventually, but I wouldn't be too confident
that I'll get all this turned around before I have to shut the door next
next Thursday.

Yes, that does explain some of the weird test duration quirks I see in
xfs/305....
