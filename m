Sorry, I should have been more clear. I certainly don't insist on it as
an immediate change or to gatekeep the current patch. I'm just acking
the idea, and I think it's perfectly fair to say "more time consuming
than I have time for right now" if you planned to just fixup the test
itself. I may get to it opportunistically someday, or if hch cares
enough about it he's certainly capable of picking it up sooner.

For future reference, I'm generally not trying to tell people what to do
with their patches or force work on people, etc. I realize we have a
tendency to do that. I don't like it either. It would be nice if we had
a clearer way to express/discuss an idea without implying it as a
demand.
