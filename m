It seems rather odd to me to accept a bio here and then init it, but I
see this was explicitly changed from the previous version to avoid an
allocation (I'd rather see the bio in the CIL context or something
rather than dropped on the stack, but whatever).

The NULL or no NULL debate aside, this should be consistent with the
logic in the callback (IMO, just check for NULL here as Chandan
suggested). With that fixed up, one way or the other:
