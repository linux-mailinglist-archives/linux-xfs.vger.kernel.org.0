Couple of things.

We are talking about btrees and where the record data is being
stored (internal or external). Hence I think it makes sense to refer
to "attribute records" and "directory records" (or "dirent records")
rather than "attributes" and "directory entries"...

"leaves" -> "leaf nodes"

"The dabtree leaves for ...." implies it is going somewhere, not
that you are talking about leaf nodes. :) Perhaps:

"The directory dabtree leaf nodes contain a mapping between name
hash and the location of the dirent record in the external directory
data blocks."

"... store the attribute records directly in the dabtree leaf
nodes."

The userspace readdir/seekdir/telldir directory cookie API places a
requirement on the directory structure that dirent record cookie
cannot change for the life of the dirent record. We use the dirent
record's logical offset into the directory data segment for that
cookie, and hence the dirent record cannot change location.
Therefore, we cannot store directory records in the leaf nodes of
the dabtree....

Thanks for doing this, Darrick!
