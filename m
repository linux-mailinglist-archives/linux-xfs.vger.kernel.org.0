it's also allowed w/o the suffix. so I propose ...

Set quota block limits (bhard/bsoft), inode count limits (ihard/isoft)
+and/or realtime block limits (rtbhard/rtbsoft) to N, where N is a
number representing bytes or inodes.
+For block limits, a number with a s/b/k/m/g/t/p/e multiplication suffix

For inode limits, no suffixes are allowed.

(I thought about adding suffix support to inodes but meh, that's confusing,
what is 1 block's worth of inodes?)
