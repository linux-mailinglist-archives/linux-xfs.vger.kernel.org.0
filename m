I got as far as asking you "where did you get your INI format
specification from?" because the tests assume stuff that I don't
think is valid about whitespace and comment structure in the format.
And then I disappeared down a rathole of "there is no one true
specification for INI files" and then something else came up....

I have not got back to culling the whitespace craziness from those
tests yet. The only format I'm considering supporting is what the
library itself actually supports, and that means random whitespace
in names, values and section headers will be a bad configuration
file format error.

Cheers,

Dave.
