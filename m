Other filesystems (ext4 in particular) haven't been fixed to make
->sync_fs return error codes when the fs has been shut down via
FS_IOC_SHUTDOWN.  We'll get there eventually, but for now I'd like to
get this under test for XFS since we've applied those fixes.

Yes.

No worries -- the history of the sync variants has been very messy and
confusing even to people on fsdevel.
