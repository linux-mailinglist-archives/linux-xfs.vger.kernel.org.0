Ok, so you properly fixed the problem on the DM layer.

If you notice any problem with this that you're trying to fix, or if
this change improves anything, please specify that in the commit message
 - also addressing comments by Christoph, i.e. xfs_rw_bdev shouldn't be
messing with request ops - Just because it has no side-effects is not
a good reason. Regular Log IO being throttled by the DM layer is indeed
a problem, but considering the very small amount of data written here
during log recovery doesn't seem a good use of REQ_IDLE.

So, for now, NAK.
