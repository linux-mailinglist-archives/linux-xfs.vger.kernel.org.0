No.

The MMAPLOCK is only to be used in the page fault path because
we can't use the IOLOCK in that path or we will deadlock. i.e.
MMAPLOCK is exclusively for IO path locking in page fault contexts,
IOLOCK is exclusively for IO path locking in syscall and kernel task
contexts.

Using the right lock for the IO context actually matters a lot :)

Cheers,

Dave.
