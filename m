Keep in mind that my original implementation of ZERO_RANGE was
for someone who explicitly requested zeroing of preallocated VM
image files without reallocating them. Hence the XFS_BMAPI_CONVERT
implementation. They'd been careful about initial allocation, and
they wanted to reuse image files for new VMs without perturbing
their initial careful preallocation patterns.

I think the punch+reallocate is a more generally useful behaviour
because people are far less careful about image file layout (e.g.
might be using extent size hints or discard within the VM) and so
we're more likely to see somewhat fragmented files for zeroing than
we are fully intact.

SO, yeah, I can see arguments for both cases, and situations where
one behaviour would be preferred over the other.

Random thought: KEEP_SIZE == I know what I'm doing, just convert in
place because the layout is as I want it. !KEEP_SIZE = punch and
preallocate because we are likely changing the file size anyway?

My concern was about files with pre-existing extents beyond EOF.
i.e. something like this (on a vanilla kernel):

$ xfs_io -f -c "truncate 0"  -c "pwrite 0 16m" -c "fsync" -c "bmap -vp" -c "fzero -k 0 32m" -c "bmap -vp" -c "stat" testfile
wrote 16777216/16777216 bytes at offset 0
16 MiB, 4096 ops; 0.0000 sec (700.556 MiB/sec and 179342.3530 ops/sec)
testfile:
 EXT: FILE-OFFSET      BLOCK-RANGE            AG AG-OFFSET            TOTAL FLAGS
   0: [0..65407]:      1145960728..1146026135 10 (47331608..47397015) 65408 000000
testfile:
 EXT: FILE-OFFSET      BLOCK-RANGE            AG AG-OFFSET            TOTAL FLAGS
   0: [0..65535]:      1146026136..1146091671 10 (47397016..47462551) 65536 010000
fd.path = "testfile"
fd.flags = non-sync,non-direct,read-write
stat.ino = 1342366656
stat.type = regular file
stat.size = 16777216
stat.blocks = 65536
fsxattr.xflags = 0x2 [-p--------------]
fsxattr.projid = 0
fsxattr.extsize = 0
fsxattr.cowextsize = 0
fsxattr.nextents = 1
fsxattr.naextents = 0
dioattr.mem = 0x200
dioattr.miniosz = 512
dioattr.maxiosz = 2147483136
$

So you can see it is 16MiB in size, but has 32MB of blocks allocated
to it, and it's a different 32MB of blocks that were allocated by
the delalloc because we punched and reallocated it as an unwritten
extent.

That's where I'm concerned - that range beyond EOF is no longer
punched away by this new code, an dit's not unwritten so the
zero_range is going to iterate and zero it, right?

Cheers,

Dave.
