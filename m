I do actually update the base kernel quite frequently - usually
every monday after a -rc is released. This is easy, and rarely
causes rebase issues because all the XFS changes in the base tree
have already been in the for-next tree. i.e. my typical weekly
"rebase" is:

git remote update
for each git branch:
	guilt pop -a
	git reset --hard origin/master # latest Linus tree
	git merge linux-xfs/for-next
	<merge any dependencies>
	loop {
		guilt push -a
		<fix patch that doesn't apply>
	} until all patches applied

If there's no significant change in for-next, then this is all easy
and is done in a few minutes. But if there's substantial change to
for-next, then the problems occur when pushing the patches back
onto the stack...

I've always based my dev work on the for-next branch (or equivalent
dev tree tip) because that way I'm always testing the latest dev
code from everyone else and I know my code works with it.

Yup, that's the "<merge any dependencies>" in the process above.
i.e. someone has posted a cleanup patchset that's going to be merged
into for-next before the work I'm doing. That's where all the recent
problems have been coming from - the pain either occurs at the next
for-next update, or I take it when it's clear it's going to be
merged soon...

Cheers,

Dave.
