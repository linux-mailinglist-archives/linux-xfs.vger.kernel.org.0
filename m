Note that xfs_metadump doesn't include file data, only metadata, so it
might actually be the most time and space efficient way to replicate the
large file. You would need a similarly sized block device to restore to
and would not be able to change filesystem geometry and whatnot. The
former can be easily worked around by restoring the image to a file on a
smaller fs though, which may or may not interfere with whatever
performance testing you're doing.

fstests has a helper program (xfstests-dev/src/punch-alternating) that
helps create fragmented files. IIRC, you create a fully allocated file
in advance and it will punch out alternating ranges based on the
offset/size parameters. You might have to wait a bit for it to complete,
but it's pretty easy to use (and you can always create a metadump image
from the result for quicker restoration).

Yet another option might be to try a write workload that attempts to
defeat the allocator heuristics. For example, do direct I/O or falloc
requests in reverse order and in small sizes across a file. xfs_io has a
couple flags you can pass to pwrite (i.e., -B, -R) to make that easier,
but that's more manual and you may have to play around with it to get
the behavior you want.
