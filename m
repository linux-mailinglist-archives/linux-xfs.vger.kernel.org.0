I don't think this is a good justification for the change. Just
because the unit tests exploit an undefined behaviour that no
filesystem actually guarantees to acheive a specific layout, it
doesn't mean we always have to behave that way.

For example, many tests used to use reverse sequential writes to
exploit deficiencies in the allocation algorithms to generate
fragmented files. We fixed that problem and the tests broke because
they couldn't fragment files any more.

Did we reject those changes because the tests broke? No, we didn't
because the tests were exploiting an observed behaviour rather than
a guaranteed behaviour.

So, yeah, "test does X to make Y happen" doesn't mean "X will always
make Y happen". It just means the test needs to be made more robust,
or we have to provide a way for the test to trigger the behaviour it
needs.

Indeed, I think that the way to fix these sorts of issues is to have
the tests issue a syncfs(2) after they've deleted the inodes and have
the filesystem run a inodegc flush as part of the sync mechanism.

Then we don't need to do.....

... really hurty things (e.g. on high AG count fs) on every fallocate()
call, and we have a simple modification to the tests that allow them
to work as they want to on both old and new kernels....

Cheers,

Dave.
