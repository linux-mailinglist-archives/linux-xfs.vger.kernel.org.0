Nothing currently wakes up reservation waiters on first AIL insertion. I
pointed this out in the original thread along with the fact that the
push is a no-op for an empty AIL. What wasn't clear to me is whether it
matters for the problem this patch is trying to fix. It sounds like not,
but that's a separate question from whether this is a problem itself.

Ok, I figured based on process of elimination. xfs_ail_push() ignores
the push on an empty AIL and we obviously already have wakeups on tail
updates.

And the raciness concerns..? AFAICT this still opens a race window where
the AIL can idle on the push target before AIL insertion.

This (again) was what I suggested originally in Chandan's thread for the
empty AIL case.

Yes, I can see how that would be problematic with the diff I posted
above. It's also something that can be easily fixed. Note that I think
there's another potential side effect of that diff in terms of
amplifying pressure on the AIL because we don't know whether the waiters
were blocked because of pent up in-core reservation consumption or
simply because the tail is pinned. That said, I think both patches share
that particular quirk.

Either way, this doesn't address the raciness concern I have with this
patch. If you're wedded to this particular approach, then the simplest
fix is probably to just reorder the xlog_grans_push_ail() call properly
after processing iclog callbacks. A more appropriate fix, IMO, would be
to either export this logic to where the AIL update happens and/or
enhance the existing log space wake up logic to filter wakeups in the
scenarios where it is not necessary (i.e. no tail update &&
xa_push_target == max_lsn), but this is more subjective...

I described this exact problem days ago in the original thread. There's
no need to rehash it here. FWIW, I can reproduce much worse than 50% log
consumption aggregated outside of the AIL with the current code and it
doesn't depend on a nonpreemptible kernel (though the workqueue fix
looks legit to me).
