From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

In commit 4c5df338, we reshuffled this test a bit in preparation to
disable quotaoff by rearranging the test to testing disabling of quota
by remounting the filesystem.  Unfortunately, extra blank lines were
added to the golden output, leading to test regressions.

The "extra" blank lines are a result of the "echo ; test_off";
test_off() itself doesn't print anything.  Make it print /something/ so
that we know what the test was trying to do when a particular line of
golden output appears, then fix the blank lines.

Fixes: 4c5df338 ("xfs/106: don't test disabling quota accounting")
