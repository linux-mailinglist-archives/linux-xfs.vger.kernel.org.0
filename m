I am not really opposed at it.

Particularly, I don't like the idea of the chance of unnoticed corruptions. And
I'm afraid this will just encourage some users to set fsck.mode=force
'by default', which I don't think is ideal. Not to mention, one of the advantages
of journaling FS'es is exactly avoid forcing a fsck at mount time :)

Anyway, this is just my $0.02, I'm not really opposed to this if people find
this useful somehow to avoid human interaction in case of a corrupted rootfs.
