For example, there are 2 containers executed in a system, which is named as
container A and container B, and these host gives FS-DAX files to each 
containers.
If the user of container A would like to change DAX-off for tuning, then 
he will stop his application
and change DAX flag, but the flag may not be changed.

Then he will "need" to ask host operator to execute drop_cache, and the 
operator did it.
As a result, not only container A, but also container B get the impact 
of drop_cache.

Especially, if this is multi tenant container system, then I think this 
is not acceptable.

Probably, there are 2 problems I think.
1) drop_cache requires root permission.
2) drop_cache has too wide effect.

The current drop_cache feature tries to drop ALL of cache (page cache 
and/or slab cache).
Then, I agree that normal user should not drop all of them.

But my intention was that drop cache of ONE file which is changed dax flag,
(and if possible, drop only the inode cache.)
Do you mean it will be still cause of weakness against DoS attack?
If so, I should give up to solve problem 1) at least.
