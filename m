Yeah, the thing is, right now we have 'unsigned long' as the "wordsize".

And I want to point out that that is not about "pointers" at all, it's
about pretty much everything.

It shows up in some very core places like system call interface etc,
where "long" is in very real ways the expected register size.

So the 128-bit problem is actually much larger than just "uintptr_t",
and we have that "sizeof(long)" thing absolutely everywhere.

In fact, you can see it very much in things like this:

   #if BITS_PER_LONG == 64

which you'll find all over as the "is this a 64-bit architecture".

Out bitmaps and bit fields are also all about "long" - again, entirely
unrelated to pointers.

So I agree 100% that "we will have a problem with 128-bit words".

That would likely be the least painful approach, but I'm not sure it's
necessarily the right one.

Maybe we might have to introduce a "word size" type.

Yes.

And yes:

We should use a lot more explicit types for flags in particular.
Partly for documentation, partly for "we could type-check these".

And in declarations it might be good to encourage use of (helpful)
argument names, in case it really is just an offset or other integer
where a type makes no sense.
