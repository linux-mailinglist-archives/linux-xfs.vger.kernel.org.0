That there are some systems/configurations out there that are fast
enough to avoid this condition doesn't really answer the question. If
you assume something like a 1TB fs and 500MB log, with 1/4 the log
consumed in the AIL and 64MB in the CIL (such that transaction commits
start to block), the remaining log reservation can easily be consumed by
something on the order of 100 open transactions.

Hmm, I'm also not sure the lockless reservation algorithm is totally
immune to increased concurrency in this regard. What prevents multiple
tasks from racing through xlog_grant_head_check() and blowing past the
log head, for example?

I gave this a quick test out of curiosity and with a 15GB fs with a 10MB
log, I should only be able to send 5 or so truncate transactions through
xfs_log_reserve() before blocking. With a couple injected delays, I'm
easily able to send 32 into the grant space modification code and that
eventually results in something like this:

  truncate-1233  [002] ...1  1520.396545: xfs_log_reserve_exit: dev 253:4 t_ocnt 8 t_cnt 8 t_curr_res 266260 t_unit_res 266260 t_flags XLOG_TIC_INITED|XLOG_TIC_PERM_RESERV reserveq empty writeq empty grant_reserve_cycle 7 grant_reserve_bytes 5306880 grant_write_cycle 7 grant_write_bytes 5306880 curr_cycle 1 curr_block 115 tail_cycle 1 tail_block 115

... where the grant heads have not only blown the tail, but cycled
around the log multiple times. :/
