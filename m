Subject: [PATCH 3/3] xfs: terminate perag iteration reliably on end agno
Date:   Thu,  7 Oct 2021 08:50:53 -0400

The for_each_perag*() set of macros are hacky in that some (i.e. those
based on sb_agcount) rely on the assumption that perag iteration
terminates naturally with a NULL perag at the specified end agno. Others
allow for the final AG to have a valid perag and require the calling
function to clean up any potential leftover xfs_perag reference on
termination of the loop.

Aside from providing a subtly inconsistent interface, the former variant
is racy with a potential growfs in progress because growfs can create
discoverable post-eofs perags before the final superblock update that
completes the grow operation and increases sb_agcount. This leads to
unexpected assert failures (reproduced by xfs/104) such as the following
in the superblock buffer write verifier path:

 XFS: Assertion failed: agno < mp->m_sb.sb_agcount, file: fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_types.c, line: 22

This occurs because the perag loop in xfs_icount_range() finds and
attempts to process a perag struct where pag_agno == sb_agcount.

The following assert failure occasionally triggers during the xfs_perag
free path on unmount, presumably because one of the many
for_each_perag() loops in the code that is expected to terminate with a
NULL pag raced with a growfs and actually terminated with a non-NULL
reference to post-eofs (at the time) perag.

 XFS: Assertion failed: atomic_read(&pag->pag_ref) == 0, file: fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_ag.c, line: 195

Rework the lower level perag iteration logic to explicitly terminate
on the specified end agno, not implicitly rely on pag == NULL as a
termination clause and thus avoid these problems. As of this change,
the remaining post-loop xfs_perag_put() checks that exist purely to
cover the natural termination case (i.e., not mid-loop breaks) are
spurious (yet harmless) and can be removed.
