That's interesting. I ran your fio command (without --ramp_time and with
--runtime=5m) against a file on XFS (so no qcow2, no zero_range) once
with sparse file with a 64k extent size hint and again with a fully
preallocated 25GB file and I saw similar results in terms of the delta.
This was just against an SSD backed vdisk in my local dev VM, but I saw
~5800 iops for the full preallocation test and ~6200 iops with the
extent size hint.

I do notice an initial iops burst as described for both tests, so I
switched to use a 60s ramp time and 60s runtime. With that longer ramp
up time, I see ~5000 iops with the 64k extent size hint and ~5500 iops
with the full 25GB prealloc. Perhaps the unexpected performance delta
with qcow2 is similarly transient towards the start of the test and the
runtime is short enough that it skews the final results..?
