Sure, but my point here is that the function returns this invalid
fsbno in *fsbp and assumes that the caller will handle it correctly.

If the caller knows that we aren't going to continue past the
"new_len == 0" condition, then why is it even calling this function?
i.e. this isn't a "decide if we are going to continue" function,
it's a "calculate and validate next fsbno" function...

i.e. the intent doesn't match the name of the function.

Sure, but FSBs are *sparse* and there is unused, unchecked address
space between the AGs that agbno overruns can fall into. And when we
look at XFS_FSB_TO_AGNO():

#define XFS_FSB_TO_AGNO(mp,fsbno)       \
        ((xfs_agnumber_t)((fsbno) >> (mp)->m_sb.sb_agblklog))

we can see that it simply truncates away the agbno portion to get
back to the agno.

IOWs:

	0			sb_agblocks
	+--------------------------+------------+
					(1 << sb_agblklog)
				   +------------+
				   invalid agbnos!

Hence the agbno needs to be checked agains sb_agblocks to capture AG
overruns, not converted to a FSB and back to an AGNO as this will
claim agbnos in the inaccessible address space region between AGs
are valid....

Yes, but that's only a side effect of the agbno having the high bit
set - it could have many other bits set and still be out of range.
i.e. coverting to fsb and back to agno doesn't actually capture all
cases of the next calculated agbno/fsbno could be invalid.

xfs_verify_fsbext() may capture this by chance because it checks
the entire agbno portion of the fsb (via XFS_FSB_TO_AGBNO) against
xfs_ag_block_count(agno), but it won't capture the overruns that
only bump the AGNO portion of the FSB.

Hence I really think we should be checking new_agbno for validity
here, not relying on side effects of coverting to/from FSBs and
verifying fsb extents to capture ag block count overruns in the
supplied agbno....

Cheers,

Dave.
