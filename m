It's subjective. I read it as that the logic assumes all inodes on the
fs are the same version, but doesn't tell me anything about whether that
assumption is (or will always be) true. I find that confusing,
particularly since that's not always the case on older sb versions that
we still support. IOW, so long as the codebase has to handle the common
denominator of non-uniform inode formats (or might in the future), I
don't see much value in using such mixed (feature level) logic when the
per-inode versioning handles both regardless of the particular sb
version policy. Just my .02.

Agreed. This would help mitigate my aesthetic gripe around the whole 'if
(hascrc) { <do some non-crc related stuff> }' thing, at least.
