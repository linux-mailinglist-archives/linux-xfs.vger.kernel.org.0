Hmm.  I'm still a bit confused by what's going on here.  Free space is
heavily fragmented and the bnobt/cntbt are very large, but what actually
triggers the (bug? customer escalation?) report?  Did the fs go offline?
Did fsync() suddenly start emitting errors?

(Sorry, I'm going to go wandering stream-of-consciousness now...)

> > Do the finobt/rmapbt per-ag reservations present similar challenges?

The refcountbt per-ag reservation code computes the difference between
the max btree size and the actual btree size, and subtracts that from
fdblocks.  The rmapbt reservation subtracts the entire reservation from
fdblocks because the rmapbt also lives in "free" space.  The finobt
reservation follows the rmapbt formula, so none of the three btrees
should be directly causing whatever's going on.

So I think the answer to my question is a tentative "no, because those
btrees already subtracted themselves from fdblocks" while I continue to
try to work out what's going on here...

How big is the refcount btree?

As an example scenario (with exaggerated/made up numbers), pretend our
filesystem has a single AG with 100 blocks.  The refcount btree consumes
5 blocks, and the refcountbt reservation is 11 blocks.  Say there are 15
free blocks in the AG -- 6 individual blocks pointed to by the free
space btrees, 4 blocks used by the free space btrees, and 5 blocks in
the AGFL.  (Pretend that we actually need 2 blocks per tree to store 6
records.)

The 5 blocks actually in use by the refcount btree were subtracted from
fdblocks ages ago when we expanded the btree shape.

The (11-5)==6 blocks remaining in the per-ag reservation were subtracted
from fdblocks at mount time, so this AG contributes (15-6)==9 blocks to
the incore fdblocks counter.

Unfortunately, those 9 "free" blocks aren't all free -- we're using four
freesp btree blocks to hold in reserve the 6 blocks for the refcount
btree.  Until we rearrange the free space btree or grow the refcount
btree to consume the rest of its reservation, we're never going to get
those four blocks back...

...and then (continuing the scenario) a 9-block delalloc write comes
along and sees 9 free blocks, so it creates a reservation for 9 blocks.
When writeback kicks off it'll try to allocate those 9 blocks, but only
receives the 5 blocks that are on the AGFL.  Next it... runs around in
circles wondering where the other four blocks went?  Or maybe it just
ENOSPCs, but that's bad because delalloc was supposed to prevent ENOSPC
on writeback.  Either way it's bad news.

Ahh, ok.  I think I grok what this patch does now.  XFS (prior to per-ag
space reservations) counts all the space used by the free space btrees
as free space, which means that a delalloc reservation expects to be
able to consume both the free space in the tree as well as the tree
itself.

Now we use the free space btrees to hold space for future metadata
expansions, so the expectation above no longer holds.  Hence subtracting
agf_btreeblks from fdblocks at mount time.

With that in mind, the finobt and rmapbt reservations are no different
from the refcountbt reservation -- the unused-but-reserved space for all
three reservations are held in the free space btrees, so they all need
this now.  The answer to my question is "yes, they need it too".

With that in mind, should xfs_ag_resv_init be responsible for
subtracting agf_btreeblocks from fdblocks if there are any reservations?

Come to think of it, this isn't quite correct -- rmapbt blocks are
counted in agf_btreeblks and separately in agf_rmap_blocks.  At mount
time, the rmapbt per-ag reservation subtracts the entire rmapbt
reservation from fdblocks (not just agf_rmap_blocks), so this
effectively double-charges fdblocks for the rmap btree.
