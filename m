I wrote patches to do this yesterday, and ran it through testing
overnight. I made a note that I need to do what your first two
patches do, and this morning I was going to completely separate the
DIO unaligned write path from block aligned write path because
there's almost nothing shared between the two cases.

I already commented that I don't like the approach brian suggested
because of the requirement to cycle the ILOCK and duplicate all the
checks that the IOMAP_NOWAIT case already does in the XFS DIO write
submission code. i.e.  I lift ithe trigger for IOMAP_NOWAIT to the
iomap_dio_rw() caller so that we can use IOMAP_NOWAIT for unaligned
IO, and only if that returns -EAGAIN do we run an exclusive IO. THis
also means that we can run sub-block dio as AIO and under RWF_NOWAIT
conditions without explicitly having to check for these things...

Let me rework what I've done on the top of your first two patches
and test it and I'll send it out later today for comparison.

Cheers,

Dave.
