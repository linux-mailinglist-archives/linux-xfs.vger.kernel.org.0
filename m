Not sure this is a driving concern. If you get the same pmem back it
will have gone through a poison clearing cycle when it gets
reallocated. Also, once the filesystem gets notified of error
locations through Ruan's series the FS can avoid allocating blocks
where poison clearing failed.

Fragmentation though is a valid concern.

Alignment constraints were the entanglement that kept DAX from poison
clearing. This is similar to the dance you need to do to get a disk to
remap a bad block, which needs an O_DIRECT write. It was also deemed
messy to keep overloading writes this way.

Sounds good, I'll take a look at the rest.
