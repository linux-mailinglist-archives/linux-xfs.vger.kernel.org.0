Ok, so not the regression I introduced in 5.14-rc1 with the journal
flush/FUA changes (caused by flush vs tail_lsn updates racing). THat
smells like the problem both Brian and I have seen that has occurred
occasionally for some time (I see it maybe once a month here) but we
haven't been able to reproduce reliably enough debug it.

Sounds like it's reliable on your setup? What's your test machine
config?

Cheers,

Dave.
