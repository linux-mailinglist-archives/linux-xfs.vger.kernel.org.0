That's a good place to cleave.

Yup.  Though you ought to read through the offline fsck patches too.
Those take a very different approach to resolving parent pointers.  So
much of repair is based on nuking directories that I don't know there's
a good way to rebuild them from parent pointers.

A thought I had was that when we decide to zap a directory due to
problems in the directory blocks themselves, we could them initiate a
scan of the parent pointers to try to find all the dirents we can.  I
ran into problems with that approach because libxfs_iget allocates fresh
xfs_inode objects (instead of caching and sharing them like the kernel
does) and that made it really hard to scan things in a coherent manner.

If you read through these two patchsets and think they're ok, then
either fold the fixes into the main series or tack them on the end,
whichever is easier.  If you tack them on the end, please add your
own SOB tags.

The fsck functionality exists to prove the point that directory repair
is /very/ awkward if we have to update p_diroffset.  As such, they
focused on getting the main parts right ... but with the obvious
problem of making pptrs dependent on online fsck part 1 getting merged.

Speaking of which -- can we merge online fsck for 6.4?  Please? :)

> [PATCHSET v9r2d1 0/5] xfs: encode parent pointer name in xattr key

Resolving the questions presented by this series is critical to nailing
down the ondisk format and merging the feature.  But we'll get to that
below.

> [PATCHSET v9r2d1 0/3] xfs: use flex arrays for XFS_IOC_GETPARENTS,

I'd like to know what you think about converting the ioctl definition to
flex arrays instead of the fixed size structs.  I'm not sure where to
put this series, though.  If you decide that you want 'em, then ideally
they'd be in xfs_fs.h from the introduction of XFS_IOC_GETPARENTS, but
I don't see any point in backporting them around "xfs: rework the
GETPARENTS ioctl".

(I would be ok if you rolled all of it into patch 25 from the original
v9 set.)

Bingo!

The biggest question about the format change is (IMHO) whether we're ok
with using a hash function for parent pointer names that don't fit in
the attr key space, and which hash?

The sha2 family was designed to be collision resistant, but I don't
anticipate that will last forever.  The hash is computed from (the full
name and the child generation number) when the dirent name is longer
than 243 bytes.  The first 179 bytes of the dirent name are still
written in the parent pointer attr name.  An attacker would have to find
a collision that only changes the last 76 bytes of the dirent name, and
they'd have to know the generation number at runtime.

(Note: dirent names shorter than 243 bytes are written directly into the
parent pointer xattr name, no hashing required.)

I /think/ that's good enough, but I'm no cryptanalyst.  The alternative
would be to change the xattr format so that the namelen field in the
leaf structure to encode *only* the name component of the parent
pointer.  This would lead to a lot of special cased xattr code and
probably a lot of bugs and other stupid problems, which is why I didn't
take that route.

Thoughts?

Hheehhe.  Same here -- rmap was pretty old by the time I started pushing
that for reals. :)

I thought about doing that for 6.3, but I found enough bugs in the
locking stuff (recall the first bugfix series) that I held back.  I'm
not sure about the two "Increase <blah>" patches -- they'll bloat kernel
structures without a real user for them.

Agreed.  At this point, I've worked through enough of the parent
pointers code to understand what's going on that I'm ok with merging it
once we settle the above question.

FWIW the whole series (kernel+xfsprogs+fstests) has been passing my
nightly QA farm for a couple of weeks now despite my constant hammering
on it, so I think the implementation is ready.

I disagree -- I want to merge online fsck part 1 so I can get that out
of my dev trees.  Then I want to focus on getting this over the finish
line and merged.  But then I'm not known for incrementalism. :P
