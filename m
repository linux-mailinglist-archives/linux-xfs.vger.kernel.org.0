Well, this is good timing!  I was wondering whether something along
these lines was an important use-case.

I propose we do away with the 'uptodate' bit-array and replace it with an
'writeback' bit-array.  We set the page uptodate bit whenever the reads to
fill the page have completed rather than checking the 'writeback' array.
In page_mkwrite, we fill the writeback bit-array on the grounds that we
have no way to track a block's non-dirtiness and we don't want to scan
each block at writeback time to see if it's been written to.

I'll do this now before the THP series gets reposted.
