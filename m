The merge window has opened now, so I'm going to pull the critical
LARP bug fixes out of this (patch 2 and 3) because they are the ones
I've been waiting on to publish for-next before an initial pull
request.  I'll plan the rest for 2nd late merge window pull request
once we've got the main bulk merged later this week.

Cheers,

Dave.
