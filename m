Perhaps, but that tends to have impacts on things that run
immediately after mount. e.g. it will screw with benchmarks in
unpredictable ways and I'm not going to like that at all. :(

i.e. I like the deterministic, repeatable behaviour we have right
now because it makes back-to-back performance testing easy to reason
about why performance/behaviour changed...

Cheers,

Dave.
