FWIW, now that this is a 30-line function I don't think it helps at all
to describe what the function does.  We mostly care about things that
might not be immediately obvious from reading the function, such as
preconditions and whatever side effects the function has.

/*
 * Remove a log item from the AIL.
 *
 * The caller must already hold the AIL lock and is responsible for
 * ensuring that the item is in the AIL and ready for deletion.  The log
 * item's LSN will be reset to 0, and if it was the first item in the
 * AIL, the log tail will be updated to match the new minimum LSN in the
 * AIL.  The AIL lock will be dropped before returning.
