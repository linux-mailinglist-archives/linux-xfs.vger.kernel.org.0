They are effectively the same thing, so I think you are splitting
hairs here. The rule is "transaction context is NOFS" so whether it
is set when the transaction context is entered or a few instructions
later when we start the reservation is not significant.

Nope. You're going to need to fix the transaction nesting the new gc
code does before applying this, though, because that is detected as
transaction recursion by this patch....
