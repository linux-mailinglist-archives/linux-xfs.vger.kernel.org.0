I think the intent of the patch makes sense but the wakeup is misplaced.
First, this wakeup technically occurs before AIL population because we
haven't invoked the iclog callbacks yet. Second, your first patch
already adds an AIL push in the log I/O completion path via
xfs_trans_ail_update_bulk() -> xfs_log_space_wake(). The problem may
just be that it's only invoked on tail changes and not empty ->
populated state changes. If so, that could be addressed with a check for
mlip == NULL in xfs_trans_ail_update_bulk().

(Actually, the first patch alone seems to be enough to prevent the
problem in my tests. I suppose I could be seeing a variation of the race
from what Chandan sees and a wakeup from the second CIL ctx ticket
release or something is saving me...).
