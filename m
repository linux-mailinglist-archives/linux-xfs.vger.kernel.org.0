I wanted to keep the -APIs- separate, because all the kernel
atomic/atomic64 stuff is already separate and type checked. I don't
see any point in commingling the two different atomic type APIs
just because the implementation ends up being the same and that some
wrappers are defines and others are static inline code.

Ideally, the wrappers should all be static inlines so we get correct
atomic_t/atomic64_t type checking in userspace. Those are the types
we care about in terms of libxfs, so to typecheck the API properly
these should -all- be static inlines. The patch as it stands was a
"get it working properly" patch, not a "finalised, strictly correct
API" patch. That was somethign for "down the road" as I polished the
patchset ready for eventual review.....

Cheers,

Dave.
