With VLOOKUP in place, why is this better than
(parent_ino, parent_gen) -> (dirent_name)

Is it because the dabtree hash is calculated only on the key
and changing that would be way more intrusive?

Does that mean that user can create up to 2^12
parent pointers with the same hash and we are fine with it?

I don't think it is a problem, just wanted to understand and
ask that the reason for this part in the format be explained.

Thanks,
Amir.
