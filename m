Even in the failure case, we might be able to limit the mount time
scanning that takes place by just scanning until we've found enough AGs
with consumed reservation such that the mount time estimated reservation
succeeds. Of course, the worst case would always be a full scan (either
due to -ENOSPC on the res or very shortly after mount since the res
might have left the fs near -ENOSPC) so it might not be worth it unless
there's value and the logic is simple..
