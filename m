Overall I don't see any red flags, so from that perspective I think
it's good to merge as is. THe buffer cache interactions are much
neater this time around.

Reviewed-by: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

The main thing I noticed is that the deferred freeing mechanism ifo
rbulk reaping will add up to 128 XEFIs to the transaction. That
could result in a single EFI with up to 128 extents in it, right?

What happens when we try to free that many extents in a single
transaction loop? The extent free processing doesn't have a "have we
run out of transaction reservation" check in it like the refcount
item processing does, so I don't think it can roll to renew the
transaction reservation if it is needed. DO we need to catch this
and renew the reservation by returning -EAGAIN from
xfs_extent_free_finish_item() if there isn't enough of a reservation
remaining to free an extent?

-Dave.
