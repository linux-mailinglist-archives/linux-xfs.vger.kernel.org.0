Right. I'll just remove this from the commit message.

All the items in a single transaction have the same id. The order id
increments before we tag all the items in the transaction and insert
them into the CIL.

While true, it's not the way this works so I won't immediately
accept your RVB. The reason for not changing the ordering within a
single transaction is actually intent logging.  i.e. this:

There's a specific order of operations that recovery must run these
intents in, and so if we re-order them here in the CIL they'll be
out of order in the log and recovery will replay the intents in the
wrong order. Replaying the intents in the wrong order results in
corruption warnings and assert failures during log recovery, hence
the constraint of not re-ordering items within the same transaction.

Cheers,

Dave.
