As anything, it's always a trade-off.
The key thing to take away here is your patch make the whole code it touches
harder to understand without bringing any real benefit. Even if you could
prove this adds small performance gain to the fsmap interface, perhaps it
would still not be worth the performance gain in lieu of poor code reliability,
giving the interface you changed. So, it's always about discussing the
change's trade-off between complexity and performance. In your case, there
seems to be no real trade-off.
