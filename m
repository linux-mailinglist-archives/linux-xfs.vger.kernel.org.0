I don't think so. @attrip is the attribute information recovered
from the original intent - we allocated @attr in
xfs_attri_item_recover() to enable the operation indicated by
@attrip to be executed.  We copy stuff from @attrip (the item we are
recovering) to the new @attr structure (the work we need to do) and
run it through the attr modification state machine. If there's more
work to be done, we then add @attr to the defer list.

If there is deferred work to be continued, we still need a new
intent to indicate what attr operation needs to be performed next in
the chain.  When we commit the transaction (639), it will create a
new intent log item for the deferred attribute operation in the
->create_intent callback before the transaction is committed.

IOWs, we never re-use the incoming intent item that we are
recovering. The new log item will end up in the AIL at/beyond
last_lsn when the CIL is committed. It does not get further
processing work done until all the intents in the log that need
recovery have had their initial processing performed and the log
space they consume has been freed up.

Please understand that we do actually know how the ASSERT
infrastructure works and we utilise it to our advantage in many
ways.  We often use asserts to document design/code constraints and
use debug kernels to perform runtime design rule violation
detection.

Indeed, we really don't want design/code constraints being checked on
production kernels, largely because we know they are never going to
be tripped in normal production system operation. IOWs, these checks
are unnecessary in production systems because we've already done all
the constraint/correctness checking of the code on debug kernels
before we release the software to production.

If a particular situation is a production concern, we code it as an
error check, not an ASSERT. If it's a design or implementation
constraint check, it's an ASSERT. The last_lsn ASSERT is checking
that the code is behaving according to design constraints (i.e.
CIL/AIL ordering has not been screwed up, intent recovery has not
changed behaviour, and new objects always appear at >= last_lsn).
None of these things should ever occur in a production system - if
any of them occur do then we'll have much, much worse problems to
address than log recovery maybe running an intent too early.

-Dave.
