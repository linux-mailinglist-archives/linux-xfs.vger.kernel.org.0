It's based on for-next at this point.  Both these sets are pretty big, 
so it's a lot to chase if he's not interested in slowing down to work 
with the combination of them.  If folks would like to see the 
combination set before moving forward, I'd be happy to try and put that 
together.  Otherwise, it can wait too.  Let me know.  Thanks!
