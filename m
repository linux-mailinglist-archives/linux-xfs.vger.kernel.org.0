If it were up to me I'd invent a userspace shim fs that would perform
whatever normalizations are desired, and pass that (and ideally a lookup
hash) to the underlying kernel/fs.  Users can configure whatever
filtering they want and set LC_ALL as they please, and we kernel
developers never have to know, and the users never have to see what
actually gets written to disk.  If users want normalized ci lookups, the
shim can do that.

ext4 tried to do better than XFS by actually defining the mathematical
transformation that would be applied to incoming names and refusing
things that would devolve into brokenness, but then it turns out that it
was utf8_data.c.  Urgh.

I get it, shi* fses are not popular and are not fast, but if the Samba
benchmarks are still valid, multiple kernel<->fuserspace transitions are
still faster that their workaround.

Hah, nope, I'm all out of sanity here. :(
