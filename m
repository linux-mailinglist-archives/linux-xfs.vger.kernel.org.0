IMO, the last sentence should capture /why/ we subtract the blocks that
are in use by the free space btrees because we used to advertise freesp
btree blocks in f_bfree/f_bavail, and someone who is accustomed to that
behavior might read the sentence and think "Oh, that's incorrect".

But clearly "due to per-AG metadata reservations" isn't clear enough, so
I'll change it to:

"The blocks currently in use by the freespace btrees because they record
the actual blocks that will fill per-AG metadata space reservations."

Thanks for the review :)
