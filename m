From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

If the journal geometry results in a sector or log stripe unit
validation problem, it indicates that we cannot set the log up to
safely write to the the journal. In these cases, we must abort the
mount because the corruption needs external intervention to resolve.
Similarly, a journal that is too large cannot be written to safely,
either, so we shouldn't allow those geometries to mount, either.

If the log is too small, we risk having transaction reservations
overruning the available log space and the system hanging waiting
for space it can never provide. This is purely a runtime hang issue,
not a corruption issue as per the first cases listed above. We abort
mounts of the log is too small for V5 filesystems, but we must allow
v4 filesystems to mount because, historically, there was no log size
validity checking and so some systems may still be out there with
undersized logs.

The problem is that on V4 filesystems, when we discover a log
geometry problem, we skip all the remaining checks and then allow
the log to continue mounting. This mean that if one of the log size
checks fails, we skip the log stripe unit check. i.e. we allow the
mount because a "non-fatal" geometry is violated, and then fail to
check the hard fail geometries that should fail the mount.

Move all these fatal checks to the superblock verifier, and add a
new check for the two log sector size geometry variables having the
same values. This will prevent any attempt to mount a log that has
invalid or inconsistent geometries long before we attempt to mount
the log.

However, for the minimum log size checks, we can only do that once
we've setup up the log and calculated all the iclog sizes and
roundoffs. Hence this needs to remain in the log mount code after
the log has been initialised. It is also the only case where we
should allow a v4 filesystem to continue running, so leave that
handling in place, too.
