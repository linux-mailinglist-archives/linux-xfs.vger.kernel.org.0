Well, I would expect that allocation of an already allocated space won't account that space again so
it's a clear bug for me. But I'm not aware of XFS internals and understand that it can follow from
overall space allocation logic.

If our customer pays for a disk quota and cannot upload it's favorite 16 GiB movie to Samba share
although he sees more than 30 GiB of space free, it's a bit hard to explain him that this is an
expected and exceedingly rare behavior. :-)

I definitely agree that this is ... ehm, stupid way of file space reservation. I'll try to discuss
it on Samba mailing list too. Fortunately, turning off Samba's "string allocate" feature solves the
issue with minimal drawbacks.
