This patch would /also/ prevent us from writing an fstest to check that
a process /does/ get SIGBUS when writing to a mapping beyond EOF.  Huh,
we don't have a test for that...

Also, where does generic/173 write to a mapping beyond EOF?  It sets up
a file of blksz*nr_blks bytes, clones it, fills the fs to full, and then
writes that number of bytes to the mmap region to trigger SIGBUS when
the COW fails due to ENOSPC.
