Sooo I got a bug report that this essentially breaks the timer for
soft quota, because we now (and quite rapidly) hit the default
5-warning limit well before we hit any reasonable timer that may
have been set, and disallow more space usage.

And those warnings rack up in somewhat unexpected (to me, anyway)
ways. With a default max warning count of 5, I go over soft quota
exactly once, touch/create 2 more empty inodes, and I'm done:

# rm -f /mnt/xfs/*
# xfs_quota -x -c 'report -h' /mnt/xfs
User quota on /mnt/xfs (/dev/loop1)

# sudo -u quota_test touch /mnt/xfs/c
touch: cannot touch ‘/mnt/xfs/c’: Disk quota exceeded

And the xfs_quota manpage doesn't even say that this is supposed
to be a transition to a hard limit, although the code does seem
to think so ...

"Allows the quota warnings limit (i.e. the number of times a warning
will be send to someone over quota) to be viewed and modified."

There are other oddities too, like a (default) 0 day timer means
"no timer" but a 0 warning count means "you get no warnings.
you're done when you hit the soft quota."

And the xfs_quota interface for setting the warnings is unexpectedly
different from the interface for timers, as well.

So ... thoughts? 

TBH I'd almost suggest reverting the increment until this is sorted,
but I presume you changed this for a reason. :) (And it's been there
a pretty long time, now.)

Thanks,
