That's fine for the bio, which has a direct pointer to the request
queue. Here the allocation may be a long way away from the IO
itself, and we migh actually be slicing and dicing an allocated
region into a bio and not just the whole region itself.

So I've just taken the worst case - queue_dma_alignment() returns
511 if no queue is supplied, so this is the worst case alignment
that the block device will require. We don't need any more to fix
the problem right now, and getting alignment into this function in
all cases makes it a bit more complicated...

No, at worst we should in the alignment - there is no good reason to
be passing buftargs, block devices or request queues into memory
allocation APIs. I'll have a look at this.

That's no good because memory debugging can be turned on without
CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG (how we tripped over the xenblk case).

if vmalloc is returning unaligned regions, lots of stuff is going to
break everywhere. It has to be page aligned because of the pte
mappings it requires. Memory debugging puts guard pages around
vmalloc, it doesn't change the alignment.

Cheers,

Dave.
