All right, I've found the revert partial patch in for-next:
83a21c18441f xfs: Directory's data fork extent counter can never overflow

I can backport this patch to stable after it hits mainline (since this is not
an urgent fix I would wait for v.5.19.0) with the obvious omission of the
XFS_MAX_EXTCNT_*_FORK_LARGE constants.

But even then, unless we have a clear revert in mainline, it is better to
have the history in stable as it was in mainline.

Furthermore, stable, even more than mainline, should always prefer safety
over performance optimization, the sending the 3 patches already in mainline
to stable without the partial revert is better than sending no patches at all
and better then delaying the process.

Thanks,
Amir.
