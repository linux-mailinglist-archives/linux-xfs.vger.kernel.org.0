Having a checklist is a good idea. :)

Yeah, I tend to push back on black and white process requirements
like this.  Everything has shades of grey. The process of responding
to so many small, trivial changes broken up like this is not an
efficient or effective use of developer time.

One function per patch makes sense when there are lots of changes to
a single function. But for stuff where there is only one or two
users (e.g. platform_discard, platform_findrawpath, platform*_block*
etc) splitting them in to single patches is not efficient.

I always think of it like this: would I like to have to reply to 29
emails just to add RVBs for such a change? Responding to 29 emails
is a decent chunk of time that every reviewer must invest. Is the
change complex enough to need such fine grained review effort.

In this case, I think no, especially because it hid where a
significant issue was introduced....

Ok, this is something that should definitely be mentioned in the
commit message because it's not just a rename.

As it is, this is the sort of problem we have to solve in userspace.
That was the purpose of the #define uuid_copy() you removed - it
translates the kernel API to the userspace API. We still need
something like that, which means the platform_uuid_copy()
change-over likely needs it's own patch and documentation (because
it's not just a straight rename anymore.

We do not want to make libxfs code unnecessarily different between
user and kernel space because that increases the overhead of porting
changes between kernel <-> userspace code bases. Hence we really
need to solve the "same function name, different calling convention"
in some way in userspace without requiring code diffs between kernel
and userspace.

Maybe some pre-processor magic can be done here in userspace. Maybe
we need to rename uuid_copy() in both the kernel and userspace, so
both have a static inline wrapper that can call the native
uuid_copy() with the correct parameters (another reason for it being
a separate patch so it can be easily ported).

Cheers,

Dave.
