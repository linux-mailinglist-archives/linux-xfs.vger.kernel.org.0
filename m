IIRC, I chose #2 way back when I was consolidating all the libxfs
library code. There was code that declared libxfs_init_t x; on
stack, as local globals, in the libraries, etc. So I simply made the
library global the One True Global, and then had everyone use it
everywhere.

That was just the simplest solution at the time to minimise the
amount of work to get userspace up to date with the kernel to allow
integration of the CRC work (userspace was years out of date at that
point). It was not pretty (like a lot of my code), but it worked.

Feel free to do what you think is best :)

Cheers,

Dave.
