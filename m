I'm not sure that we have any focused mount option testing in fstests.
It looks like we have various remount tests and such to cover corner
cases and/or specific bugs, but nothing to make sure various options
continue to work or otherwise fail gracefully. Do you have any plans to
add such a test to help verify this work?
