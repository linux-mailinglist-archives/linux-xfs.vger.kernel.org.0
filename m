I'd say drop it from this series and resend it with that series if
you are going to send it out.

It only started to care about them because you merged the functions
and now exposed them to the dqrele code at the beginning of this series.
But with just a single user not caring and too aring I'm perfectly fine
with exposing the tags in the interface.

Maybe just flip the default for the flag if that makes your series
easier?
