Ok, so according to that commit log the original purpose of this code
was to work around a quirky mkfs condition where record length of an
unmount record was enlarged but the iclog buffer size remained at 32k.
The fix is to simply increase the size of iclog buf.

Is this something you've observed or attempted to reproduce, or is this
based on code inspection?

Why is the second part of the check removed?

I'm a little confused why we take hsize as a parameter as well as read
it from the record header. If we're validating a particular record,
shouldn't we use the size as specified by that record?

Also FWIW I think pulling bits of logic out of the XFS_IS_CORRUPT()
check makes this a little harder to read than just putting the entire
logic statement within the macro.

I think we've made a point to avoid the [un]likely() modifiers in XFS as
they don't usually have a noticeable impact. I certainly wouldn't expect
it to in log recovery.

I also find updating the header structure as such down in a "validation
helper" a bit obscured.

In these two cases we've already allocated the record header and data
buffers and we're walking through the log records doing recovery. Given
that, it seems like the purpose of the parameter is more to check the
subsequent records against the size of the current record buffer. That
seems like a reasonable check to incorporate, but I think the mkfs
workaround logic is misplaced in a generic record validation helper.
IIUC that is a very special case that should only apply to the first
record in the log and only impacts the size of the buffer we allocate to
read in the remaining records.

Can we rework this to leave the mkfs workaround logic as is and update
the validation helper to check that each record length fits in the size
of the buffer we've decided to allocate? I'd also suggest to rename the
new parameter to something like 'bufsize' instead of 'h_size' to clarify
what it actually means in the context of xlog_valid_rec_header().
