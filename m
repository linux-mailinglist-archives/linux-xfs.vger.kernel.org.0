I do have a script that reproduces the problem.  At the moment it is in
a pretty embarrasing state.  I'm happy to clean it up a bit and share
it, or try to turn it into a fstest, or both.  The script currently
creates small loop devices to generate a filesystem layout that's a
little easier to work with.  Is it considered acceptable to have a
fstest create a filesystem with a particular geometry?  (And would you
consider taking a patch to let mkfs.xfs --unsupported take both size and
agsize arguments so the overall filesystem size and the per-ag size
could be set by a test?)

The other thing that I really appreciated here is that the patchset
cleaned up a bunch of the different allocation functions and made
everything easier to read and follow.  Thanks for that as well.

I don't have a good answer for this yet.  The team is planning to start
migrating later in the year and this will probably run through to next
year.  I'll have that information eventually and will share it when I
do, but don't know yet.  Aside from the script, other synethtic
load-tests have not been successful in reproducing the problemr.  That
may be the result of the databases that are spun up for load testing not
having filesystems that as full and fragmented as the production ones.

Thanks, Dave.  I appreciate you spending the time to review and provide
feedback.
