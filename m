Sure, I will re-send the patchset with a cover letter.

My patchset fixes bugs in the calculation of log space reservation for "xattr
set" operation. I read the code at
"https://github.com/allisonhenderson/xfs_work.git delay_ready_attrs_v7" and
found that the bugs still exist in that code as well. So IMHO, the two
patchsets do not mutually exclude each other.
