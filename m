hmmmm.

xfs_force_shutdown() will does nothing if the iclog at the head of
the log->iclog list is marked with XLOG_STATE_IOERROR before IO is
submitted. In general, that is the case here as the head iclog is
what xlog_state_get_iclog_space() returns.

i.e. XLOG_STATE_IOERROR here implies the log has already been shut
down because the state is IOERROR rather than ACTIVE or WANT_SYNC as
was set when the iclog was obtained from
xlog_state_get_iclog_space().

Hence I suspect that this should be ASSERT(XLOG_FORCED_SHUTDOWN(log))
just like is in xfs_log_force_umount() when this pre-existing log
IO error condition is tripped over...

Cheers,

Dave.
