Heh. "You understood the patch, so it must be better!" :P

I've paged much of this out in the 2 months or so since this review was
posted, but my recollection is quite different. I use the existing code
as a baseline to confirm behavior and assess readability of the updated
code.

Well, this review has been on the list for more than a couple months
now. Given the response seems to have appeared after the next version of
the series, I'm not sure it's worth digging my head back into the
details to try and make a more detailed argument. Suffice it to say that
I recall what I proposed as intended to be a fairly reasonable
incremental step from what you ended up at to replace the large amount
of resulting duplication with a single implementation that otherwise
preserves the majority of the other cleanups. Not a rewrite or anything
of the sort..

In any event, no single one of us is ultimately the authority on
"better" or "simple." I'm just providing feedback that I didn't find the
resulting factoring as a clear improvement, find it a bit annoying to
have to dig through duplicate implementations to locate the subtle and
unnecessary differences, and provided a suggestion on how to address
that concern (that doesn't involve rewriting the thing) with specific
details on how and why I think it improves readability. *shrug* Perhaps
others will look at this, disagree with that assessment and find the
separate functions more straightforward.

That context and how that relates the proposed structure is not clear to
me. That said, I _thought_ I looked through far enough into this series
to grok how intertwined the resulting structure might have been with
subsequent patches in order to provide thoughtful feedback, but I could
be mistaken.

Not every incremental development step is necessarily a suitable point
for an upstream release. My comment above is basically to say that I
think this refactoring is nearly to that point, but should go a bit
further to reduce the duplication. If the argument against that step is
dependence on future work, then propose the factoring close enough to
that work such that sufficient context is available to review.
