Ah, right, I overlooked that the long running truncates only regrant a
single reservation unit at a time when they roll, and the runtime
instances I seen of this are with long running truncate operations
(i.e. inactivation after unlink for multi-thousand extent inodes).

So, yes, all types of intent recovery must only use a single unit
reservation, not just EFIs, because there is no guarantee that there
is a full unit * count reservation available in the journal whenever
that intent was first logged. Indeed, at best it will be 'count - 1'
that is avaialble, becuase the transaction that logged the intent
will have used a full unit of the original reservation....

OK, yes, it does seem there are two problems here...

Well, it's not the careful check that is the problem; the race is
much simpler than that. We just have to have two concurrent
reservations that will both fit in the remaining log space
individually but not together. i.e. this is the overcommit race
window:

P1				P2
---------------------------	--------------------------
xfs_log_reserve(10000 bytes)
  xlog_grant_head_check()
    xlog_space_left()
      <sees 12000 bytes>
    OK, doesn't wait
  				xfs_log_reserve(10000 bytes)
				  xlog_grant_head_check()
				    xlog_space_left()
				      <sees 12000 bytes>
				    OK, doesn't wait
    xlog_grant_add_space(10k)
    				  xlog_grant_add_space(10k)

And now we've overcommitted the log by 8000 bytes....

The current byte based grant head patch set does not address this;
the attempt I made to fix it didn't work properly, so I split the
rework of the throttling out of the byte based accounting patchset
(which seems to work correctly without reworking
xlog_grant_head_check()) and now I'm trying to address this race
condition as a separate patchset...

-Dave.
