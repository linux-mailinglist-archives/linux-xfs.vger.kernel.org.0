So one of the things that I've been kind of unclear on about the current
deferred inactivation implementation is the primary goal of the percpu
optimization. I obviously can see the value of the percpu list in
general, but how much processing needs to occur in percpu context to
achieve the primary goal?

For example, I can see how a single or small multi threaded sustained
file removal might be batched efficiently, but what happens if said task
happens to bounce around many cpus? What if a system has hundreds of
cpus and enough removal tasks to populate most or all of the queues? Is
it worth having 200 percpu workqueue tasks doing block truncations and
inode frees to a filesystem that might have something like 16-32 AGs?

So I dunno, ISTM that the current implementation can be hyper efficient
for some workloads and perhaps unpredictable for others. As Dave already
alluded to, the tradeoff often times for such hyper efficient structures
is functional inflexibility, which is kind of what we're seeing between
the inability to recycle inodes wrt to this topic as well as potential
optimizations on the whole RCU recycling thing. The only real approach
that comes to mind for managing this kind of infrastructure short of
changing data structures is to preserve the ability to drain and quiesce
it regardless of filesystem state.

For example, I wonder if we could do something like have the percpu
queues amortize insertion into lock protected perag lists that can be
managed/processed accordingly rather than complete the entire
inactivation sequence in percpu context. From there, the perag lists
could be processed by an unbound/multithreaded workqueue that's maybe
more aligned with the AG count on the filesystem than cpu count on the
system.

I suspect something like that would allow for a more ideal combination
of performance and flexibility because then the percpu component never
has to freeze at all, it can just continue to drain into the perag lists
based on specified heuristic. Processing of the aggregated lists would
have to stop on freeze of course, but from there we'd at least have a
lock protected data structure to allow things like lookup to pull inodes
off for recycling purposes, online repair (?), etc., or for the
inactivation workqueue to skip inodes that might still be waiting on a
grace period to expire before they should be freed and made reallocation
candidates (including intelligence on when to most efficiently wait on a
grace period). (And maybe in the future this could tie in with your
earlier thought about making inactivation more granular in terms of
separating inode truncation from block and inode freeing so more work
can be done per AG lock cycle, etc.).

Of course, this would most likely have to come at some performance cost
as compared to the current, lockless implementation. The question to me
is more what is the cost in order to achieve the desired flexibility?
I.e., if we could preserve 80% of the performance benefit of the current
implementation with additional flexibility of lifting some of the work
out of the percpu tasks, would that be worth it? I'm not really sure
what all of the tradeoffs are here because of my questions above around
the goals of the implementation, etc. I'm sure I'm missing other context
as well, so that is mostly just my current handwavy thinking about how
to possibly accomplish some of these functional goals without having to
completely change out the existing data structure...
