I think we should be more concerned about this everywhere.  Remember
that guy who fuzzed a btree so that the lower levels pointed "down" to
an upper level btree block?  Detection and recovery from that is what
running with xfs_trans_alloc_empty() buys us.  It's not a general cycle
detector as you point out below...

...because we don't detect loops within a particular level of a btree.
In theory this is possible if you are willing to enhance (for example)
a XFS_BB_RIGHTSIB move by comparing the rightmost record in the old
block against the leftmost record in the new block, but right now the
codebase (except for scrub) doesn't do that.

Maybe someone'll do that some day; it would close a pretty big hole in
runtime problem detection.

We /do/ hold empty transactions when calling xfs_metadir_load so that we
can error out on wrong-level types of dabtree cycles instead of hanging
the kernel.

I feel it prudent to check for inconsistencies between the inobt state
and the inode records themselves, because bad space metadata can cause
disproportionately more problems in a filesystem than a regular file's
metadata.  Unlike regular files that can be unloaded and reloaded at
will, we only do this once, so the overhead of the inobt walk is
amortized over the entire mount-lifetime of the filesystem because we
don't irele metadata inodes.

IOWs it's not strictly necessary, but the cost is low to have this
additional safety.

But you're right, that should've been in the comment for this function.
