Older kernels (pre-5.4 I think?) permitted userspace to store arbitrary
64-bit timestamps in the in-memory inode.  The fs would truncate (== rip
off the upper bits) them when writing them to disk, and then you'd get
the shattered remnants the next time the inode got reloaded from disk.

Nowadays, filesystems advertise the timestamp range they support, and
the VFS clamps the in-memory timestamp to that range.
