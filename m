As we already discussed on IRC, please send new revisions of patchsets
as a separate thread from the old submission.

Hm, this cover letter could use some tidying up, since it took me a bit
of digging to figure out that yes, this is the successor of the old
series that tried to get the AGI buffer lock out of the way if we're
adding a newly unlinked inode to the end of the unlinked list.

Oh?  These seem like serious limitations, are they still true?
