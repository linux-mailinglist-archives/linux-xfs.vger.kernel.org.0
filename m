I'm not quite following (probably just because I'm not terribly familiar
with the use case). If current kernels know how to fake up whiteout
inodes in memory based on a dentry, why do we need to continue to create
new on-disk whiteout inodes just because a filesystem might already have
such inodes on disk? Wouldn't the old format whiteouts just continue to
work as expected without any extra handling?

I can see needing a feature bit to restrict a filesystem from being used
on an unsupported, older kernel, but is there a reason we wouldn't just
enable that by default anyways?
