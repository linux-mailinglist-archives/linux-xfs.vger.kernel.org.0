Hm.  To summarize (poorly) a conversation we had on IRC, I guess the
problem here is that xfs_rename logs both an attr-set and an attr-remove
log item to a rename transaction.  Then log recovery finds both, starts
the first step of the attr-set, and we capture-and-commit the rest of
the chain.  Next it recovers the the attr-remove, starts the first step
of /that/ (which clobbers the attr fork) and capture-and-commits that.
Finally, we continue the attr-set, which promptly barfs because the attr
fork disappeared on it!

So I guess this is a gaping hole in how log recovery works because we
don't write enough information into the log intent items to be able to
reconstruct the full defer ops chains that were attached to a
transaction.  If we could do that, then we'd know that there exists a
data dependency between the set and the remove such that we must finish
the entire set chain before moving on to the remove chain.

However, we don't know this.  Thus far in the lifespan of defer ops, I
think we've been careful/lucky enough that we've never had this problem,
and reworking the log format to encode transaction chain details is
quite a lot of work.

A second thought -- the xattri log recovery routine recreates the defer
ops state, logs an xattrd for the recovered item, takes one step in the
state machine, and uses capture-and-commit to defer any more steps to a
later time.  What if instead the recovery routine didn't take that extra
step?  If all it did was recreate the incore defer ops state and
deferred everything else to xlog_finish_defer_ops, the attr set and attr
remove recoveries would not overlap and trip over each other.

Maybe a POC would be to have the _recover function log the xattrd for
the recovered log item and call xfs_defer_ops_capture_and_commit without
actually bothering with xfs_attri_finish_update?  Something like this?

	xfs_init_attr_trans(args, &tres, &total);
	error = xfs_trans_alloc(mp, &tres, total, 0, XFS_TRANS_RESERVE,
			&tp);
	if (error)
		goto out;

	args->trans = tp;
	done_item = xfs_trans_get_attrd(tp, attrip);

	xfs_ilock(ip, XFS_ILOCK_EXCL);
	xfs_trans_ijoin(tp, ip, 0);

	xfs_defer_add(tp, XFS_DEFER_OPS_TYPE_ATTR, &attr->xattri_list);
	error = xfs_defer_ops_capture_and_commit(tp, capture_list);
	if (error)
		goto out_unlock;

	xfs_iunlock(ip, XFS_ILOCK_EXCL);
	xfs_irele(ip);
	return 0;

A third thought I had for solving this problem would be to extend the
xattr log format to be able to record a "rename and rewrite" operation.
I only suggest this because directory online repair currently works by
creating a temporary file, using the regular xfs_dir_createname function
to build the directory structures (without touching the children) and
then uses swapext to exchange the directory structure blocks.  When
parent pointers come along, I guess we'll have to figure out how to
insert dirents at specific offsets, or we'll have to figure out how to
update all the parent pointers atomically.  Yuck.

While a "rename and reset" xattr op would work here, I suppose the
online repair case is a lot simpler -- it never needs to update the
dirent name, so all we really have to do is rewrite the xattr key,
remove the dabtree hash mapping, and insert a new one.

Hmm ok I'm going to go eat dinner and think about my second suggestion
tomorrow.
