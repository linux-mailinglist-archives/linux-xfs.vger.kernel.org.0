This whole thing is as twisty as a pretzel driving into the mountains.

The end game is that b_bn is actually the cache key for the xfs_buf
structure, so ultimately we don't want anyone accessing it other than
the cache management functions.  Hence we spend the next two patches
kicking everybody off of b_bn and then rename it to b_cache_key.  Anyone
who wants the daddr address of an xfs_buf (cached or uncached) is
supposed to use bp->b_maps[0].bm_bn (or xfs_buf_daddr/xfs_buf_set_daddr)
after that point.

xfs_get_aghdr_buf (in xfs_ag.c) encodes that rather than setting up a
one-liner helper because that's the only place in the kernel where we
call xfs_buf_get_uncached.  By contrast, userspace needs to set a
buffer's daddr(ess) from mkfs and libxlog, so (I guess) that's why the
helper is still useful.

*However* at this point in the game, most people still use b_bn
(incorrectly) so that's probably why alloc_write_buf sets both.

I guess this patch should have replaced only the "b_bn = daddr" part,
and in the next patch removed the "bp->b_maps[0].bm_bn = daddr" line.

After all that, b_bn of the uncached buffer will be NULLDADDR, like it's
supposed to be.
