What's the purpose of forcing xfs_repair to be run on every boot?
The whole point of having a journalling filesystem is to avoid
needing to run fsck on every boot.

I get why one might want to occasionally force a repair check on
boot (e.g. to repair a problem with the root filesystem), but this
is a -rescue operation- and really shouldn't be occurring
automatically on every boot or after a kernel crash.

If it is only occurring during rescue operations, then why is it a problem
dumping out to a shell for the admin performing rescue
operations to deal with this directly? e.g. if the fs has a
corrupted journal, then a mount cycle will not fix the problem and
the admin will still get dumped into a rescue shell to fix the
problem manually.

Hence I don't really know why anyone would be configuring their
systems like this:

> Run xfs_repair -e when fsck.mode=force and repair=auto or yes.

as it makes no sense at all for a journalling filesystem.

> If fsck.mode=force and fsck.repair=no, run xfs_repair -n without
> replaying the logs.

Nor is it clear why anyone would want force a boot time fsck and
then not repair the damage that might be found....

More explanation, please!

As a side note, the patch has damaged whitespace....
