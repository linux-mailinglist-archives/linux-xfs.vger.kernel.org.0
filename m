IIRC, it's the per-ag histograms that are more important here
because we are running out of space in an AG because of
overcommitting the per-ag space. If there is an AG that is much more
fragmented than others, then it will be consuming much more in way
of freespace btree blocks than others...

FWIW, if you are using reflink heavily and you have rmap enabled (as
you have), there's every chance that an AG has completely run out of
space and so new rmap records for shared extents can't be allocated
- that can give you spurious ENOSPC errors before the filesystem is
100% full, too.

i.e. every shared extent in the filesystem has a rmap record
pointing back to each owner of the shared extent. That means for an
extent shared 1000 times, there are 1000 rmap records for that
shared extent. If you share it again, a new rmap record needs to be
inserted into the rmapbt, and if the AG is completely out of space
this can fail w/ ENOSPC. Hence you can get ENOSPC errors attempting
to shared or unshare extents because there isn't space in the AG for
the tracking metadata for the new extent record....

So 5.7M freespace records. Assume perfect packing an thats roughly
500 records to a btree block so at least 10,000 freespace btree
blocks in the filesytem. But we really need to see the per-ag
histograms to be able to make any meaningful analysis of the free
space layout in the filesystem....

Average size by itself isn't actually useful for analysis. The
histogram is what gives us all the necessary information. e.g. this
could be a thousand single block extents and one 65000 block extent
or it could be a million 64k extents. The former is pretty good, the
latter is awful (indicates likely worst case 64kB extent
fragmentation behaviour), because ....

... the kb article completely glosses over the fact that we really
have to consider the histogram those averages are dervied from
before making a judgement on the state of the AG. It equates
"average extent size" with "fragmented AG", when in reality there's
a whole lot more to consider such as number of free extents, the
size of the AG, the amount of free space being indexed, the nature
of the workload and the allocations it requires, etc.

e.g. I'd consider the "AG greatly fragmented" case given in that KB
article to be perfectly fine if the workload is random 4KB writes
and hole punching to manage space in sparse files (perhaps, say,
lots of raw VM image files and guests have -o discard enabled). In
those cases, there's a huge number of viable allocation candidates
in the free space that can be found quickly and efficiently as
there's no possibility of large contiguous extents being formed for
user data because the IO patterns are small random writes into
sparse files...

Context is very important when trying to determine if free space
fragmentation is an issue or not. Most of the time, it isn't an
issue at all but people have generally been trained to think "all
fragmentation is bad" rather than "only worry about fragmentation if
there is a problem that is directly related to physical allocation
patterns"...

Cheers,

Dave.
