Because we calculate it when we build the lv chain in a push and
only use the value the checkpoint transaction header. This is now
entirely encapsulated within the CIL push code and is no longer
something the xlog_write() needs to know because it doesn't build on
disk transaction headers. If we need debug to track how long the
lvchain is, then grab it the CIL code where it is already known...

Cheers,

Dave.
