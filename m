Yes.  I think bio_for_each_segment is buggy here, as it should not
blindly split by pages.  CcingMing as he wrote much of this code.  I'll
also dig into fixing it, but I just arrived in Japan and might be a
little jetlagged.

The xen block driver doesn't use bio_for_each_segment, so it isn't
exactly the same but a very related issue.  Maybe until we sort
all this mess out we just need to depend on !SLUB_DEBUG for XFS?
