It's a little hard to follow this with the nr_blocks sampling and
whatnot, but I think I get the idea. What's the reason for splitting the
AGFL res requirement evenly across the two cursors? These AGFL blocks
all fall into the same overflow pool, right? I was wondering why we
couldn't just attach the overflow to one, or check one for the full res
and then the other if more blocks are needed.

In thinking about it a bit more, wouldn't the whole algorithm be more
simple if we reserved the min AGFL requirement first, optionally passed
'agfl_res' to reserve_btblocks() such that subsequent reservations can
steal from it (and then fail if it depletes), then stuff what's left in
one (or both, if there's a reason for that) of the cursors at the end?
