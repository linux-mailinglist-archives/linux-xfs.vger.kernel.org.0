When I added an fstests config for "RAID" striping (aka MKFS_OPTIONS='-d
su=128k,sw=4'), I suddenly started seeing this test fail sporadically
with:

 writing modified primary superblock
 sb root inode INO inconsistent with calculated value INO

Eventually I tracked this down to a mis-interaction between the test,
xfs_repair, and the storage device.

The storage advertises SCSI UNMAP support, but it is of the variety
where the UNMAP command returns immediately but takes its time to unmap
in the background.  Subsequent rereads are allowed to return stale
contents, per DISCARD semantics.

When the fstests cloud is not busy, the old contents disappear in a few
seconds.  However, at peak utilization, there are ~75 VMs running, and
the storage backend can take several minutes to commit these background
requests.

When we zero the primary super and start xfs_repair on SCRATCH_DEV, it
will walk the device looking for secondary supers.  Most of the time it
finds the actual AG 1 secondary super, but sometimes it finds ghosts
from previous formats.  When that happens, xfs_repair will talk quite a
bit about those failed secondaries, even if it eventually finds an
acceptable secondary sb and completes the repair.

Filter out the messages about secondary supers.
