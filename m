Hi Darrick!

Thanks for making this introduction.

I've added Tyler (Microsoft) for his interest in 5.10 LTS backports
and Luis (Samsung) who has worked with the stable maintainers on xfs
backports in the past and is collaborating with me on 5.10 LTS testing
these days.

Correct, my goals are twofold:

1. Consolidate duplicate efforts on stable kernel -
For CTERA products that are shippened as a VM image, I do not *need*
my backports to CTERA kernel to go to LTS. I *want* them to go to LTS.
As a community of developers who work for different companies,
we work so well together on upstream and so poorly apart on the
stable kernels that we each maintain.
I would like to see that change.

2. For CTERA products that run in containers in the cloud, we rely on the flow
of fixes to LTS kernels that will someday flow into the container host OS
of the cloud provider. Unless I start sending patches to cloud
providers directly,
LTS is my only path to get things fixed in the future.
For this use case, we do not even have the luxury of assuming a recent LTS
kernel. The major cloud providers released host OS images based on 5.10
only late 2021.

I am very happy that you stepped up to write these expectations.
Please spell out the process you want to see, because it was not
clear to Ted and to me how we should post the xfs stable candidates.

Should we post to xfs list and wait for explicit ACK/RVB on every patch?
Should we post to xfs list and if no objections are raised post to stable?
For those of you not subscribed to xfs list, I have just sent my first crop
of 5.10 candidates yesterday [1]. Still waiting to see how that plays out.

The question is, to soak in 'master' or to soak in a release?
which means to soak in the stable kernel.

My opinion is that if we want exposure to real users that use diverse
userspace tools, then soaking in stable is the right answer, so typically
(b) patches would be soaking ~2 months in -rc and then ~2 more months
in .y and at that point they can ONLY be considered for LTS, because that
.y release (which is not LTS) is EOL.

Here is one thought - the stable candidate review process is bound to add
more work to the overloaded xfs maintainer.

I think it is a classic role to delegate to xfs stable tree maintainer(s).
The xfs stable maintainer(s) job would be to ping reviewers for acks
make sure patches are tested according to the standard and then
curate a tree and communicate with the stable maintainers.

Ideally, there will be a maintainer per LTS tree, which could naturally
align with the interest of employers and easier for developers to justify
spent time, but the load can be shared among maintainers, as nagging
for review is often not LTS specific.

If xfs maintainers are willing to put their trust in me, I volunteer for the
job of xfs stable patch hurding in general and/or 5.10 LTS specific,
which I am also contributing to.

Thanks,
Amir.
