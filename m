Yes, you are right. When I tried to fix the perag leak issue in patch 3,
I found this problem.

Yes, agree with you, I used to think that removing the assertion
would solve the problem, but now it seems a bit lazy, the problem
should be solved at the source. Right now, I haven't figured out
how to fix this problem comprehensively, so I'll fix perag leak
issue first.
