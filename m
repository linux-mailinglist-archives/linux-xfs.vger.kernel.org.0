I didn't observe that before, but if that's the case and I understand
correctly, I think the first deleted directory could be cleared in
advance (or at least the dotdot entry) since the dotdot ino is no
longer valid when flushing (and IMO it's actually a deaddir? and I
checked ext4, it seems reset its i_size = 0 for deaddirs.) Hopefully
I understand this correctly.

(and now busy in other random stuffs...)
