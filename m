Well, with out the set, you cannot use for example name->type anymore, 
you need to use args->name->type.  In order to use the local name 
variable again, it needs to be updated.  I stumbled across this myself 
when working with it and thought it would be better to fix it right away 
rather than let others run across the same mistake.  It seems like a 
subtle and easy thing to overlook otherwise.

I do think it's a bit of a wart that people may not have thought about 
when we talked about adding this patch.  Though I don't know that it's a 
big enough deal to drop it either.  But I did feel some motivation to at 
least clean it up and make a comment about it.
