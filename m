I have a very important information for you and your family that will definitely interest you but firstly,I want to ensure that you are the one getting this message directly before i release the information to you. I want you to confirm that your email address is still valid and accessed by you. As soon as i receive your response, I will proceed and give you the information. I am taking this preventive measure to avoid getting this important information into the wrong hands because of how sensitive it is. Thanks David
