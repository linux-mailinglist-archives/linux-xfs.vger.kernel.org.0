The changes in the patch "[PATCH V13 05/16] xfs: Check for extent overflow
when removing dir entries" are not correct. I noticed this only after sending
the patchset. The correct change should be,

       error = xfs_iext_count_may_overflow(ip, whichfork, 1);
       if (error) {
               ASSERT(S_ISDIR(VFS_I(ip)->i_mode) &&
                       whichfork == XFS_DATA_FORK);
               error = -ENOSPC;
               goto done;
       }

Hence please ignore this patchset. I will send the fixed version soon. Sorry
about the noise.
