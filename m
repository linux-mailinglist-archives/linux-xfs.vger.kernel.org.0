This seems fine.  While astute bashophiles will have no problem with this,
at some point it might be nice to add some comments above DB_OPTS and
REPAIR_OPTS that point out hey, if you set these, you WILL be invoking the
tool.

I also chafe a little at accumulating some device options in REPAIR_DEV_OPTS
and others in LOG_OPTS; why not REPAIR_DEV_OPTS and DB_DEV_OPTS for some
consistency?

But, this does seem to solve the problem, and in the
Spirit of Lets Not Navel-Gaze And Just Keep Fixing Things(tm),
