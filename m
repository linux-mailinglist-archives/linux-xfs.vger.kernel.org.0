Great, thanks for the info.

Ack, that makes sense to me. We use call_rcu() to free inode memory and
obviously will have a sync in the lookup path after this patch, but that
is a consequence of the polling we add at the same time. I'm not sure
that's enough activity on our own so I'd probably prefer to keep things
simple, use the start_poll_*() variant from the start, and then consider
further start/get filtering like you describe above if it ever becomes a
problem.

Hmm.. so I think this would be helpful if we were to stamp the inode
conditionally (i.e. unlinked inodes only) on eviction because then we
wouldn't have to worry about clearing the cookie if said inode happens
to be reallocated and then run through one or more eviction -> recycle
sequences after a rollover of the grace period counter. With that sort
of scheme, the inode could be sitting in cache for who knows how long
with a counter that was conditionally synced against many days (or
weeks?) prior, from whenever it was initially reallocated.

However, as Dave points out that we probably want to poll RCU state on
every inode eviction, I suspect that means this is less of an issue. An
inode must be evicted for it to become a recycle candidate, and so if we
update the inode unconditionally on every eviction, then I think the
recycle code should always see the most recent cookie value and we don't
have to worry much about clearing it.

I think it's technically possible for an inode to sit in an inactivation
queue for that sort of time period, but that would probably require the
filesystem go idle or drop to low enough activity that a spurious rcu
sync here or there is probably not a big deal. So all in all, I suspect
if we already had such a special cookie variant of the API that was
otherwise functionally equivalent, I'd probably use it to cover that
potential case, but it's not clear to me atm that this use case
necessarily warrants introduction of such an API...
