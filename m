Something along the lines of

	/*
	 * Submit IO more frequently and reduce the time log items spend
	 * in flushing state by breaking out of the item push loop once
	 * we've gathered enough IO to batch submission effectively.
	 */
	if (lip->li_lsn != lsn && count > 1000)
		break;

Maybe?

I think you told me you had some PTO coming up the month after LSF so I
did not choose to bother you during your time off with something that
didn't seem all /that/ urgent.  At worst, we merge it, try to tweak it,
and either make it better or revert it.
