The only improvement I can think of would be to force-disable large
folios on the file being tested.  Large folios mess with testing because
the race depends on write and writeback needing to walk multiple pages.
Right now the pagecache only institutes large folios if the IO patterns
are large IOs, but in theory that could change some day.

I suspect that the iomap tracepoint data and possibly
trace_mm_filemap_add_to_page_cache might help figure out what size
folios are actually in use during the invalidation test.

(Perhaps it's time for me to add a 64k bs VM to the test fleet.)
