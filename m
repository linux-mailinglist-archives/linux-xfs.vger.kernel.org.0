I miswrote. I meant fixes for bugs that existed since day 1.
The annotation above is adequate, but is also a bit ugly IMO.

I am sure that we can be more expressive than that :)

I suggested:
  Fixes: ????

Not as a joke. It is more descriptive than the above which could really
mean "I know this bug existed since day 1"

The funny thing is that my rant was about a cover letter written
by an upstream developer, so unless what you mean is that backport
teams should invest in review and make those comments during
review, then it's too late by the time the backport team got to do their job.

You raise the resources problem and I understand that, but
I am not looking for a solution that creates more work for upstream
maintainers. Quite the contrary.

I am simply looking for a standard way to express
"attention backport teams".

What I am looking for is a solution for this problem:

Developer/maintainer has information that can be very helpful to backport
teams.

The information is known at the time of the writing and it requires no extra
effort on their part, but is not mentioned in a standard way because there
is no standard way that does not incur extra work.

Some maintainers that I am working with are very diligent about requiring Fixes:
when applicable.

It may be because of $$$ as you say, but I have a more romantic interpretation.
I believe it is because they care about the code they are developing and they
understand that mainstream is not a product and has no real user.

Unless maintainers care about downstream products, real users will perceive
their code as bad quality - no matter whose responsibility it was to
backport the
fixes or point out to the relevant fixes.

Thanks,
Amir.
