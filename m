This smells of premature optimisation.

When we are in a tail-pushing scenario (i.e. any sort of
sustained metadata workload) this will always return true, and so we
will relog every intent that isn't in the current checkpoint every
time this is called.  Under light load, we don't care if we add a
little bit of relogging overhead as the CIL slowly flushes/pushes -
it will have neglible impact on performance because there is little
load on the journal.

However, when we are under heavy load the code will now be reading
the grant head and log position accounting variables during every
commit, hence greatly increasing the number and temporal
distribution of accesses to the hotest cachelines in the log. We
currently never access these cache lines during commit unless the
unit reservation has run out and we have to regrant physical log
space for the transaction to continue (i.e. we are into slow path
commit code). IOWs, this is like causing far more than double the
number of accesses to the grant head, the log tail, the
last_sync_lsn, etc, all of which is unnecessary exactly when we care
about minimising contention on the log space accounting variables...

Given that it is a redundant check under heavy load journal load
when access to the log grant/head/tail are already contended,
I think we should just be checking the "in current checkpoint" logic
and not making it conditional on the log being near full.

Cheers,

Dave.
