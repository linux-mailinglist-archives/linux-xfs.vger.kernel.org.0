I can change that, but that's the shutdown was handled by similar
code in the past, so it seemed appropriate here because this code
was hanging on shutdowns during development.

The random shutdown failures I kept seeing in shutdown tests says
otherwise.

The long-standing rule of thumb is "shutdown == abort in-progress IO
immediately", which is what I followed here when it became apparent
there was some kind of subtle shutdown issue occurring. That made
the shutdown problem go away.

It may be that changes I've been making to other parts of this
writeback code make the shutdown check here unnecessary. My testing
said otherwise, but maybe that's all been cleared up. Hence if the
shutdown check is truly unnecessary, let's clean it up in a future
patchset where that assertion can be bisected down cleanly.  I
needed this to get fstests to pass, and for this patchset which is
entirely unrelated to shutdown architecture, that's all the
justification that should be necessary.

Shutdown has *always* been brittle. You've seen it go from being
completely fucking awful to actually being somewhat reliable because
your experience with XFS matches to roughly when we first added
substantial shutdown validation to fstests.  We had a huge mountain
of technical debt around shutdown, but the importance of addressing
it has historically been pretty low because -shutdown is extremely
rare- in production systems.

I think the burden of proof is the wrong way around for the current
shutdown architecture. If you want to make a rule like this, you
need to fix define how the shutdown architecture is going to allow
this sort of rule to be applied without placing unreasonable demands
on the patch author.

Yes, I think this is an admirable goal, but I think you've got how
to get there completely backward.  First work out the architecture
and logic that allows us to remove/avoid "randomly" placed checks,
then work towards cleaning up the code. We don't get there by saying
"no new checks!" and then ignoring the underlying problems those
checks are trying to avoid.

If you can come up with a shutdown mechanism that:

	a) prevents all IO the moment a shutdown is triggered, and
	b) avoids shutdown detection ordering hangs between
	   different objects and subsystems,

then you have grounds for saying "nobody should need to add new
shutdown checks". But right now, that's not even close to being the
reality. There needs to be lots more cleanup and rework to the
shutdown code to be done before we get anywhere near this...

Repeated fstests hangs on various shutdown tests while developing
this code.

Cheers,

Dave.
