FWIW changing the on disk flag automatically flags the inode to be dropped as
soon as all references are done.

See:

2c567af418e3 fs: Introduce DCACHE_DONTCACHE
dae2f8ed7992 fs: Lift XFS_IDONTCACHE to the VFS layer

But from a users perspective you just don't know when that will happen.  The
system just can't guarantee it.  The best the user can do is stop taking
references to the file and close all references, and periodically check the
state.  But this will take a reference so...  Kind of a catch-22 here...  :-(
