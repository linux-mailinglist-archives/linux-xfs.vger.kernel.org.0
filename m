Where did you read that?

Current mkfs limits are UINT_MAX for stripe unit and stripe width (so width is the effective limiter in most cases)

Interestingly, in the kernel the limit on swidth is INT_MAX. In any case, quite large.

(However, the /log/ stripe unit has a limit of 256; if the data stripe unit is larger, the log stripe unit will automatically be reduced.)
