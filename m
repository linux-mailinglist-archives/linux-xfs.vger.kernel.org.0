I'm on the fence about that after the audit I did. It's only used
for bounds checking in one place in xfs_ialloc_ag_alloc() when
trying to do exact inode chunk allocation (for sequential inode
chunk layout). If it's not correct it doesn't matter (too small will
skip exact allocation, too large means exact allocation at EOAG will
fail) as we fall back to an "anywhere near target" allocation that
doesn't care about agi_length.

Hence the agi_length being wrong isn't going to cause fatal errors
at the moment, so it wasn't anywhere near as urgent to "fix" because
the code isn't actually broken right now...

-Dave.
