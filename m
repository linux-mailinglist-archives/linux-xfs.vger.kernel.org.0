Doh. So the ship has kind of sailed already anyway.

Projects are often (IMO far too) conservative with the features they use
in their headers and I don't think it's unreasonable to match the kernel
here.

so, I think we should match whatever linux-headers / the uapi rules are,
and given I've seen flexible array members in there, it's at least C99.

I did some quick greps and am not sure if we're using any C11 features
in uapi at least.

Just don't blame me if someone yells ;)

(kees, any idea if I'm talking rubbish?)

tl;dr: let's try gnu11?
