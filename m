You suggested we should consider "implement a zeroing fallocate",
and I've simply pointed out that it already exists. That is simply:

	fallocate(WRITE_ZEROES, old_eof, new_eof - old_eof)

You didn't say that you wanted something that isn't potentially
destructive when a buggy allocation allows multiple file extension
operations to be performed concurrently.

Providing non-destructive, "truncate up only" file extension
semantics through fallocate() is exactly what
FALLOC_FL_ALLOCATE_RANGE provides.

Oh, wait, we started down this path because the "fake" success patch
didn't implement the correct ALLOCATE_RANGE semantics. i.e. the
proposed patch is buggy because it doesn't implement the externally
visible file size change semantics of a successful operation.

IOWs, there is no need for a new API here - just for filesystems to
correctly implement the file extension semantics of
FALLOC_FL_ALLOCATE_RANGE if they are going to return success without
having performed physical allocation.

IOWs, I have no problems with COW filesystems not doing
preallocation, but if they are going to return success they still
need to perform all the non-allocation parts of fallocate()
operations correctly.

Again, I don't see a need for a new API here to provide
non-destructive "truncate up only" semantics as we already have
those semantics built into the ALLOCATE_RANGE operation...

-Dave.
