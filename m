The buffer reference is for the transaction. It is analogous to the
reference acquired in xfs_buf_find() via xfs_trans_[get|read]_buf(), for
example.

Yeah, I've already done pretty much this in my local tree. The callback
also takes the transaction because that's the code that knows how to add
a particular type of item to a transaction. I didn't require a callback
for the else case above where no special handling is required
(quotaoff), so the callback is optional, but I'm not opposed to
reworking things such that ->iop_relog() is always required if that is
preferred.

Yep.
