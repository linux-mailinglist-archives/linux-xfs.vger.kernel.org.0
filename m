The mechanism looks fine, comments below.

This really isn't commentary that is need for recovery - it should
be in the comment above xfs_reflink_recover_cow().

I'm not sure this last bit is necessary here - it's largely covered by
the commit message and the comment added to xfs_reflink_end_cow().

It seems to me that the comment here can be reduced to:

	/*
	 * Recover any CoW staging blocks that are still referenced by the
	 * ondisk refcount metadata.  During mount there cannot be any live
	 * staging extents as we have not run any user modifications.
	 * Therefore, it is safe to free them all right now, even on a
	 * read-only mount.
	 */

And the rest of the stuff about live staging extents vs on disk metadata state,
ro->rw remounts, etc all goes into an more complete explanation of the
limitations of xfs_reflink_recover_cow() in the comment above
xfs_reflink_recover_cow()....

This strikes me as something xfs_log_mount_finish() should do, as
it's a post-replay recovery operation and should be done before
we push the AIL and force the log at the end of log recovery....

Side note - I've noticed a lot of new comments are in the form of "X does Y,
which means A needs to do B". Speaking for myself, I find it much easier to
understand comments in the "rule before reason" form. i.e. "A needs to do B
because X does Y".

The rule that we need to follow (A needs to do B) is the important thing
readers need to understand and so it should be the primary object in the
sentence/paragraph. They don't necessarily need to understand exactly
why that rule needs to be followed, but they need to know about the rule.
Putting the rule after a chunk of complex reasoning means the importance/clarity
of the rule is lost/less obvious.

Rewritten in "rule before reason" form:

"Callers must ensure there are no COW staging extents attached to any cached
inodes as this function does not co-ordinate with cached inode COW forks."

Now it's obvious that until there is an interlock between
xfs_reflink_recover_cow() and cached inodes, this rule needs to be followed.
There's also no need to add commentary to say "this rule needs to be followed
until there's an interlock with cached inodes" because that's obvious from the
rule and the reason for the rule...

Cheers,

Dave.
