I don't think that was the issue - it was a practical concern that
having unnecessary log incompat fields set would prevent the common
practice of provisioning VMs with newer kernels than the host is
running.

The issue arises if the host tries to mount the guest VM image to
configure the clone of a golden image prior to first start. If there
are log incompat fields set in the golden image that was generated
by a newer kernel/OS image builder then the provisioning
host cannot mount the filesystem even though the log is clean and
recovery is unnecessary to mount the filesystem.

Hence on unmount we really want the journal contents based log
incompat bits cleared because there is nothing incompatible in the
log and so there is no reason to prevent older kernels from
mounting the filesytsem.

This is what incompat feature bits are for, not log incompat bits.
We don't need log incompat bits for pp, metaddir, rtgroups, etc
because older kernels won't even get to log recovery as they see
incompat feature bits set when they first read the superblock.

IOWs, a log incompat flag should only be necessary to prevent log
recovery on older kernels if we change how something is logged
without otherwise changing the on disk format of those items (e.g.
LARP). There are no incompat feature bits that are set in these
cases, so we need a log incompat bit to be set whilst the journal
has those items in it....

We can avoid that simply by not clearing the incompat bit at cover
time, and instead do it only at unmount. Then it only gets set once
per mount, and only gets cleared when we are running single threaded
on unmount. No need for locking at this point holding the superblock
buffer locked will serialise feature bit addition....

At this point they are just normal incompat feature bits. Why not
just use those instead? i.e. Why do we need log incompat bits to be
permanently sticky when we've already got incompat feature bits for
that?

Cheers,

Dave.
