I feel I have a decent understanding at this point, but the challenge 
atm is making it look pretty so it's not so hard for other to look at 
too.  In any case, I'd be happy to walk you through it some time :-)

I used to work on a team that was very fond of "screen" sessions, though 
maybe limited to people of a common org for vpn reasons.

That makes sense :-)

Yes, I think it would be a beneficial idea too.  Some of the prior teams 
I worked on would have internal reviews before sending things to the 
mailing lists.  It seemed to have the effect of things being a little 
more picked over before sending things to a wider scope of review.  Sort 
of like a low level phase of nits, before going to higher level phase of 
architecture.  It also had the effect of the internal reviewers better 
understanding the design intent before it goes out.  So they tended to 
be more engaged the high level discussion and less engaged on the nits. 
Comparatively it doesn't feel like we have as much division here, so 
everything just happens all at once and I think sometimes people get a 
bit lost in it all.  So perhaps the pair programing approach may help to 
bring a little more structure to our dev process.

Overtime, I suspect the 1x1's may also have the effect of peoples dev 
habits rubbing off on each other too.  Which in general tends to 
generate less things to have a difference of opinion about (in terms of 
design or styles).  People also tend to adopt similar configs or dev 
setups which helps to better pre-disposition them to help each other 
with it later.
