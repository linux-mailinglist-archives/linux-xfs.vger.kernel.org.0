It's not hard, but it's a treewide change to identify all the fstests
that are regression fixes (or at least mention a commit hash) and well
beyond the scope of adding tests for a new fallocate security behavior.

In fact, it's an *entirely new project*.  One that I don't have time to
take on myself as a condition for getting *this* patch merged.

It will *become* a new behavior, but I haven't spread it to any other
filesystems other than the three listed above.  Overlayfs, for example,
doesn't clear set.id bits or drop file capabilities, nor do things like
f2fs and fat.  I'll get to them eventually, but I think I'll have an
easier time persuading the other maintainers of this new behavior if I
can tell them "Here is a change, and this is an existing fstest that
checks the behavior for correctness."
