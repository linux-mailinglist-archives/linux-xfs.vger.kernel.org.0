That's the return of zero that causes the loop to make no progress.
i.e. a return of 0 means "won't fit in bio, allocate a new bio
and try again". It's not an error return, so always returning zero
will eventually chew up all your memory allocating bios it
doesn't use, because submit_bio() doesn't return errors on chained
bios until the final bio in the chain is completed.

Add a bio_add_page_checked() function that does exactly the same
this as bio_add_page(), but add the

	if (WARN_ON_ONCE((offset | len) & queue_dma_alignment(q)))
		return -EIO;

to it and change the xfs code to:

	while ((len = bio_add_page_checked(bio, page, len, off)) != len) {
		if (len < 0) {
			/*
			 * submit the bio to wait on the rest of the
			 * chain to complete, then return an error.
			 * This is a really shitty failure on write, as we
			 * will have just done a partial write and
			 * effectively corrupted something on disk.
			 */
			submit_bio_wait(bio);
			return len;
		}
		....
	}

We probably should change all the XFS calls to bio_add_page to
bio_add_page_checked() while we are at it, because we have the
same alignment problem through xfs_buf.c and, potentially, on iclogs
via xfs_log.c as iclogs are allocated with kmem_alloc_large(), too.

Cheers,

Dave.
