I can see the usefulness of having such information, but xfs_db is
the wrong tool/interface for generating such usage reports.

For example, xfs_db is not the right tool for probing online, active
filesystems. It is not coherent with the active kernel filesystem,
and is quite capable of walking off into la-la land as a result of
mis-parsing the inconsistent filesystem that is on disk underneath
active mounted filesystems. This does not make for a robust, usable
tool, let alone one that can make use of things like rmap for
querying usage and ownership information really quickly.

To solve this problem, we now have the xfs_spaceman tool and the
GETFSMAP ioctl for running usage queries on mounted filesystems.
That avoids all the coherency and crash problems, and for rmap
enabled filesystems it does not require scanning the entire
filesystem to work out this information (i.e. it can all be derived
from the contents of the rmap tree).

So I'd much prefer that new online filesystem queries go into
xfs-spaceman and use GETFSMAP so they can be accelerated on rmap
configured filesystems rather than hoping xfs_db will parse the
entire mounted filesystem correctly while it is being actively
changed...

BTW, "bytes" as a display unit is stupidly verbose and largely
unnecessary. The byte count is /always/ going to be a multiple of
the filesystem block size, and the first thing anyone who wants to
use this for diagnosis is going to have to do is return the byte
count to filesystem blocks (which is what the filesystem itself
tracks everything in. ANd then when you have PB scale filesystems,
anything more than 3 significant digits is just impossible to read
and compare - that "overhead" column (what the "overhead" even
mean?) is largely impossible to read and determine what the actual
capacity used is without counting individual digits in each number.

FWIW, we already have extent histogram code in xfs_spaceman
(in spaceman/freesp.c) and in xfs_db (db/freesp.c) so we really
don't need re-implementation of the same functionality we already
have duplicate copies of. I'd suggest that the histogram code should
be factored and moved to libfrog/ and then enhanced if new histogram
functionality is required...

Cheers,

Dave.
