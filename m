From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

When we call xfs_forced_shutdown(), the caller often expects the
filesystem to be completely shut down when it returns. However,
if we have racing xfs_forced_shutdown() calls, the first caller sets
the mount shutdown flag then goes to shutdown the log. The second
caller sees the mount shutdown flag and returns immediately - it
does not wait for the log to be shut down.

Unfortunately, xfs_forced_shutdown() is used in some places that
expect it to completely shut down the filesystem before it returns
(e.g. xfs_trans_log_inode()). As such, returning before the log has
been shut down leaves us in a place where the transaction failed to
complete correctly but we still call xfs_trans_commit(). This
situation arises because xfs_trans_log_inode() does not return an
error and instead calls xfs_force_shutdown() to ensure that the
transaction being committed is aborted.

Unfortunately, we have a race condition where xfs_trans_commit()
needs to check xlog_is_shutdown() because it can't abort log items
before the log is shut down, but it needs to use xfs_is_shutdown()
because xfs_forced_shutdown() does not block waiting for the log to
shut down.

To fix this conundrum, first we make all calls to
xfs_forced_shutdown() block until the log is also shut down. This
means we can then safely use xfs_forced_shutdown() as a mechanism
that ensures the currently running transaction will be aborted by
xfs_trans_commit() regardless of the shutdown check it uses.
