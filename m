Yeah, due to all these constraints, such reorder is much cleaner,
otherwise it needs forcely taking AGI lock in xfs_iunlink_remove()
in advance as what I did in my new v3 ( due to exist AGI lock in
xfs_difree() )...
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/xiang/linux.git/tree/fs/xfs/xfs_inode.c?h=xfs/iunlink_opt_v3#n2511
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/xiang/linux.git/commit/fs/xfs/xfs_inode.c?h=xfs/iunlink_opt_v3&id=79a6a18a7f13d12726c2554e2581a56fc473b152

Since the new based patchset is out, I will look into this patchset
and skip sending out my v3 (looks like the previous logging order
issues has been resolved) and directly rebase the rest patches
into v4.

Thanks,
Gao Xiang
