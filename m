Why? What uses the value? After this patchset the warning count is
not used anywhere in the kernel. Absent in-kernel enforced limits,
the warning count fundamentally useless as a userspace decision tool
because of the warning count is not deterministic in any way.
Nothing can be inferred about the absolute value of the count
because it can't be related back to individual user operations.

i.e. A single write() can get different numbers of warnings issuedi
simply because of file layout or inode config (e.g. DIO vs buffered,
writes into sparse regions, unwritten regions, if extent size hints
are enabled, etc) and so the absolute magnitude of the warning count
doesn't carry any significant meaning.

I still haven't seen a use case for these quota warning counts,
either with or without the limiting code. Who needs this, and why?

Once the warning count increment is removed, there are zero users of
the warning counts.

Legacy functionality policy (as defined by ALLOCSP removal) kicks in
here: remove anything questionable ASAP, before it bites us hard.
And this has already bitten us real hard...

Cheers,

Dave.
