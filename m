From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@kernel.org>

If we allocate quota inodes in the process of mounting a filesystem but
then decide to abort the mount, it's possible that the quota inodes are
sitting around pinned by the log.  Now that inode reclaim relies on the
AIL to flush inodes, we have to force the log and push the AIL in
between releasing the quota inodes and kicking off reclaim to tear down
all the incore inodes.

This was originally found during a fuzz test of metadata directories
(xfs/1546), but the actual symptom was that reclaim hung up on the quota
inodes.
