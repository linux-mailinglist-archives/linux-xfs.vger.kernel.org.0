True, libhandle is a very nice wrapper for the kernel ioctls.  I wish
Linux projects did that more often.  But suppose you're calling the
ioctls directly without libhandle and mess it up?

Me neither.  Though at this point there are a lot of filesystems that
implement ->get_parent, so I think removing XFS's will need a discussion
at least on linux-xfs, if not fsdevel.  In the meantime, getparents can
do minimal validation + iget for now and if it makes sense to port it
back to xfs_khandle_to_dentry, I can do that easily.

(FWIW turning off reconnection would likely fix some of the annoying
behaviors of xfs_scrub where it tries to open a dir to scan it and then
sprays dmesg with errors from unrelated parents as it stumbles over
reconnection only to fail the open, at which point it falls back to
scrubbing by handle anyway.)
