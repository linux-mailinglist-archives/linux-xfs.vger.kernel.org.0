Ah, got it.  I'll go back and review the test now.  Thanks for the
reminder.

> 2022-04-14 17:04 < zlang> Just due to notice your discussion in https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20220314180914.GN8224@magnolia/, and our downstream testing fails on xfs/144. So ask your plan :)
> 2022-04-14 22:53 < djwong> zlang: catherine is working on a patch to kill the warning counter limit feature entirely, since it's been largely busted for 20 years

> 2022-04-14 23:11 < zlang> djwong: I'm wondering one thing, after the "the warning counter" feature being merged, why there's not any xfstests quota related cases fail on it
> 2022-04-14 23:12 < zlang> That might mean we miss some testing coverage
> 2022-04-14 23:13 < zlang> Maybe some code branches we never through, likes the place where you add "res->warnings++" :)
> 2022-04-14 23:15 < zlang> Even for us, we get the complaint from customers, before we find this behavior change by our testing
> 2022-04-14 23:19 < sandeen> djwong, if catherine would like to send the one-liner ASAP to make the next kernel, that would be fantastic, with a followup to remove the rest of the code ;)
> 2022-04-14 23:19 < zlang> So I'd like to change xfs/144 to cover old quota warning expected behavior,  What do you think?
> 2022-04-14 23:19 < sandeen> zlang, what old quota warning expected behavior?
> 2022-04-14 23:21 < sandeen> to be clear, there are two notions of "warnings" here.  thre is a netlink interface which can send the user over-quota notices. That has been there a long time, and exists for vfs quota too. But that is not really related to the quota warning counter/limit code, which is unique to xfs, and broken.
> 2022-04-14 23:22 < zlang> sandeen: https://paste.centos.org/view/c66654c0
> 2022-04-14 23:22 < zlang> old behavior means this testing won't fail ^^
> 2022-04-14 23:23 < zlang> Before, we always write one single file until exceed soft limit
> 2022-04-14 23:23 < zlang> We never tested write several small files until exceed soft limit
> 2022-04-14 23:23 < sandeen> if I am reading the test correctly, you have a soft limit of 2 megs and a hard limit of 500 megs. And you have a grace period of 6 days.
> 2022-04-14 23:24 < sandeen> Then you write 202 megs immediately.
> 2022-04-14 23:24 < zlang> Yes, create ~100 2M file
> 2022-04-14 23:24 < sandeen> all of this happens before the 6 days grace period expires, so all writes should succeed.
> 2022-04-14 23:25 < zlang> Yes
> 2022-04-14 23:25 < zlang> Before, we generally write one single 200M file to test the soft limit
> 2022-04-14 23:25 < sandeen> with the quota warning limit patch, they do not succeed. but that, IMHO, was a bug which needs to be fixed.
> 2022-04-14 23:25 < sandeen> oh I see.
> 2022-04-14 23:26 < sandeen> so you're suggesting that another test which exceeds soft quota with many writes is a good idea, and would have caught the quota warning /limit/ problem - right?
> 2022-04-14 23:26 < sandeen> that sounds reasonable to me
> 2022-04-14 23:33 < zlang> Due to the warning counter feature broke our customers' environment at first, but our regression test pass as usual.
> 2022-04-14 23:36 < zlang> So I hope a test can detect this behavior change, even if we really like to change that in one day, we can remove/change this test then.
> 2022-04-14 23:43 < zlang> And don't worry, I'll write that test after you revert that feature, just ask your plans :)
