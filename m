X-SRS-Rewrite: SMTP reverse-path rewritten from <hch@infradead.org> by bombadil.infradead.org. See http://www.infradead.org/rpr.html

The data structure and support code looks fine to me, but I do have
some nitpicky comments and questions:

> -	/* Fork format. */
> -	unsigned int		if_format;
> -
> -	/* Number of records. */
> -	unsigned int		if_extents;
> +	/* Which fork is this btree being built for? */
> +	int			if_whichfork;

The two removed fields seems to be unused even before this patch.
Should they have been in a separate removal patch?

I also don't think all the #include churn belongs into this patch,
as the only existing header touched by it is xfs_btree_staging.h,
which means that anything that didn't need it before still won't
need it with the changes.

Where does this ~9% number come from?  Obviously it is a low-space
condition of some sort, but I wonder what are the criteria.  It would
be nice to document that here, even if the answer is
answer is "out of thin air".

Is this code really in the critical path that a division (or relying
on the compiler to do the right thing) is out of question?  Because
these shits by magic numbers are really annyoing to read (unlike
say normal SECTOR_SHIFT or PAGE_SHIFT ones that are fairly easy to
read).
