Right - that was the commit that introduced the shadow buffers...

Yes.

Ever since commit b1c5ebb21301 it's been necessary in certain
situations. Not just for intents, but for all log items that are
logged to the journal. i.e. inode, dquot and buffer log items free
li_lv_shadow in their destroy routines.

Essentially, until the last reference to the log item goes away, we
don't know if the CIL holds the other reference to the log item and
so may be actively using the shadow buffer. Hence the only time it
is actually safe to free the shadow buffer is when there are no
remaining references to the log item.

Thinking on it, in theory you are right. In practice, I think this
risk is very low, and KASAN certainly tells us it pretty much isn't
occuring during testing.

AFAICT the only likely time it was occurring is during forced
shutdowns when transactions are being cancelled between intent
commit and done-intent create/link. Once the done-intent is linked
to the intent, cleanup on shutdown seems to works correctly and we
don't have leaks occurring.

However, whiteouts effectively release the done-intent during commit
whilst leaving the whiteout intent as the sole reference to the log
item in the CIL, which then unpin-aborts it to clean it up rather
than chains it and frees it on checkpoint completion. Hence whiteouts
effectively drive a bulldozer through this window and so it was
leaking a BUI/RUI/CUI on every whiteout cancellation as the
CIL wasn't chaining and freeing the log vector that was built for
the commit.

Ok, will do.
