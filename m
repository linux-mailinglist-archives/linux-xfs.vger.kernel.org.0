I do like the idea of adding an explicit dax option, but I'm not sure
what the right policy would be:

1. -d dax option specified, set dax-compatible parameters irrespective
   of dax capability (blkid detection not strictly required)

2. -d dax option specified, set dax-compatible parameters only if
   blockdev is dax capable; fallback to default params otherwise

3. autodetect dax capability and automatically set dax-compatible
   params, irrespective of if the option is specified or not
   (potentially also needs an explicit override option e.g. -d dax=0).

I'd be inclined to go with the second option which should lead to the
least amount of surprises for users.

Still, this doesn't address the exact thing I was trying to do (see
below).

So I've been trying to prevent cases where users create a filesystem
with the default params, go on to populate it, and at some later point
of time find themselves wanting to mount it with dax only to realize
that this is not possible without mkfs (most commonly due to the
mismatch of the 64kB page size on ppc64). We could potentially just
issue the warning and not force mkfs to bail out, but I'm afraid that
warnings aren't very discernible and are easily missed. I do agree
though that requiring an override may not be the best model here.

Would it make sense to simply emit the warnings and drop the bail-out
and override logic altogether?

Alternatively the third option above (autodetection), would take care of
those cases at the expense of overriding otherwise potentially desirable
options (e.g. switching off reflink), which will come as a surprise to
users that don't intent to use dax. I don't think this would be a good
default policy.

The rationale here was to only make a distinction between destructive
and (conditionally) unusable, otherwise we would indeed need an override
toggle per warning - which I totally agree is an overkill. If implicitly
suppressing the destructive operation confirmation isn't a concern, then
I'd definitely drop this patch.

Thanks for the feedback!
