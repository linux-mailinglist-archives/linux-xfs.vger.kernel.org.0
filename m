Hi Darrick -

Just wanted to chime in with my support for this approach - both the
more collaborative concept, and the planning specifics. And I think
those will go hand in hand. If specific goals (patchsets) are agreed on
for a release, it will be easier for people to focus and help get those
goals accomplished.

Thanks for thinking about this and proposing a plan. It might take a
little time to shift behaviors and expectations, but I think this is
totally worth a shot.

Thanks,
-Eric
