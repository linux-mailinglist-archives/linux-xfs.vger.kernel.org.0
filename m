NFSv2 had a maximum client IO size of 8kB and writes were
synchronous. The Irix NFS server had some magic in it (enabled by
the filesystem wsync mount option) that allowed clients to have two
sequential 8k writes in flight at once, allowing XFS to optimise for
16KB write IOs instead of the normal default of 64kB. This
optimisation was the reason that, at the time (early-mid 90s), SGI
machines had double the NFS write throughput of any other Unix
systems.

I'm surprised we still support NFSv2 at all in this day and age - I
suspect we should just kill NFSv2 altogether. We need to keep the
wsync option around for HA systems serving files to NFS and CIFS
clients, but the 8kB IO size optimisations can certainly die....

Cheers,

Dave.
