Subject: [PATCH] Fix limits setting on XFS filesystem

xfs_commit_dquot() always set FS_DQ_LIMIT_MASK when calling
Q_XFS_SETQLIM. So far this wasn't a problem since quota tools didn't
support setting of anything else for XFS but now that kernel will start
supporting setting of grace times for XFS, we need to be more careful
and set limits bits only if we really want to update them. Also
FS_DQ_LIMIT_MASK contains real-time limits as well. Quota tools
currently don't support them in any way so avoid telling kernel to set
them.
