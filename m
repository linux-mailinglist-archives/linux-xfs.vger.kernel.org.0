xfs and ocfs2 return the rt extent size in stat.st_blksize.

In fstestsland you could use _get_file_block_size to figure out the
allocation unit.

Alternately, I've been testing a more permanent fix for the blocksize
issues[1]; perhaps that will fix the problem?

(Note that the series is at the end of my dev tree, so it's likely to
have apply errors for the tests that exist in djwong-dev but aren't
upstream.)
