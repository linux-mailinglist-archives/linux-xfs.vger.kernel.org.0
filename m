I can't speak for Christoph, but I am very much willing to continue
developing patches for fs/iomap, running the QA farm to make sure it's
working properly, and reviewing everyone else's patches.  Same as I do
now.

What I would like to concentrate on in the future are:

(a) improving documentation and cleanups that other fs maintainers have
    been asking for and I haven't had time to work on

(b) helping interested fs maintainers port their fs to iomap for better
    performance

(c) figuring out how to integrate smoothly with things like fsverity and
    fscrypt

(d) not stepping on *your* toes every time you want to change something
    in the vfs only to have it collide with iomap changes that you
    didn't see

Similar to what we just did with XFS, I propose breaking up the iomap
Maintainer role into pieces that are more manageable by a single person.
As RM, all you'd have to do is integrate reviewed patches and pull
requests into one of your work branches.  That gives you final say over
what goes in and how it goes in, instead of letting branches collide in
for-next without warning.

You can still forward on the review requests and bug reports to me.
That part isn't changing.  I've enjoyed working with you and hope
that'll continue well into the future. :)

I hope the above assuades your concerns/fears!

Quite the opposite, these are changes that I've been wanting to make for
months. :)
