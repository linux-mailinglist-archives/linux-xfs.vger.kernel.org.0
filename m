A couple updates..

First (as noted on irc), the generic/475 failure is not new as I was
able to produce it on vanilla 5.13.0-rc4. I'm not quite sure how far
back that one goes, but Dave noted he's seen it on occasion for some
time.

The generic/019 failure I'm seeing does appear to be new as I cannot
reproduce on 5.13.0-rc4. This failure looks more like silent fs
corruption. I.e., the test or log recovery doesn't explicitly fail, but
the post-test xfs_repair check detects corruption. Example xfs_repair
output is appended below (note that 'xfs_repair -n' actually crashes,
while destructive repair seems to work). Since this reproduces fairly
reliably on for-next, I bisected it (while also navigating an unmount
hang that I don't otherwise have data on) down to facd77e4e38b ("xfs:
CIL work is serialised, not pipelined"). From a quick glance at that I'm
not quite sure what the problem is there, just that it doesn't occur
prior to that particular commit.
