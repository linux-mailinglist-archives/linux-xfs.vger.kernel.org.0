btw, after checking xfs_check_summary_counts(), I think by now,
sb_fdblocks won't be recalculated if !xfs_sb_version_haslazysbcount
when suddenly power outages (with dirty log...)

So for !xfs_sb_version_haslazysbcount cases, we really rely on the
correct on-disk sb_fdblocks all the time...

Anyway, I also think we should warn !lazysb fs deprecated runtimely
by now (even we have XFS_SUPPORT_V4 build config.)
