The issue is that xfsdump installs the programs in /sbin but it *also* creates symlinks in /usr/sbin,
presumablly at some point the binaries were moved to /sbin but the developers wanted to keep
packages that hardcoded the paths working.

Those symlinks are suppressed if installing directly to a merged-usr system, which is fine for
end-users installing the program directly but isn't useful if installing to a destination dir for
packaing purposed.
