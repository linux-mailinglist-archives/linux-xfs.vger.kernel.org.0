This was exactly the case, the problem is, both xfstests patch and its xfsprogs
counterpart were sent under the same thread, which caused b4 to pull both of
them.
What I noticed (and haven't until I looked a bit deeper during my PTO) is that
b4 has an option to pull the patches into quilt format, so, that will make
things way easier.

Eitherway, I spoke with Darrick past night, and I'll rebase for-next to get rid
of that patch, there is no point in pushing it to a new xfsprogs release.
