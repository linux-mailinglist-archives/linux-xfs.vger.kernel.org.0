Ahhh, now I remember why the blockgc and inodegc workers call
sb_start_write before running any transactions.  We don't want the
threads to stall on transaction allocation when the fs is at FREEZE_FS,
which means that we have to cancel the work before we get there.  That
means it's too late to cancel the work items in xfs_fs_freeze.

We can't cancel the work items from a ->freeze_super handler before
calling freeze_super(), because we haven't taken any locks yet, and
we're still unfrozen.

For blockgc I solved this problem by making the worker get FREEZE_WRITE
protection so that we can't freeze the fs until the work is done.  Then
we don't have to care that much about ensuring that the worker threads
cannot run while the fs is frozen.  But that's a bit sloppy, since
they're still consuming CPU time.

I could solve this problem by observing that freeze_super calls
sync_filesystem when the fs is in FREEZE_PAGEFAULTS and is about to move
to FREEZE_FS, but that seems ugly and hacky.

Ah, ok.

Well yes, most bets are off during emergency ro-remounts. :)
