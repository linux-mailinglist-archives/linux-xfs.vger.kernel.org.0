Yes, I know of cloudy image generation factories that use old versions
of RHEL to generate images that are then frozen and copied to a
deployment system without an unmount.  I don't understand why they
insist that unmount is "too slow" but freeze isn't, nor why they then
file bugs that their instance deploy process is unacceptably slow
because of log recovery.

...but the next time anyone wants to introduce a new in/rocompat feature
flag for something inode related, then you can disable the "leave a
dirty log on freeze if there are unlinked inodes" behavior.
