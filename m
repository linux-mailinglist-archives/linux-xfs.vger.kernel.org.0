Ah, Ok. That all seems reasonably sane to me on a first pass, but I'm
not sure I'd go straight to this change given the situation...

Ok, that explains things a bit. My observation is that the first 5
patches or so address the mount failure problem, but from there I'm not
reproducing much difference with or without the final patch. Either way,
I see aborts and splats all over the place, which implies at minimum
this isn't the only issue here.

So given that 1. growfs recovery seems pretty much broken, 2. this
particular patch has no straightforward way to test that it fixes
something and at the same time doesn't break anything else, and 3. we do
have at least one fairly straightforward growfs/recovery test in the
works that reliably explodes, personally I'd suggest to split this work
off into separate series.

It seems reasonable enough to me to get patches 1-5 in asap once they're
fully cleaned up, and then leave the next two as part of a followon
series pending further investigation into these other issues. As part of
that I'd like to know whether the recovery test reproduces (or can be
made to reproduce) the issue this patch presumably fixes, but I'd also
settle for "the grow recovery test now passes reliably and this doesn't
regress it." But once again, just my .02.
