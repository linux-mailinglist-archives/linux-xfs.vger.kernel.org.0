Here is an update of the error.  If something looks off, let me know and 
I'll double check I transcribed correct.  Let me know if there is a way 
to post a screenshot.

XFS (dm-2): metadata I/O error in “xlog_recov_do..(read#2)” at daddr 
0x1b32 error 117

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

My computer is an older CentOS 6 box (on my todo list to replace).  I 
have an array of VirtualBox VMs.  All my data including VMs is in 
/home/brian directory.  I run rsync to backup /home/brian directory to a 
USB drive.  Rsync treats the files of the VM just like any other file.  
I noticed that the VMs can get corrupted if I leave them running during 
back up with rsync so I normally shut them down.  For this instance, I 
didn't shut down the VM when I launched rsync.

@Dave
Regarding your image file question, I don't believe the above is an 
image file.  Rsync copies file by file.  And I can navigate to the USB 
like my internal hdd.

Regarding the freeze files system, no I did not freeze the guest.

Regarding the older backups, I just have the rsync backup on a USB 
drive.  I've been working with a copy from the USB to try at get this 
machine back, thus the unmodified USB rsync that was taken while the 
machine was running exists.

While rsync was running, I had Selenium running web app tests in 
Chrome.  All the data from my program was being written to a shared 
folder.  Chrome has it's own internal cache that could be changing but 
overall, I wouldn't expect the file system to be changing too much 
especially the booting part.

My ultimate goal is to get to the data on this VM.  I've tried to mount 
this .vdi file in another instance of CentOS but have not been 
successful.  I may spin up an Ubuntu instance to try to get to the 
data.  The data on this VM can be recreated but I prefer not to have to 
redo the work.

Thank you for your help.

Brian
