I'm not worried by the EFIs themselves when they are created and
committed, it's the processing of the XEFIs which are all done in a
single transaction unless a ->finish_item() call returns -EAGAIN.
i.e. it's the xfs_trans_free_extent() calls that are done one after
another, and potential log different AG metadata blocks on each
extent free operation....

And it's not just runtime we have to worry about - if we crash and
have to recover on of these EFIs with 16 extents in it, we have the
problem of processing a 16 extent EFI on a single transaction
reservation, right?

I suspect it might be different with aged filesystems where the
extents being freed could be spread across many, many btree leaf
nodes...
