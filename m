Forward declarations aren't the problem, but I wanted to avoid having
to pull xfs_da_btree.h into all users of the external xattr API.  It
turns out that is just three new files, so it probably isn't too bad.

I have a new tree with this move dropped, but I'm going to wait a little
before I resend to see if there are any other comments.
