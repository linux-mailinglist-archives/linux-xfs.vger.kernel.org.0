<nod> That's going to be a long treewide change, I suspect.

Hmm, let me think about that.

It occurs to me that regular truncate-down on a shared block can also
return ENOSPC if the filesystem is completely out of space.  Though I
guess in that case, at least df will say that nearly zero space is
available, whereas for zoned storage we might have plenty of free space
that simply isn't available right now... right?
