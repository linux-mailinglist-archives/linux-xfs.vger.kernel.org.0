OK, now I think I've finally put all the pieces together.  Both of these
patches are fixing weirdness when MKFS_OPTIONS="-m reflink=1 -b size=1k".

With current HEAD, we try to mkfs.xfs with double "-b size" arguments.
That fails with 'option respecified', so fstests tries again without
MKFS_OPTIONS, which means you don't get the filesystem that you want.
If, say, MKFS_OPTIONS also contained bigtime=1, you won't get a bigtime
filesystem.

So the first patch removes the double -bsize arguments.  But you still
have the problem that the reflink=1 in MKFS_OPTIONS still causes
mkfs.xfs to fail (because we don't do rt and reflink yet), so fstests
again drops MKFS_OPTIONS, and now you're testing the fs without a block
size option at all.  The test still regresses because the special rt
geometry depends on the blocksize, and we didn't get all the geometry
elements that we need to trip the growfs failure.

Does the following patch fix all that for you?
