So the comment below this new hunk is all about AGI vs AGF ordering
and how we do the unlink first to grab the AGI before the AGF. But
noew we are adding explicit AGI locking for the case where unlink
list locking is required, thereby largely invalidating the need
for special casing the unlink list removal right up front.

Next question: The target_ip == NULL case below this (the
xfs_dir_repace() case) does this:

	/*
	 * Check whether the replace operation will need to allocate
	 * blocks.  This happens when the shortform directory lacks
	 * space and we have to convert it to a block format directory.
	 * When more blocks are necessary, we must lock the AGI first
	 * to preserve locking order (AGI -> AGF).
	 */
	if (xfs_dir2_sf_replace_needblock(target_dp, src_ip->i_ino)) {
		error = xfs_read_agi(mp, tp,
				XFS_INO_TO_AGNO(mp, target_ip->i_ino),
				&agibp);
		if (error)
			goto out_trans_cancel;
	}

IOWs, if we are actually locking AGIs up front, this can go away,
yes?

Seems to me that we should actually do a proper job of formalising
the locking in the rename code, not hack another special case into
it and keep all the other special case hacks that could go away if
the whole AGI/AGF locking order thing were done up front....

And with it formalised, we can then think about how to get rid of
those lock order dependecies altogether....

Cheers,

Dave.
