Yeah.  So I've sort of figured out how to spoof crc32c in much the same
way that obfuscate_name() does for the dahash -- fill a buffer with
replacement characters, figure out which bits to flip to end up with the
same crc at the end.  I quickly found Mark Adler's spoof program which
seems to work more reliably.

But after a bit of performance comparison, I realized that constructing
namehash collisions with same-length strings is about as computationally
easy with crc32c as it is with the dahash.  This isn't any better than
what we have now.  I ran a dumb benchmark of the kernel crc32c
implementation vs. dahash and noticed that for the sizes we care about
(i.e. 255 bytes or less) the old dahash is only slightly slower than
hardware accelerated crc32c.

I then noticed that obfuscate_name() totally does the wrong thing if
ascii-ci is enabled, and indeed, trying to metadump such a filesystem
causes metadump to throw errors all over the place.

In short: doing this doesn't buy us anything, but now someone has to
implement a robust obfuscate_name() for crc32c and we have more software
to maintain.

For now I've fixed this by implementing a gigantic name remapping table
so that we remember (dir_ino, old_name, new_name) tuples.  When we
encounter the equivalent parent pointer, we can use the exact same
obfuscated name, which means that xfs_repair on a restored obscured
metadump works again.

While I was at it, I also implemented a 'parent' command for xfs_db that
dumps the parents of any inode, similar to the existing xfs_io command.

Now that I've had a day to go sift through all of these changes, I've
realized that you're right -- putting the ondisk format back to:

   (parent_ino, parent_gen, namehash) -> (dirent name)

Simplifes the parent pointer ondisk conversion and runtime code quite a
bit.  It also makes it easy to implement obfuscated metadumps.  So I'll
go run v11 through fstestscloud with all of today's changes integrated,
and we'll see about getting something out in a few days.

Again, sorry for being a jerk.
