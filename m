...and which version is that?  The build robot report just says ia64
without specifying any details about what compiler was running, etc:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20230510165934.5Zgh4%25lkp@intel.com/T/#u

I'll see if I can fix it, but there's not enough information to
reproduce the exact circumstances of the warning.  I've been building
this branch with gcc 11.3 on x86_64, aarch64, ppc64le, s390x, and
riscv64, and none of them complained.  I normally build the fs/xfs code
with most of the W=12e options enabled, though I confess to turning off
the warnings that trigger on random bits of source code outside xfs.

I don't have access to any ia64 environment, let alone whatever build
farm Intel has.

The PR message didn't specify what warning was being ignored.  Assuming
it's the one the build robot found, would you actually revert a commit
over a build warning about unreachable code *only* on ia64?

The real fixes for the code that I turned off are sufficiently involved
that we had to have a session about it at LSFMM.  There's no way to
merge it now; the window is closed.
