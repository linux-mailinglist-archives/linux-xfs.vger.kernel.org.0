[ Chris grimaces and glances over at the 8+3 erasure-encoded ceph rbd 
   sitting like a pitch drop experiment in the corner. ]

Speaking of slow storage and metadata write intensive workloads, what's 
the reason reflinks with a realtime device isn't supported? That was one 
approach I wanted to try, to get the metadata ops running on a small fast 
storage with the bulk data sitting on big slow bulk storage. But:

# mkfs.xfs -m reflink=1 -d rtinherit=1 -r rtdev=/dev/fast /dev/slow
reflink not supported with realtime devices

My naive thought was a reflink was probably "just" a block range 
referenced from multiple places, and probably a refcount somewhere. It 
seems like it should be possible to have the range, references and 
refcount sitting on the fast storage pointing to the actual data blocks on 
the slow storage.

Thanks - that did it.

Cheers,
