I didn't realize the conversation was already going on before I replied for the
first time, my apologies for unnecessary emails.

I've been working on some patches about this issue since I had this chat with
Dave, but I do not have anything 'mature' yet, exactly because some of the
issues you mentioned above, like the behavior not being exclusive to an empty
AG, and the fact the generic/223 was still failing after the 'fix' has been
applied (the single large fallocated file worked, but generic/223 no), so I was
kind of chasing my own tails on Friday :D

I'll get back to it today and see what I can do with fresh eyes.

Thanks Dave and Brian.
