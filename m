Disclose: I don't speak for my company. So the following is just
my own thoughts.

It may be true in 2023, however, the only resource now is me (I
suspect there will be more resource), but I still have other work
to do on my hand which impacts my own performance review more.
For this issue, I spent much time (up to the mid-night) last week
to find out, which greatly impact my own physical health.  Yes,
I will speed more on this, but:

There is no clear evidence that a cloud image could directly benefit
to our AI infra.  So from POV of a company, the worst case is that
they may revisit the overall benefits among all possible choices and
find out the best one.

Anyway, I've got the community view of Unixbench.  I will arrange my
own TODO list.

Thanks,
Gao Xiang
