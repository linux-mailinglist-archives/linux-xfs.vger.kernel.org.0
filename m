it's the difference between actually releasing the lock itself, and
telling lockdep that we're releasing the "ownership" of the lock for tracking
purposes; I agree that "rwsem_release" is a bit confusingly named.

Other code I see just calls rwsem_release directly - ocfs2, jbd2, kernfs etc.

I think a clearer comment might suffice, not sure what Darrick thinks, maybe something
like this:

+	/*
+	 * Let lockdep know that we won't own i_lock when we hand off
+	 * to the worker thread
+	 */
+	rwsem_release(&cur->bc_ino.ip->i_lock.dep_map, _THIS_IP_);
 	queue_work(xfs_alloc_wq, &args.work);
+
 	wait_for_completion(&done);
+	/* We own the i_lock again */
+	rwsem_acquire(&cur->bc_ino.ip->i_lock.dep_map, 0, 0, _RET_IP_);

and similar comments in the worker:

+	/* Let lockdep know that we own the i_lock for now */
+	rwsem_acquire(&args->cur->bc_ino.ip->i_lock.dep_map, 0, 0, _RET_IP_);
...

etc
