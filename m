Yes, that is much better from the perspective of spilting patches and
I thought that before. It seems that is like 2 steps but the proposed
target solution is as a whole (in other words, 2 steps are code-related)
and I'm not sure how large these code is sharable or can be inherited
but rather than introduce some code in patch 2 and then remove immediately
and turn into a new code in patch 3). I'm not sure how large logic could
be sharable between these 2 dependent steps so I didn't do that.

I will spilt patches in the next RFC version to make a try.

Yeah, It has been documented in the following.

+xfs_iunlink(
 	struct xfs_trans	*tp,
-	struct xfs_buf		*agibp,
 	struct xfs_inode	*ip)
 {
 	struct xfs_mount	*mp = tp->t_mountp;

-	xfs_agino_t		agno = XFS_INO_TO_AGNO(mp, ip->i_ino);
+	xfs_agnumber_t		agno = XFS_INO_TO_AGNO(mp, ip->i_ino);
+	struct xfs_perag	*pag;
+	struct xfs_inode	*pip;
 	xfs_agino_t		agino = XFS_INO_TO_AGINO(mp, ip->i_ino);
-	xfs_agino_t		next_agino;
+	int			error;
+
+	ASSERT(VFS_I(ip)->i_nlink == 0);
+	ASSERT(VFS_I(ip)->i_mode != 0);
+	trace_xfs_iunlink(ip);
+
+	pag = xfs_perag_get(mp, agno);

(adding some notes here, this patch doesn't use try lock here
 finally but unlock perag and take AGI and relock and recheck tail_empty....
 since the tail non-empty is rare...)

Yeah, the _lock and _unlock pair is helpful, I will go for this direction.
