It looks to me it just checks some state bit and only does any work if
actually necessary. I suppose not doing that less often is cheaper than
doing it more, but it's not clear to me it's enough that it really
matters and/or warrants more code to filter out calls..

What exactly did you have in mind for logic? I suppose we could always
stuff a 'if (!(count++ % 1024)) cond_resched();' or some such in the
inner loop, but that might have less of an effect on larger chains
constructed of bios with fewer pages (depending on whether that might
still be possible).
